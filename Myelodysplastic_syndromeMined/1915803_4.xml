<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> on in vitro growth of human bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cells from 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and 5 myelodysplastic patients, and on in vivo hemopoiesis in 30 patients with hypoplastic or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At concentrations similar to that reported as the plasma level after oral administration, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> significantly increased CFU-GM colony growth in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, while the influence on CFU-E, BFU-E, CFU-MK and CFU-GEMM colony growth was less evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory effect on CFU-GM was observed even after accessory cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Np stimulatory effect either in vitro on the growth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hemopoietic progenitors or in vivo was observed in 15 myelodysplastic patients, while 7 complete and 3 partial hematological responses occurred in 15 patients with hypoplastic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> exerts a direct stimulatory activity in vitro at least on CFU-GM, and a hemopoietic stimulatory effect in vivo in hypoplastic but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
