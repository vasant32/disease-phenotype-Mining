<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the location of genes on 7q that are likely to play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>, we examined the deleted chromosome 7 homologs in a series of 81 patients with therapy-related or de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our analysis showed that the deletions were interstitial and that there were two distinct deleted segments of 7q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (65 of 81 [80%]) had proximal breakpoints in bands q11-22 and distal breakpoints in q31-36; the smallest overlapping deleted segment was within q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 16 patients had deletions involving the distal q arm with a commonly deleted segment of q32-33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To define the proximal deleted segment at 7q22 at a molecular level, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization with a panel of mapped yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones from 7q to examine 15 patients with deletion breakpoints in 7q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We determined that the smallest overlapping deleted segment is contained in a well-defined YAC contig that spans 2 to 3 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies delineate the region of 7q that must be searched to isolate a putative myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> suppressor gene, and provide the necessary cloned DNA for more detailed physical mapping and gene isolation </plain></SENT>
