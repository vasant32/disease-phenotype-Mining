<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined this recommendation in the early phase of allogeneic transplantation, where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> levels potentially becoming subtherapeutic following upfront dose reduction would be deleterious to transplant outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data show that while posaconazole leads to an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> levels, subsequent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> dose reduction can be safely guided by therapeutic drug monitoring and is not required upfront </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the current recommendation may be modified </plain></SENT>
