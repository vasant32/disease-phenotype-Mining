<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The APC gene is located at chromosome band 5q23, and is deleted in more than 95% of patients with a -5/del(5q), raising the question of whether haploinsufficiency of APC contributes to the development of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with loss of 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that conditional inactivation of a single allele of Apc in mice leads to the development of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further characterization of the erythroid lineage revealed that erythropoiesis is blocked at the early stages of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) and short-term <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> (ST-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) populations are expanded in Apc-heterozygous mice compared with the control littermates; however, the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> have a reduced capacity to regenerate hematopoiesis in vivo in the absence of a single allele of Apc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apc heterozygous myeloid progenitor cells display an increased frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and decreased in vitro colony-forming capacity, recapitulating several characteristic features of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with a -5/del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that haploinsufficiency of Apc impairs hematopoiesis, and raise the possibility that loss of function of APC contributes to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
