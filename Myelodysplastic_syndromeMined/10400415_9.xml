<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eligibility criteria included an Hb level of less than 10.5 g/dl for newly diagnosed patients, or symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF was given at a dose of 3 microg/kg s.c. on days 1-2, rhEpo at a dose of 60 U/kg s.c. on days 3-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No treatment was given on days 6-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed-up with full blood count on a weekly basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatment was repeated for a total of 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At that time, if a rise in Hb above 1.5 g/dl had not been achieved, the dose of rhEpo increased to 120 U/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment evaluation was performed at the completion of 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Erythroid response was defined as good (GR), if an increase in untransfused Hb values above 2 g/dl or a 100% decrease in red blood cell transfusion requirements, over the treatment period was observed, while an increase in untransfused Hb values 1-2 g/dl or a &gt;50% decrease in transfusion requirements, were considered as partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Responders continued to receive the same treatment until disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (13 male and six female) with a median age of 69 years were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The FAB subtypes were: RA one case, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> eight cases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ten of 19 patients (52.6%) responded to the treatment: 7/19 (36.8%) achieved a GR and 3/19 (15.8%) a PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six of eight (75%) patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, one case with RA and 3/10 (30%) of cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> responded to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment serum epo levels were generally low (less than 200 Mu/ml) in responding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At the completion of the initial 12 weeks, 8/12 responding patients (5 <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, 2 RAEB and 1 RA) continued to receive the same treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responding patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> continued to show an erythroid response in a time period from 3 to 24 months, whilst one patient with RA and two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> did not have a continuing response at 2, 4 and 12 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The above data suggest that the combination of rhEpo and GM-CSF should be recommended in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
