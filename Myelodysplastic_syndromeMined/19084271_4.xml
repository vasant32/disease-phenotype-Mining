<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that various hematopoietic lineages in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may carry different cytogenetically cryptic genomic aberrations leading to lineage-specific manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry sorting was performed to sort 12 MDS marrow samples into blastic, erythroid, immature myeloid and lymphoid fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fractions with enough DNA underwent 250K SNP microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of importance, different chromosomal regions of UPD, deletions and/or gains were present in different fractions of same patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only small percentages (6.7%) of genomic aberrations were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fractions from same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that multiple distinct clones may co-exist in different lineages in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may contribute to cytopenias in specific lineages and the significant clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> observed in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings and to investigate the lineage specific genomic lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
