<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the potential of bone marrow CD34(+) progenitors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients to proliferate and differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs) in a cytokine-supplemented liquid culture system and analysed the status of blood DC subsets in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD34(+) progenitors had low potential to generate DCs in vitro, as the number of DCs obtained from one CD34(+) cell was significantly lower compared with controls (median value 0.2 vs. 4, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients, the survival and proliferation of CD34(+) cells in culture was not correlated to the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phenotypically and functionally CD34(+)-derived DCs were similar in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of both circulating DC subsets in patients was extremely diminished compared with controls (myeloid DC: 0.10 +/- 0.10% vs. 0.35 +/- 0.13%, P &lt; 0.001; plasmacytoid DC: 0.11 +/- 0.10% vs. 0.37 +/- 0.14%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases with the 5q deletion both CD34-derived DCs and blood DCs harboured the cytogenetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the production of DCs is affected by the neoplastic process resulting in ineffective 'dendritopoiesis' with low blood DC precursor numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This quantitative DC defect probably contributes to the poor immune response against infectious agents and to the escape of the malignant clone from immune recognition with disease progression towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
