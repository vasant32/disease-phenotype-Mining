<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study compared posttransplant engraftment parameters in 203 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (MF) with those in a population of 203 matched controls without MF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between these groups in the proportions of patients who died without achieving engraftment and in the disease-free survival distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, comparisons between the two groups of patients reaching the respective endpoints showed no differences in the time distributions for reaching 0.5 or 1.0 x 10(9)/L granulocytes, but the time to platelet transfusion independence was 3 days longer in patients with MF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In further analysis, results for 33 patients with severe MF were compared with those of their respective controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients with severe MF who died without reaching these engraftment endpoints and the disease-free survival distributions in the two groups were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients who reached the respective engraftment endpoints, there was no statistically significant difference in the pace of granulocyte recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with severe MF, there was a 7-day delay in the time to reach platelet transfusion independence and a 2-day delay in the time to reach red blood cell independence, but the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present results do not substantiate concerns raised by earlier studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MF may delay the time to reach platelet independence by approximately 3 days and may increase platelet transfusion requirements, but no other perturbation of hematopoietic reconstitution was apparent </plain></SENT>
