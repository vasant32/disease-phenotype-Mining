<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reviewed clinical and cytogenetic characteristics of patients with t-MN at a single institution in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study subjects included 39 consecutive patients diagnosed with t-MN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each subject's clinical history of previous diseases, treatments, and laboratory data was reviewed, including cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary diagnosis was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> in 14 patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> in 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 66.7%) was found to be more common than therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> that were commonly implicated included mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> was the most common primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean time interval from cytotoxic therapy initiation to t-MN detection was 49 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal aberrations were observed in 35 patients, and loss of chromosome 5, 7, or both accounted for 41% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Balanced rearrangements occurred in 13 patients; these patients showed shorter latency intervals (mean, 38 months) than patients with loss of chromosome 5 or 7 (mean, 61 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we determined the clinical and cytogenetic characteristics of Korean patients with t-MN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although our results were generally consistent with those of previous reports, we found that t-MN resulting from de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was common and that t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was more common than t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multi-institutional studies involving a larger number of patients and additional parameters are required to investigate the epidemiology, genetic predisposition, and survival rate of t-MN in Korea </plain></SENT>
