<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases were treated with the drug over 90 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these, 10 showed improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, 12 an increase in platelet count which had decreased before treatment and 10 an increase in neutrophil count; however, 14 showed an increase in blast percentage in bone marrow aspirate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD4/CD8 ratio was increased in 4 cases and shifted to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> from an abnormal range in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), great improvement was seen, but in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> increase in blast percentage was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD4 increased mostly in RA and CD8 increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) were first treated with ubenimex and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatics</z:chebi>, then with ubenimex only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six cases attained partial remission within 3 months, but one case showed a marked increase in white cell count and blast count and in another case a progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> associated with increase in white cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these findings we conclude that ubenimex could be utilized in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> if the patient was at risk for strong chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
