<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Markedly decreased level of platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> GPIIb was observed in the patient's platelets by terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> labelling method, whereas no significant changes in the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> including GPIIb could be detected either by penultimate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> labelling or by tyrosine/histidine labelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a decreased sialylation of GPIIb in the patient's platelets, implying aberrant process in thrombopoiesis in the disease </plain></SENT>
