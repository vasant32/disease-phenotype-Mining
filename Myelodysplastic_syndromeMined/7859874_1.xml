<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a pilot study in 10 anaemic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to examine whether sequentially applied recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and Epo improves <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels and/or reduces red blood cell transfusion requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphological diagnoses of patients were refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA) in 3 cases, RA with ring sideroblasts in 3 cases and RA with excess blasts in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF was given subcutaneously at a dose of 150 micrograms/m2/d during the initial 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From day 11, Epo was administered by subcutaneous injections for 8 weeks at a dose of 100 U/kg/d and subsequently at an escalated dose of 200 U/kg/d in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in reticulocyte counts, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, RBC support and ferrokinetic parameters were compared with pretreatment values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two out of 8 evaluable patients showed a rise in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> levels at week 8 and 10, respectively, and lost their transfusion dependency for a period of 13 and 27 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level increased only after dose escalation of Epo (200 U/kg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte counts remained uneffected by treatment with Epo, while 1 patient showed a 4-fold increase in platelet numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and global <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, respectively, unrelated to growth factor therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on this pilot study, we conclude that sequential treatment with GM-CSF and Epo does not increase erythroid responses in anaemic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of the delayed increase in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> in both responders, we surmise that the beneficial effects were induced by Epo alone </plain></SENT>
