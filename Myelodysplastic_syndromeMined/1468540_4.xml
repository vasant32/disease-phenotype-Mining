<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the methylation status of CCGG sites in and around the human proto-oncogene c-myc in blood cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemias</z:hpo> and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> using restriction endonucleases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5' region of c-myc was unequivocally hypomethylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 58 specimens studied, including 10 from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and 1 from human placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the 3' region was hypermethylated in a great majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, this region was hypomethylated in 1 of 12 patients with de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, 1 of 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 4 of 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> preceded by a documented stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One possible mechanism for the 3' region of c-myc to have remained hypomethylated may be a "delayed methylation" during transforming events toward a more aggressive stage of the disease, but the precise mechanism is unknown </plain></SENT>
