<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its clinical and prognostic significance is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the records of 1187 consecutive patients with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven (3.3%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21: four (0.3%) as the only cytogenetic abnormality and 33 (2.7%) with other cytogenetic abnormalities (-5 and/or -7 in 15, +8 in nine, t(15;17) in three, inv(16) in three, t(8;21) in one, and hyperdiploid with several other additional chromosomes in two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patients had megakaryocytic phenotype (M7), common in patients with constitutional <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 57% achieved complete remission (CR), with median CR duration of 39 weeks, and median survival of 31 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When patients with additional cytogenetic abnormalities were compared to patients with similar abnormalities but no <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21, their clinical features as well as their CR rate, CR duration and survival were similar, with or without <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> typically presents in conjunction with other cytogenetic abnormalities, especially -5/-7 and +8 whose presence rather than the presence of +21 dictates the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
