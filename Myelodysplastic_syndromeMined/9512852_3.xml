<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> underwent Caesarean section on two occasions </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In her second pregnancy at 25 yr, there was severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> at 28-wk gestation with a leukocyte count 3.6 x 10(9).L-1, erythrocyte count 1.2 x 10(12).L-1, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> 50 g.L-1, haematocrit 14.7% and platelet count 51 x 10(9).L-1 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An exact assessment of the haematological condition, the need for prophylactic treatment and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> management should be determined for each individual patient </plain></SENT>
