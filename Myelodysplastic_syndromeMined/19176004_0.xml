<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the WHO classification, clinical and hematological features and risk group of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The diagnosis and classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were defined according to the WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations, hemogram, bone marrow biopsy and prognosis were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 47 yrs being younger than that in some foreign reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of abnormal karyotype was 35.14% and +8 was the most frequent abnormal karyotype in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 74 patients transformed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that age, chromosome abnormality, percentage of bone marrow blast cells and number of cytopenias were significantly related to prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a statistical difference in cum survival rate between IPSS subcategories (P &lt; 0.05) except that between low- and intermediate I-risk subcategory (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were statistical differences for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) vs RA with excess blast (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), refractory cytopenias with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) vs <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-I</z:e> vs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were differences in age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, distribution of WHO, sub-classification and abnormal karyotype in this cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients as compared with those in Europe and Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is helpful in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis to divide <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-I</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IPSS was well applicable in Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
