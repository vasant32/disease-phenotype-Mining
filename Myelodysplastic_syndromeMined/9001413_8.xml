<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (median age 61 years) with sAML (25 patients) or tAML (nine patients) entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Induction course consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> (12 mg/m2 of body-surface area per day for 3 days) and intermediate-dose (ID) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in the 24 younger patients (1 g/m2 of body-surface area as a 2 h infusion every 12 h for 5 days) or standard-dose (SD) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in the 10 older patients (100 mg/m2 of body-surface area per day as a continuous infusion for 7 days), followed by G-CSF until neutrophil recovery or treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (56%, 13/24 in the ID group and 6/10 in the SD group) achieved a CR (14/25 sAML and 5/9 tAML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in four patients, but four additional patients died in CR from treatment-related toxicity (overall toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate 24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial cytogenetics was available in 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CR rate was significantly lower in patients with unfavorable cytogenetics compared to patients with intermediate cytogenetics (37% vs 79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median remission duration and overall survival were 3 and 9 months, respectively and not different between ID and SD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the treatment-related toxicity is high, a high CR rate can be obtained in these poor-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with the use of intensive chemotherapy in combination with G-CSF, although the role of the latter is still to be proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results remain especially poor in patients with unfavorable cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>New approaches are needed to maintain remission in these high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
