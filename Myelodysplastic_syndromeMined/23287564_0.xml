<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This action is S-phase dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, genetic factors that decrease the half-lives of these drugs could impact efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Documentation of such impact, and elucidation of underlying mechanisms, could lead to improved clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental design: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">Cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e>) rapidly inactivates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> SNP A79C and gender on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> expression, enzyme activity, and drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics was examined in mice and humans, and the impact on overall survival (OS) was evaluated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>-treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 90) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>-treated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (n = 76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> activity was decreased as expected in individuals with the SNP A79C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly and significantly, there was an even larger decrease in females than in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Explaining this decrease, liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> expression was significantly lower in female versus male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As expected, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> plasma levels, measured by mass spectrometry, were significantly higher in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In mathematical modeling, the detrimental impact of shorter drug half-life (e.g., in males) was greater in low compared with high S-phase fraction disease (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> vs. <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), because in high S-phase fraction disease, even a short exposure treats a major portion of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in multivariate analysis, OS was significantly worse in male versus female patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> expression/activity in males contributes to decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> analog half-life and likely contributes to worse outcomes with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
