<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Erythroid precursors (EPs) may be indistinguishable from myeloblasts in BM sections (aspirate clots/cores) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compare the usefulness of immunohistochemistry (IHC) [ie, CD34, CD117, myeloperoxidase (MPO), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1 (HbA1), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)] of BM sections (IHC-BM) with BMA, bone marrow touch preparation (BMTP), and flow cytometry (FC) BCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The initial BC (48), percentage (%) of Eps (38) (both based on initial 100 to 600-cell counts), and FC expressions of CD34, CD117, Glycophorin A(GLY A), and TdT (44) were tabulated from 50 BMs (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMAs (48) and BMTPs (25) subsequently received 500-cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IHC-BM was performed (45:formalin, 5:B5-fixed) [CD34 (46), CD117 (45), HbA1 (45), TdT (42), and MPO (45)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Retrospective BMA BCs revealed a 31% (15/48) discrepant rate between the original/retrospective BMA BCs; 80% revealed an underestimated initial BC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a 28% discordance rate between the retrospective BMA and BMTP reviews; 77% showed a higher BMTP BC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IHC showed significantly higher BCs in 19% (9/47), resulting in a different dx (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, CD34 and CD117 IHCS revealed lower BCs in 38% and 48%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CD34 IHC results were primarily due to CD34-negative blasts by FC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CD117 IHC results were largely unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>EPs were CD34 and CD117-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) Evaluation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> requires 500-cell counts of BMAs and/or BMTPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(2) CD34 and/or CD117 blasts by FC indicate IHC-BM may increase BC accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>(3) CD34 is more reliable than CD117 by IHC; however, in combination, they are most reliable and should be performed on BM clots/cores due to variable reactivity </plain></SENT>
