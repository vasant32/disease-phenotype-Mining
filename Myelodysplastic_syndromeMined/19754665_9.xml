<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As for <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> itself, the role of CIN in the evolution and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> is a matter still open to debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated numerical as well as structural CIN in primary CD34-positive cells by determining the cell-to-cell variability of the chromosome content using fluorescence-in situ-hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereby, CIN was measured in 65 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, a subgroup with elevated levels of CIN was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 17.2 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients within this 'high CIN' subgroup had died or progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, while 80% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CIN levels had stable disease (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, there was no statistically significant difference between '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CIN' and 'high CIN' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients regarding established risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hence, elevated CIN levels were associated with poor outcome, and our method provided additional prognostic information beyond conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients for whom serial measurements were available, development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was preceded by increasing CIN levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, elevated CIN levels may be valuable as an early indicator of poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, hence corroborating the concept of CIN as a driving force in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
