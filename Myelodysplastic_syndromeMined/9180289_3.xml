<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were enrolled in an EORTC study and received low-dose Ara-C with or without growth factors according to the study protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (67%) were characterized by different clonal markers, such as various gene rearrangements (eg Ig-JH, tcR-beta, bcr, GM-CSF, G-CSF or IL-3) and/or chromosomal markers at the time of diagnosis or early in the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 23 of 30 cases that could be studied in the course of the disease, a statement about the clonal situation was possible: in three cases (8%) the clonal situation did not change, in nine cases (39%) at least a transient reduction of clonal cells could be demonstrated, suggesting partial or complete response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In eight cases (35%) a change for the worse could be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four cases (17%) involvement of multiple clones could be demonstrated with the clones exhibiting different susceptibilities to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation showed that patients without clonal markers at diagnosis had a better prognosis as compared to patients who presented with clonal markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that clonality analysis at diagnosis and in the course of the disease will be a useful tool to study the biology and response to treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
