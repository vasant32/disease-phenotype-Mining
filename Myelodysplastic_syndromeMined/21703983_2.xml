<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are aging-associated disorders characterized by ineffective maturation of hematopoietic elements, which are often diagnostically challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study identifies microRNAs (miRNA) and miRNA targets that might represent diagnostic markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study utilized a total of 42 MDS samples and 45 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A discovery set of 20 frozen bone marrow mononuclear cell samples (10 MDS, 10 controls) was profiled on a custom Agilent miRNA microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Classifier miRNAs were validated in a separate set of 49 paraffin-embedded particle preparations by real-time polymerase chain reaction (24 MDS, 25 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Target prediction analysis was compared to a de novo transcriptional profile of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> derived from the Microarray Innovations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>c-Myb and Sufu were further investigated by immunohistochemical stains on a set of 26Â paraffin-embedded samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 13 miRNAs of interest from the discovery set, 8 of which proved statistically significant on real-time polymerase chain reaction verification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These eight miRNAs were then examined in an independent real-time polymerase chain reaction validation set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, hsa-miR-378, hsa-miR-632, and hsa-miR-636 demonstrated particularly high discrimination between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Target prediction identified potential targets of miRNA regulation that correspond to many of the genes that characterize <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining performed on a third validation set confirmed that c-Myb and Sufu are differentially expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data utilize both discovery and validation sets and two complementary platforms to identify miRNAs associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed predicted targets and identified c-Myb and Sufu as potential diagnostic markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
