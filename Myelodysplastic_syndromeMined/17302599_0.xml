<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, as only about 30% of recipients have an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> for this potentially curative approach, the use of family donors with one or two mismatches in the HLA-antigens (mismatch related donor, MMRD) or fully matched unrelated donors (MUD) (''alternative donors'') has been introduced in the allogeneic SCT setting in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the feasibility of allogeneic SCT from alternative donors by using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) we initiated a prospective, phase II study in 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From April 1996 to July 1998, 18 patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> underwent allogeneic SCT from alternative donors (two patients with MUD and 16 patients with MMRD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received stable engraftment and none of the patients had graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of aGvHD (grades II-IV) and the relapse rate at last follow-up (seven to nine yr after SCT) were with 40% and 24%, respectively, comparable with those found in patients receiving allogeneic SCT from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, five yr after allogeneic SCT only 17% were alive, which was mainly due to the treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate of 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that allogeneic PBSC transplantation by using alternative donors is associated with an unsatisfying long-term TRM rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significance of TRM and particular late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> has to be evaluated further in this transplantation setting </plain></SENT>
