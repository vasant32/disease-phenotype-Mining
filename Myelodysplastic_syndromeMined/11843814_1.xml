<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the t(6;9) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> is commonly associated with bone marrow basophilia, the cytological characteristics of leukaemic cells are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we examined the in vitro effects of several cytokines on growth and differentiation of t(6;9) leukaemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells from four patients with t(6;9) (two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) were cultured for 14 d in the presence or absence of each cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of culture, viable cells were counted, and their histology was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells obtained from 22 patients (10 AML, six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) lacking t(6;9) were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with control cultures, significantly higher numbers of blasts appeared in the culture of bone marrow cells from t(6;9)-positive patients in response to stimulation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) or interleukin 3 (IL-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stem cell factor (SCF) had little effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil counts were also significantly increased in the presence of G-CSF or IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SCF and IL-3 were potent in increasing basophil counts from t(6;9)-positive cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that bone marrow cells obtained from t(6;9) patients are highly sensitive to growth- and/or differentiation-promoting cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Special attention should be paid to the use of "therapeutic" cytokines in these patients </plain></SENT>
