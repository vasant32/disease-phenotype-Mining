<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We hypothesized that surrogate markers of host immune response may predict survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of immediate practical applicability, we chose plasma immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) concentration as the biomarker of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two independent cohorts of patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (PMF) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) FLCs were measured by a quantitative nephelometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with monoclonal FLC were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Values that were above the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for κ or λ FLC were documented in 33% of 240 patients with PMF and 46% of 74 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased FLC was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>increased creatinine</z:hpo>, and advanced age in PMF (P &lt; .001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> less than 10 g/dL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, increased FLC predicted shortened survival in both PMF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, independent of age, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and other conventional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cutoff levels based on receiver operating characteristic analysis for κ plus λ total FLCs delineated risk groups with highly significant differences in overall survival; International Prognostic Scoring System-adjusted hazard ratio in PMF was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7), and was 6.3 (95% CI, 2.7 to 16.6) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlations were seen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival, karyotype, or JAK2, MPL, or IDH mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with PMF who were studied by cytokine profiling, the prognostic value of an increased FLC level was independent of that from circulating interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) or IL-8 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased plasma FLC concentration predicts inferior survival in both PMF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Its lack of correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific genetic markers suggests a primarily host-driven biologic phenomenon that might be more broadly applicable </plain></SENT>
