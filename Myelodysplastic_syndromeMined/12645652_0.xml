<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a young female patient presenting with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), a unique clone involving six structural chromosome rearrangements was identified using G-banding and molecular cytogenetic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty GTG-banded metaphases from bone marrow were initially analyzed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases contained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the six structural chromosome rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further define the GTG-banded karyotype, a series of fluorescence in situ hybridization and primed in situ labeling experiments were performed and the karyotype was then characterized as: 46,XX,r(5)(p13q13),der(20)t(5;20),dup(11)(p11.2p15), r(11)(p15q25),del(13)(q14),idic(22)(p11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient quickly progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> three months after the diagnosis and died of a <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the brain parenchyma two months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this case, the multiple structural chromosome rearrangements conferred an obvious cellular proliferative advantage and indicated a very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considering that multiple chromosome abnormalities associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> transformation are often polyclonal, this unique clone involving six structural chromosome rearrangements make our case highly unusual </plain></SENT>
