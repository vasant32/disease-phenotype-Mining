<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is the first agent approved for use in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) based on its improvement in overall survival as monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence of efficacy in combination with other agents is also accumulating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas covered: Key information on mechanisms of action is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Development, synthesis, and pharmacokinetics are also outlined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Key safety, tolerability, and efficacy data from clinical trials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> as monotherapy as well as in combination are also presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expert opinion: Our understanding of the molecular basis and pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> continues to evolve rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-Azacytidine</z:chebi> has been shown to improve both overall survival and quality of life in patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Currently, the oral route of administration is undergoing evaluation in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Used as a monotherapy and also in novel combinations, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> has the potential to further improve the prognosis of some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
