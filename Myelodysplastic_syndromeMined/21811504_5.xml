<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the recent years, the discovery of a series of mutations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> has provided insight into the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs), myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (MPNs), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these alterations have been mutations in genes, such as IDH1/2, TET2, DNMT3A, and EZH2, which appear to affect DNA and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> lysine methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large clinical correlative studies are beginning to decipher the clinical importance, prevalence, and potential prognostic significance of these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, burgeoning insight into the role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> has prompted increased interest in development of novel therapies which target DNA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> posttranslational modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA demethylating agents have been demonstrated to be clinically active in a subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and are used extensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, newer, more specific agents which alter DNA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification are under preclinical study and development and are likely to expand our therapeutic options for these diseases in the near future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we review the current understanding of the clinical importance of these newly discovered mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also discuss exciting developments in DNA methyltransferase inhibitor strategies and the prospect of novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> lysine methyltransferase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
