<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We conducted a randomized Phase II trial to directly compare toxicity, feasibility, and delivered dose intensities of two adjuvant dose-intensive regimens containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, paclitaxel, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> for patients with node-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-two patients with resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> involving one or more ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, were randomized to receive two different schedules of adjuvant chemotherapy using 14-day dosing intervals: either (a) three cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> 80 mg/m(2) as i.v. bolus followed sequentially by three cycles of paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) as a 24-h infusion and then by three cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 3.0 g/m(2) as a 1-h infusion (arm A); or (b) the same schedule of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> followed by three cycles of concurrent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and paclitaxel at the same doses (arm B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cycles were supported by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one patients were assessable for toxicity and feasibility; 37 (90%) completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> planned chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no treatment-related mortality; however, increased toxicity was observed on arm B compared with arm A, manifested by an increase in hospitalization for toxicity, mainly neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and an increased incidence of transfusion of packed RBCs transfusions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean delivered dose intensities for paclitaxel and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> were significantly greater for arm A compared with arm B (P =.01 and P =.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is no long-term, treatment-related toxicity, and no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> have been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dose-dense sequential single-agent chemotherapy is more feasible than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> with subsequent concurrent paclitaxel and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
