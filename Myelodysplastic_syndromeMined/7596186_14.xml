<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These three groups have been categorized together and have been associated with high complete remission (CR) and survival rates following Ara-C-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed the 63 AML or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with an abnormality of chromosome 16 treated at MD Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center (MDACC) over the past 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marked differences in survival and remission duration (RD) were noted between the inv(16) or t(16;16) patients and those with del(16q), whose outcome was no better than other M4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients treated during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other differences characterizing del(16q) included a lack of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> relapses, lower incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and M4 FAB subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Half the inv(16) patients had additional karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall survival and remission duration for those patients were no different from those for patients with inv(16) alone, although the probability of remaining in first CR at 2 years was higher in the inv(16) alone group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in overall survival for the 45 patients who received HDAC vs those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> relapse was, however, markedly reduced for the HDAC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>Eosinophilia</z:hpo> did not correlate with improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that del(16q) confers a different prognosis from inv(16) and t(16;16) and for the purposes of prognostication or treatment recommendations should no longer be categorized with them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional karyotypic changes however, which accompany inv(16) in 50% of cases do not influence the overall outcome compared to patients with inv(16) alone </plain></SENT>
