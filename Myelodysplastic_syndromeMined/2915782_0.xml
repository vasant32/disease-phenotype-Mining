<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we determined the serum EPO levels in 100 healthy volunteers and in over 300 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hyperglobulinemia</z:hpo> of various causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the healthy group, the females had levels of 11.3 +/- 3.4 mU/ml, while the males had levels of 8 +/- 3.2 mU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum EPO concentrations were inversely related to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in patients with nonrenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo>, while predialysis patients with renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> showed only partially such a tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemodialysis patients exhibited EPO-levels that were inadequately low relative to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hyperglobulinemia</z:hpo> had significantly higher serum EPO-levels than healthy individuals and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera patients, the latter having particularly low serum EPO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the determination of serum EPO levels can be of value in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hyperglobulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, sequential measurements document fluctuating serum EPO-levels after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal hemorrhages</z:hpo> and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemias</z:hpo> receiving iron substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probable reason for this phenomenon seems to be the intermittent utilisation of the hormone by EPO-sensitive erythropoietic precursor cells </plain></SENT>
