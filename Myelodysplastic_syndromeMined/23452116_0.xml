<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract This study introduces an in-depth flow cytometric method for the analysis of nucleated erythroid progenitors during bone marrow regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial immunophenotypic analysis with the conventional erythroid-associated markers CD36, CD71, and CD235a was supplemented with the analysis of additional markers, including CD105, CD117, CD45, CD38, and cell-scattered light characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the expression of CD105 and CD117 is critical for the distinction between 4 phenotypically different developmental stages of nucleated erythroid progenitors: pro-erythroblasts, basophilic erythroblasts, polychromatophilic erythroblasts, and orthochromatophilic erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD105 antigen expression was specifically associated with pro-erythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts, whereas CD117 was expressed at the earliest pro-erythroblast stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both antigens were progressively lost throughout the course of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data allow for the identification of aberrant erythroid development in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_337'>erythroid leukaemia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
