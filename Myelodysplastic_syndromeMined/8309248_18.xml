<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine phosphorylation is an important regulator of cell growth and differentiation reflecting the interaction of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although excessive PTK activity can result in hematopoietic cell transformation, perturbation of either of these two modulators may result in uncontrolled cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myeloid cells are responsive to growth factors and cytokines that induce tyrosine phosphorylation and can become ligand independent when endogenous PTKs become dysregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTPs</z:chebi>, through mutation or altered expression, may enhance PTK activities and also cause myeloid ligand independence, though this has not yet been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported the isolation of a hematopoietic specific cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> (HePTP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We now report that this gene maps to chromosome 1q32.1 utilizing fluorescent in situ chromosomal hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This site is frequently amplified in preleukemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> characterized by myeloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> reveals triplication of the HePTP gene on one allele with elevated protein expression in neoplastic myelomonocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated expression is also identified in blasts from some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations prompted us to examine the experimental effects on cell growth of HePTP overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Though <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myeloid cells show minimal HePTP expression, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematopoietic cell lines tested show high expression of HePTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gene transfer of HePTP into NIH 3T3 cells was therefore performed, which caused altered cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, disorganized growth, anchorage independent colony formation and subtle differences in the pattern of tyrosine phosphoproteins compared to control cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that amplification and overexpression of HePTP may be an important cofactor contributing to abnormal myeloid cell growth </plain></SENT>
