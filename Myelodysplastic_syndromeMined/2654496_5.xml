<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic progenitor cell growth was markedly impaired in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p less than 0.05, at least) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recombinant HuGM-CSF supported the growth of CFU-GEMM, CFU-Mk, and BFU-E at lower, equivalent, or slightly higher frequencies that those found in cultures plated with medium conditioned by peripheral blood leukocytes (PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>), but it was invariably ineffective in improving growth values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombinant HuGM-CSF supported the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colonies in 15 of 16 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) of CFU-GM in cultures containing rHuGM-CSF (5 ng/ml) was significantly higher than the one found in cultures stimulated with PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> (40 +/- 15 vs. 17 +/- 7, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon culture with rHuGM-CSF (5 ng/ml), in 5 of 15 patients de novo colony formation was observed (8 +/- 4) and in 4 of 15 patients CFU-GM growth (129 +/- 33) fell within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Doses of rHuGM-CSF higher than 5 ng/ml did not result in a further increase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-derived colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that rHuGM-CSF (a) does not improve the growth of CFU-GEMM, CFU-Mk, and BFU-E; (b) may completely restore the growth of CFU-GM in a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients; (c) while ineffective in improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, its in vivo in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> through an effect at the level of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cell compartment, at least in a subset of highly responsive patients </plain></SENT>
