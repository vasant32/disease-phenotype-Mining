<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have shown that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), who showed increasing mixed chimaerism (MC) upon serial PCR analysis after transplant, have a significantly increased risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the increasing MC in these patients is caused by the reappearance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> recipient haematopoiesis or by the reoccurrence of malignant cells, we purified different leucocyte subpopulations and analysed these subfractions with regard to their donor-recipient ratio by a PCR-based method for the analysis of minisatellite DNA regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients [eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL), three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>] subfractions were analysed when increasing MC was first noted upon serial analysis of the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In seven of these 14 patients (four ALL, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), subfractions were characterized at the time of frank haematological relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients investigated with increasing MC, recipient cells were detected in different mononuclear cell subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients characterized during frank relapse, two distinct distribution patterns were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who relapsed before day +300 (one ALL, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) showed recipient-derived (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) cells in addition to blast populations in different mononuclear subsets as well as granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> who relapsed after day +300 (two ALL and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), only leukaemic cells were found that were of recipient origin, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other haematopoietic cell lines were donor derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show that persistent MC in the early post-transplant period is caused predominantly by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> recipient haematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding further supports the hypothesis that a state of mixed haematopoietic chimaerism may reduce the clinical graft-versus-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (GVL) effect of alloreactive donor-derived effector cells in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and thus facilitate the proliferation of residual malignant cells that may have survived the preparative regimen </plain></SENT>
