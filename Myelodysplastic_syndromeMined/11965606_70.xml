<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients with somatostatin receptor-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were treated with multiple doses of [(111)In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30629">diethylenetriamine</z:chebi> pentaacetic acid(0)]octreotide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty patients were evaluable after cumulative doses of at least 20 GBq up to 160 GBq </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic effects were seen in 21 patients: partial remission in 1 patient, minor remissions in 6 patients, and stabilization of previously progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results thus underscore the therapeutic potential of Auger-emitting radiolabelled <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The toxicity was generally mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow toxicity</z:e>, but 3 of the 6 patients who received more than 100 GBq developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we consider 100 GBq as the maximal tolerable dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a renal radiation dose of 0.45 mGy/MBq (based on previous studies) a cumulative dose of 100 GBq [(111)In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>(0)]octreotide will lead to 45Gy on the kidneys, twice the accepted limit for external beam radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, or significant changes in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance were observed in our patients including 2 patients who received 106 and 113 GBq [(111)In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>(0)]octreotide without protection with amino acids, over a follow-up period of respectively 3 and 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings show that the radiation of the short-range (maximal 10 microns) Auger electrons originating from the cells of the proximal tubules is not harmful for the renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decrease in serum inhibin B and concomitant increase of serum FSH levels in men indicate that the spermatogenesis was impaired </plain></SENT>
