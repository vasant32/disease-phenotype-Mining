<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonal abnormalities were demonstrated in 85% of the patients, with a lower incidence in the RA+ group (refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts) compared to the others (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients a spontaneous progression in cytogenetic aberrations occurred and in 7 of these (60%) a simultaneous progression in FAB-subtype was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The appearance of MPO-deficient PMNs was observed in 6 of these patients (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A progression in FAB-subtype was noted in further 4 patients and 2 additional patients developed MPO-deficient PMNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one sufficient cytogenetic investigation was available in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus 100% of the fully studied patients showed progression in cytogenetic abnormalities when a progression in FAB-subtype or a development of MPO-deficient PMNs was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 (49%) of the 8 patients developing MPO-deficient PMNs too showed a progression in FAB-subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although no significant correlation to specific categories of structural aberrations or abnormalities in specific chromosome pairs could be demonstrated, clonal cytogenetic aberrations seem to be involved when the disease progresses and when MPO-deficient PMN develop </plain></SENT>
