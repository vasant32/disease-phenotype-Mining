<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that telomere fluorescence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> granulocytes, and CD34+ cells did not decline with age as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> granulocytes and CD34+ cells had significantly shorter telomeres than healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant higher incidence of cases with intermediate-unfavourable cytogenetics and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) int-2/high-risk group was observed among patients with lower telomere fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also found that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in CD34+ cells was significantly higher in IPSS int-1 low-risk patients when compared with IPSS int-2 high-risk cases and healthy controls and that CD34+ cell telomere fluorescence directly correlated with CD34+ cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced telomere fluorescence was associated with a history of occupational exposure to toxic agents and with worse survival in univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that flow-cytometry assessment of telomere dynamics may represent a valuable tool in the biological and clinical-prognostic characterisation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> disorders </plain></SENT>
