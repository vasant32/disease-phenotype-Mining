<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that "the Ly/Mbl CD45 ratio (mean fluorescence intensity [MFI] of CD45 on lymphocytes/MFI of CD45 on CD34+ myeloblasts)," "the percentage of CD34+ myeloblasts among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nucleated cells," and "the percentage of CD34+ B-cell precursors among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD34+ cells" had little interexaminer variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These parameters can be analyzed from one test tube for three-color FCM, and their analysis in combination can diagnose a certain percentage of low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
