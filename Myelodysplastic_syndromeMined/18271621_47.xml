<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide is an effective new agent for the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), an acquired hematopoietic disorder characterized by ineffective blood cell production and a predisposition to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with an interstitial deletion of Chromosome 5q have a high rate of response to lenalidomide, but most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients lack this deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% of patients without 5q deletions also benefit from lenalidomide therapy, but response in these patients cannot be predicted by any currently available diagnostic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a method to predict lenalidomide response in order to avoid unnecessary toxicity in patients unlikely to benefit from treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using gene expression profiling, we identified a molecular signature that predicts lenalidomide response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signature was defined in a set of 16 pretreatment bone marrow aspirates from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients without 5q deletions, and validated in an independent set of 26 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response signature consisted of a cohesive set of erythroid-specific genes with decreased expression in responders, suggesting that a defect in erythroid differentiation underlies lenalidomide response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this observation, treatment with lenalidomide promoted erythroid differentiation of primary hematopoietic progenitor cells grown in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate that lenalidomide-responsive patients have a defect in erythroid differentiation, and suggest a strategy for a clinical test to predict patients most likely to respond to the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The experiments further suggest that the efficacy of lenalidomide, whose mechanism of action in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is unknown, may be due to its ability to induce erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
