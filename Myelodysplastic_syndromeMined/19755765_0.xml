<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to determine the predictive factors of response and survival in diseases treated with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine patients who had been diagnosed of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and had undergone chemotherapy between April 2001 and March 2008 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 29 patients, 21 patients had an abnormal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, 13 had complex type abnormalities and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients were administered a low-dose AraC containing regimen and 5 received an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-like regimen as the initial chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The responses were CR4/PR2/NR23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response rate (RR) in the patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype was significantly better than in those with an abnormal karyotype (62.5% vs. 4.8%, p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses showed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level and cytogenetic abnormalities were factors that contributed to the overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype tended to have a better response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level and cytogenetic abnormalities were significant factors affecting the overall survival </plain></SENT>
