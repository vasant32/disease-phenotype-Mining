<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We studied neurological manifestations of the disease, common associated disorders, and their relation with extent of bony malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated neurological manifestations of 50 patients with sacral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated for previous procedures, ambulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002813'>limb abnormalities</z:hpo>, vertebral alignment, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, dribbling, dimple, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007340'>lower extremities weakness</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009929'>myelomeningocele</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>), and lipomyelomenangocele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>Weakness</z:mp> of lower extremities was seen in 37 (74%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of proximal and distal muscles of the lower limb was statistically associated with a type of bony <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> was seen in only 2 of 44 children over the age of 1, and the rest could walk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were seen in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sacral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> is diagnosed in children with concomitant <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> at younger ages and reveals more severe symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> was seen in 19 patients, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom MRI showed tethering of the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Urinary disorders including diurnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> (in 30 of 35 children over age 4) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>recurrent urinary tract infections</z:hpo> (in 37) were also common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003130'>Imperforate anus</z:mp> was seen in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twelve children over age 4 reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002607'>fecal incontinence</z:hpo>, a problem that had statistically significant association with <z:mp ids='MP_0003130'>imperforate anus</z:mp> (P = .013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Different disorders can concurrently affect patients with sacral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> that may have profound impressions on patients and their families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis, thorough evaluation, and proper intervention are of utmost importance as they can prevent or lessen future complications </plain></SENT>
