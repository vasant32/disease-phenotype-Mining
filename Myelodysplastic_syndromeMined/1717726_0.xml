<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were treated with a glycosylated recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF) for improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rG-CSF was administrated intravenously at a dose of 5 micrograms/kg/day for 14 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of patients responded to rG-CSF and an approximately 10 fold increase of the peak neutrophil counts was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neutrophil counts were maintained at high level during the treatment period and returned to pretreatment levels several days after stopping rG-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the recovery of neutrophil, infectious complications improved in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effects of rG-CSF were confined to neutrophils, sparing blast cells and other blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eruption was observed in one patient as toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that rG-CSF therapy is effective in improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
