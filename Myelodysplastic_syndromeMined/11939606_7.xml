<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> evolving from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (sAML), 12 to 62 years old (median, 40 years), were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (7 mg/kg) and TBI (6 x 200 cGy) (BU/TBI) and received transplants from related (n = 20) or unrelated donors (n = 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By French-American-British (FAB) criteria, 21 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 16 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>), 15 had sAML, and 8 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) criteria, 1 patient had low, 10 had intermediate-1, 13 had intermediate-2, and 31 had high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (5 patients had proliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> evaluable patients achieved sustained engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence (CI) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD grades II to IV was 83% with unrelated donors and 85% with related donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CI of relapse was 25% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days was 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 26% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were relapse, organ failure, GVHD, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, improved relapse-free survival was associated with good cytogenetic risk (P = .002) and shorter disease duration (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NRM was increased with longer disease duration (P = .0002), positive cytomegalovirus serology (P = .02), and male sex (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Relapse was associated with poor cytogenetic risk (P = .0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, BU/TBI conditioning as used in this trial was associated with relapse rates comparable to those observed with a previously used more intensive regimen combining BU/TBI with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, despite the omission of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, transplantation-related morbidity and mortality were considerable, particularly with transplants from unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future trials should explore the efficacy and tolerability of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens </plain></SENT>
