<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using focused bioinformatics analyses, we found 1175 genes significantly differentially expressed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, requiring a minimum of 39 genes to separately classify these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major GEP differences were demonstrated between healthy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and between several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subgroups: (1) those whose disease remained stable and those who subsequently transformed (tMDS) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>; (2) between del(5q) and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 6-gene "poor risk" signature was defined, which was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> transformation and provided additive prognostic information for International Prognostic Scoring System Intermediate-1 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of genes generating ribosomal proteins and for other signaling pathways was demonstrated in the tMDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of del(5q) with the remaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients showed 1924 differentially expressed genes, with underexpression of 1014 genes, 11 of which were within the 5q31-32 commonly deleted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrated (1) GEPs distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients from healthy and between those with differing clinical outcomes (tMDS vs those whose disease remained stable) and cytogenetics [eg, del(5q)]; and (2) molecular criteria refining prognostic categorization and associated biologic processes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
