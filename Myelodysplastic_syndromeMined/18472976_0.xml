<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), it has been used primarily in the IPSS low- and intermediate-1 risk setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several trials have demonstrated its potential to lead to both erythroid and cytogenetic responses in these disease groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a clinical trial of patients with a del(5q) chromosomal abnormality, lenalidomide treatment resulted in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence in 67% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 45% of patients achieved a complete cytogenetic remission, and 28% achieved a minor cytogenetic remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result was independent of karyotype complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide might also induce long-term remissions in del(5q) patients with an elevated medullary blast count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In non-del(5q) patients, 43% of patients with confirmed low- and intermediate-1 risk achieved transfusion independence or a reduction of at least 50% of pre-treatment RBC transfusion levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse events are common but manageable and include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000989'>pruritus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, and others </plain></SENT>
