<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we demonstrate that C/EBPalpha(-/-) fetal liver (FL) progenitors are hyperproliferative, show decreased differentiation potential, and show increased self-renewal capacity in response to hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are fewer committed bipotential progenitors in C/EBPalpha(-/-) FL, whereas multipotential progenitors are unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HGF-dependent progenitor cell lines can be derived by directly culturing C/EBPalpha(-/-) FL cells in vitro Hyperproliferative spleen colonies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are observed in mice reconstituted with C/EBPalpha(-/-) FL cells, indicating progenitor hyperproliferation in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C/EBPalpha(-/-) FL lacked macrophage progenitors in vitro and had impaired ability to generate macrophages in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings show that C/EBPalpha deficiency results in hyperproliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPCs</z:e> and a block in the ability of multipotential progenitors to differentiate into bipotential granulocyte/macrophage progenitors and their progeny </plain></SENT>
