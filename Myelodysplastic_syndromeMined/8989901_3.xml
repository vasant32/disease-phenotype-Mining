<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, using a recently established flow cytometric method that enables detailed analysis of the cell cycle (Gzero-, G1-, S-, and G2/M-phases) of target cells in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cell population, we examined the effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and other HGFs on the cell cycle of CD13-positive cells (blasts and other malignant myelocytic and monocytic cells) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell cycle response to G-CSF (decrease in Gzero-phase cells and increase in S-phase cells) was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the data for 13 MDS cases and 15 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases were compared statistically, the magnitude of cell cycle activation by G-CSF was weaker for the cells from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stem cell factor, interleukin-3, or a combination of these HGFs with G-CSF reduced the Gzero-phase cell percentage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases whose cell cycle was unresponsive to G-CSF alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> was added to cells with or without stimulation by HGFs, the viable G0-phase cell count was reduced in HGF-stimulated cells compared with unstimulated cells in seven of eight cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that G-CSF-induced cell cycle stimulation of malignant cells can be expected in a fraction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and that even in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients whose cells do not respond to G-CSF, employment of other HGFs and their combination with G-CSF is worth consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest that a well-designed therapy using HGFs and chemotherapeutic drugs may reduce the quiescent (Gzero) cell count in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, which is assumed to be responsible for drug resistance derived from cell kinetics </plain></SENT>
