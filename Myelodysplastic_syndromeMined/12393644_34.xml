<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that T lymphocyte-mediated inhibition of hematopoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) contributes to cytopenia in some patients and can be reversed by treatment with immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the T-cell repertoires of 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> before and after antithymocyte globulin (ATG)-based treatment by T-cell receptor Vbeta (TCR-Vbeta) spectratype analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average number of TCR-Vbeta families with skewed spectratypes, representative of clonal or oligoclonal T-cell populations, was 7.6 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients before treatment and 3.2 in healthy controls (P =.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients who recovered effective hematopoiesis after treatment lost prominent, skewed peaks on their spectratypes, suggesting loss or diminution of overrepresented clonal T-cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients who did not recover effective hematopoiesis showed persistently skewed repertoires 3 to 6 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients with skewed repertoires, cDNA from the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of 4 TCR-Vbeta families was cloned and repetitively sequenced, confirming clonal T-cell dominance in each family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one nonresponder, 16 of 19 CDR3 sequences were identical, demonstrating that 9.3% of the total T-cell population was made up of a single clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By 6 months after treatment, this clone persisted on both spectratype and DNA sequence complementarity and when analyzed by flow cytometry was shown to be CD8(+)/CD45RA(+)/HLA-DR(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T-cell clones were not anergic because they could be expanded 4-fold in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that predominant clonal T cells that appear to be antigen-driven persist in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> unresponsive to immunosuppression, but predominant clones regress in responders to immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
