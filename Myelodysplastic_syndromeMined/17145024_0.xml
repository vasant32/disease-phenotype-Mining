<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single point mutation of JAK2 (Val617Phe) has been detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, ET and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (MF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to investigate the JAK2 mutation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> and to compare the results to those of the endogenous formation of BFU-E erythroid colonies (EEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, different sources of hematopoietic cells to obtain DNA were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: In this work 146 patents were studied (81 MPD: 27 PV, 28 ET, 11 MF and 15 with myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 28 patients showed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemias</z:hpo> or reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, 8 MPD/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and 29 other disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 54 patients, EEC were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood cells were used as source of DNA in 122 patients, bone marrow in 33, cells from BFU-E in 14 and cells from EEC in 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their DNA samples were analyzed using an allele-specific polimerase chain reaction methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The JAK2 mutation was present in 96% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> patients, 59% of ET and 63.6% of MF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the remaining patients showed this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic agreement was excellent between EEC and the mutation (kappa index = 0.93; 97% positive agreement and 95% negative agreement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DNA was obtained in 119 out of 122 samples from peripheral blood, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with bone marrow, and in 50% of patients with BFU-E or EEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 7 cases, samples from different cell sources were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Their results were identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The V617F mutation of JAK2 is present in most of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> patients and half of those with MF or ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There is an excellent concordance with the EEC results </plain></SENT>
