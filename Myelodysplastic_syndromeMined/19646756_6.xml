<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a retrospective analysis of 137 patients with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without excess of blasts that revealed transfusion dependency in 87% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in overall survival was noted between patients receiving &lt;or=2 units and those receiving &gt;2 units of RBC transfusions/month (65.0 vs. 35.3 months, respectively, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariate statistical analysis identified the presence of disease progression to advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (chi(2)=26.4, P=0.001) and the administration of &gt;1 or &gt;2 units of RBC per month (chi(2)=15.9 and 14.6, respectively, P=0.001) as the most important parameters affecting survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, even the administration of 1 RBC unit every 4-8 weeks had a significantly adverse impact on survival compared to non-transfused patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfusion dependency itself did not affect disease progression as determined by the presence of multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and adverse karyotype (expressed by the IM-1 or IM-2 score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed disease progression towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> as a highly significant independent variable affecting survival (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the other evaluated parameters had a significant impact on survival in patients with progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In non-transplanted patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression, administration of &gt;2 units of RBC transfusions/month was the only independent variable with adverse impact on survival in patients with unilineage erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, only heavy transfusion dependency (&gt;3TURBC/month) and serum ferritin &gt;2000 microg/l adversely affected survival (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Modification of the WPSS by replacing transfusion dependency with initial Hb level &lt;80 g/l retained its prognostic relevance and allowed the identification of a potential risk subset of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with intermediate and high scores and limited survival (&lt;40% at 5 years) as early as at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm a significant negative impact of transfusion dependency on survival in patients with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without excess of blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The main risk subgroup is characterized by unilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> limited to erythropoiesis in combination with dependency on &gt;2TU of RBC per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patients usually have prolonged survival that leads to the development of heavy transfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> and they thus represent the most important target group for intensive chelation therapy </plain></SENT>
