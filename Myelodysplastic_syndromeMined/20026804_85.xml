<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In a phase III randomized trial, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) compared with conventional care regimens (CCRs) in patients with intermediate-2- and high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately one third of these patients were classified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) under current WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis compared the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> versus CCR on OS in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> 75 mg/m(2)/d or CCR (best supportive care [BSC] only, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (LDAC), or intensive chemotherapy [IC]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 113 elderly patients (median age, 70 years) randomly assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> (n = 55) or CCR (n = 58; 47% BSC, 34% LDAC, 19% IC), 86% were considered unfit for IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 20.1 months, median OS for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>-treated patients was 24.5 months compared with 16.0 months for CCR-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.79; P = .005), and 2-year OS rates were 50% and 16%, respectively (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-year OS rates were higher with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> versus CCR in patients considered unfit for IC (P = .0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> was associated with fewer total days in hospital (P &lt; .0001) than CCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In older adult patients with low marrow blast count (20% to 30%) WHO-defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> significantly prolongs OS and significantly improves several patient morbidity measures compared with CCR </plain></SENT>
