<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He investigated the importance of changes of several conventional erythrokinetic parameters as well as the turnover of transferrin molecules which is an indicator of erythropoietic activity independent on sideraemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The author presents ferrokinetic and erythrokinetic findings associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, as described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> produces a typical picture during examination of the erythrokinetics, quite different from other sub-types of the disease in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> the changes of parameters are very variable </plain></SENT>
