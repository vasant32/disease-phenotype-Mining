<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment schedule consisted of three 14-day-cycles of 250 micrograms/m2 rhGM-CSF and 20 mg/m2 ara-C given daily s.c. with four-week treatment-free intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four evaluable patients the percentage of bone marrow blast cells decreased significantly with an increase in the mature myeloid cells but without bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Toxic side effects attributable to the drugs were minor with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itching</z:e> at the site of subcutaneous injection of rhGM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the combined therapy of rhGM-CSF and low-dose ara-C appears to be effective in the short-term control of the leukemic cell population </plain></SENT>
