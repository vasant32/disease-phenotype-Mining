<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The natural history of these disorders is variable and ranges from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> to a rapid course towards leukaemic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Certain shortcomings have been encountered in the French-American-British (FAB) classification over the years, and therefore there is a need for an alternative method of classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1999, the WHO published a revised classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have analysed the clinical, haematological and histomorphological features in 96 cases of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> seen in the department of haematology at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) over a 6-yr period (1996-2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both FAB and WHO classifications have been incorporated and the Bournemouth scoring system applied in each case at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Bournemouth scoring system, in the absence of a cytogenetic study, offers a good prognostication and long-term survival estimate </plain></SENT>
