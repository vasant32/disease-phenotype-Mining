<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At presentation, one patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) with partial 7-<z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> and was reclassified into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> "in transformation" thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another case was diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> with complete 7-<z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other case was diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> "in transformation" without chromosome aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic studies of the patients with 7-<z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> revealed abnormal karyotypes on bone marrow cells, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes on peripheral blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymorphonuclear cells from the two patients with 7-<z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> revealed reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> malate dehydrogenase activity, but those from the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> "in transformation" without chromosome aberrations did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase activity, having been defined as located on chromosome 2, was within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in those three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enzyme activity in the two patients with 7-<z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> would be a dosage effect of the chromosome aberration, but not caused by their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enzyme activity in the patients with 7-<z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> was reduced in polymorphonuclear cells, but not in mononuclear cells in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This fact would indicate that such chromosome evolution had involved myeloid cells only, but not lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both enzymes from leukemic cells of four patients with active disease revealed much higher activities than controls, an expression of partially enhanced oxidative phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
