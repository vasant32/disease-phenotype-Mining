<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> combined with low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> in untreated patients aged &gt;or=60 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a phase 1/2 design, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg on Days 1 through 5 and on Days 8 through 12, and low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> was given subcutaneously twice daily on Days 1 through 14 in escalating doses to a target of 10 mg/m(2) per dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 64 patients who had pathologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, excluding patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and using World Health Organization criteria, the median age was 71 years, 10 patients (16%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e>, 40 patients (63%) had an antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, and 35 patients (55%) had unfavorable cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (53%) had an Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status of 2 or 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission was achieved in 21 of 61 patients (34%), including 15 of 50 patients (30%) who had secondary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1336735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">treatment-related AML</z:e>, 10 of 33 patients (30%) who had unfavorable cytogenetics, and 6 of 34 patients (18%) who had a poor baseline performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate within the first 4 weeks was 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> was observed in &gt;80% of patients, and 41% of patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonhematologic toxicity generally was mild and reversible and included <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>elevated transaminases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
