<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its mechanism of action is not fully understood, nor the reason for its narrow therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the pharmacodynamics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> in an in vitro cell line model, allowing us to evaluate the effects of various doses and exposure times on clonogeneic capacity, proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells were incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> in concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 microg/ml for 2, 4 or 8 h, then washed and cultured in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>-free medium for 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was estimated by using the trapezoidal rule from different concentrations and times of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assays <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> affected the cells in an AUC-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induced changes in the biological parameters studied appeared at different time points after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the decrease in proliferation and clonogenic capacity preceded cell cycle arrest in G2 phase and development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, implying that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is a secondary event to interruption of vital metabolic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biochemically, apoptotic changes were typical for chemotherapy-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with caspase activation, cleavage of Bcl-2 and PARP proteins, while cleavage of actin was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cells were rescued from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with a general caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk, but not with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results add new information about <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> pharmacodynamics and mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of the drug </plain></SENT>
