<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha was correlated with TGF-beta (P = .001) and with monocyte/macrophage cells (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with excess blasts in their marrows had a higher TGF-beta level (P = .01) and monocyte/macrophage number (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a linear regression model,TGF-beta emerged as the most significant biological difference between patients who have excess of blasts and those who do not (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in addition to TNF-alpha, TGF-beta also plays a significant role in the initiation and pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and that a more precise definition of its role will likely identify better preventive and therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
