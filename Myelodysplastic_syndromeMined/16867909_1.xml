<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that reducing the dosage of prophylaxis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) would reduce the risk of relapse and toxicity after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prospective phase II trial, 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> underwent BMT from HLA-identical siblings and received GVHD prophylaxis consisting of low-dose (1.5 mg/kg per day) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSP) with short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This low-dose group was compared with a group of retrospective control patients (n = 22) who received a standard CSP dosage (3.0 mg/kg per day) and MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient died of transplantation-related causes within 100 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The regimen-related toxicity was quite tolerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD of grades II to III was more frequent in the low-dose group (47.6%) than in the control group (22.7%), the increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD did not significantly contribute to morbidity or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the groups in the incidence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of relapse and survival of the groups were similar according to the risk for relapse at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A prospective randomized study is required to determine whether low-dose or standard-dose CSP in combination with MTX is optimal for Japanese patients who undergo allogeneic BMT from HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
