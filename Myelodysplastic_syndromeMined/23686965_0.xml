<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to identify new translocations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and to establish their frequency in a cohort of 8,016 patients from the Spanish Group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was evaluable in 5,654 (70%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among those, 2,014 (36%) had chromosomal abnormalities, including 213 (10%) translocations identified in 195 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The translocations were balanced in 183 (86%) cases and unbalanced in 30 (14%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> chromosomes were found to be involved in translocations, with the single exception of the Y chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes most frequently involved were in decreasing frequency: 3, 1, 7, 2, 11, 5, 12, 6, and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Translocations were found in karyotypes as the unique chromosomal abnormality (33%), associated with another chromosomal abnormality (11%), as a part of a complex karyotype (17%), and as a part of a monosomal karyotype (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 155 translocations not previously described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and nine of them appeared to be recurrent.
