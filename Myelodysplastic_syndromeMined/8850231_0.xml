<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>Myelofibrosis</z:hpo> is a common, poor-prognosis feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to evaluate quantitatively the extent of the juxtatrabecular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasias</z:hpo>, along with the presence of immature precursor cells in anomalous position, that is, the displacement of granulopoiesis from the paratrabecular area to central positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven bone marrow samples were examined: 9 from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 9 from secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasias</z:hpo>, and 9 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of myeloblasts and promyelocytes with nucleoli located in the central areas was estimated, in an attempt to correlate such feature with the degree of juxtatrabecular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of data was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test, values of p &lt; 0.01 being significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sectorial juxtatrabecular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the myelodysplastic samples, ranging from 6% to 55% of the trabecular surface; the highest values found in the controls were about 3.6% (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the juxtatrabecular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> figures are higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>, the difference is not significant with regard to the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the number of patients studied here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The count of myeloblasts and promyelocytes with nucleoli present in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was significantly greater than that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of promyelocytes with nucleoli was significantly higher in the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with respect to the secondary ones, whereas no significant difference was seen between the two types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> regarding the myeloblast count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increased number of central immature precursor cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was not directly correlated with the extent of the juxtatrabecular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the number of cases is small, the fact that the juxtatrabecular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was higher in the two deceased patients in the series (49% and 56%, respectively) suggests a poor-risk prognosis for such finding </plain></SENT>
