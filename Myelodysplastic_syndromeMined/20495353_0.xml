<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells express the myeloid marker CD33, making it amenable to CD33-targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lintuzumab (SGN-33), a humanized monoclonal anti-CD33 antibody undergoing clinical evaluation, induced meaningful responses in a Phase 1 clinical trial and demonstrated anti-leukemic activity in preclinical models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, it was reported that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> (Vidaza(TM)) prolonged the overall survival of a group of high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the combination of lintuzumab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> would be beneficial, a mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> of disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was used to evaluate the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden and an increase in overall survival in mice treated with lintuzumab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects were greater than that obtained with either agent alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the in vivo anti-leukemic activity of lintuzumab was dependent upon the presence of mouse effector cells including macrophages and neutrophils, in vitro effector function assays were used to assess the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> on lintuzumab activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> significantly enhanced the ability of lintuzumab to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell killing through antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytic (ADCP) activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that lintuzumab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> act in concert to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these findings provide the rationale to evaluate this combination in the clinic </plain></SENT>
