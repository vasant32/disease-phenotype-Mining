<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow DNA was compared with corresponding constitutional DNA derived from buccal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apart from BAT26 and BAT40 that were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> (poly A) repeats, the others were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> (CA) repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients comprised 10 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), nine cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEBt), and three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial samples were available in seven patients, in which four showed transformation into higher disease grade or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic alterations at one locus (three at D2S123, one at D4S171) were evident in four cases, and loss of heterozygosity at Tp53 was detected in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, none of the 29 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> nor the seven with disease progression in this study exhibited MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This shows that MSI may not be important in the pathogenesis or progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in contrast to other genetic mechanisms, notably recurrent chromosomal abnormalities that dysregulate the expression or function of genes controlling cell growth, differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
