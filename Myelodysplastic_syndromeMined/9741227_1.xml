<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 28 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were examined, 12 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and 4 with refractory ringed sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, both subgroups of relatively favourable prognosis; 9 patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with blastic excess and 3 with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with blastic excess in transformation, subgroups of unfavourable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined factor B, alternate and classical hemolytic activity, as well as C3 and C4 quantification of the complement system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating immune complexes detection was performed by the C1q deviation test and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> 6000 precipitation method at 3.75% final concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant decrease in C3 level, alternate haemolytic activity and factor B was demonstrated in the unfavourable prognosis subgroups in comparison with patients of favourable prognosis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275522" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclinical infections</z:e> in patients with unfavourable prognosis </plain></SENT>
