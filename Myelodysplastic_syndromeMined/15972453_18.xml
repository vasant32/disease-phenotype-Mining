<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) in French-American-British (FAB) classification cases diagnosed in Japan and Germany to perform a more exact comparison between Asian and Western <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first step, we analyzed agreement of morphologic diagnosis between Japanese and German hematologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood and bone marrow slides of 129 patients diagnosed with FAB-RA, FAB-RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were selected randomly and evaluated separately by each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The agreements of diagnoses according to FAB and World Health Organization (WHO) classifications were 98.4% and 83.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, we compared clinical features between 131 Japanese and 597 German patients with FAB-RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Japanese patients were significantly younger than German patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Japanese patients had more severe cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, prognosis of Japanese patients was significantly more favorable than that of German patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Japanese patients had a significantly lower cumulative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> evolution than did German patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Frequency of WHO-RA in Japanese patients with FAB-RA was significantly higher than that in German patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results indicate that the clinical features of Japanese patients with FAB-RA differ from those of German patients </plain></SENT>
