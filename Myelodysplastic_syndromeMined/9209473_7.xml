<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a 10-year period, 1,143 marrow samples from patients with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were referred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Successful studies were completed on 992 cases (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> referred cases, the rates of detection of cytogenetically abnormal clones were 95% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), 54% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), 51% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL), and 43% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 169 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> studied, 90.5% bore the standard Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), 3.55% had an unusual Ph, and 5.33% were Ph-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 59 cases of cytogenetically abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, common abnormalities observed were <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and changes resulting in loss of material from the long arm of chromosomes 5 and 7, and 20q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 168 abnormal ANLL, there was a strikingly non-random pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 predominating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Common structural changes observed were changes resulting in loss of material from the long arm of chromosomes 5 and 7, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, rearrangements of 11q23, t(15;17), t(8;21), rearrangements of 12q13 and 3q, inversion 16, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11, Ph, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21, t(6;9) and t(1;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences between adult and pediatric findings were minor, with the exception of chromosome 5 abnormalities, which were common among adults with ANLL but rare in the pediatric cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 273 ALLs with abnormal cytogenetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was preferential gain of chromosomes 21, X, 14, 6, 4, 18, 17, and 10 (in decreasing order of frequency) in leukemic clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 193 ALLs with structural changes, many fell into-well-defined categories with established correlations to FAB subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Common changes in ALL were rearrangements of 9p, 12p, 6q, TCR loci, 11q23, Ig loci, and 8q24, and duplication of 1q, Ph, i(17q), t(1;19), i(9q) and dic(9;12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The detailed documentation of the cytogenetic findings in this relatively large, single-institution study will likely facilitate the further characterization of rare, primary cytogenetic changes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>From a managed health care perspective, regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cytogenetic services may be cost-effective alternatives to single-institution laboratories </plain></SENT>
