<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were a total of 57 untreated patients with the B-cell type of either NHL (27 Burkitt's and 9 diffuse large) or ALL between 2 and 15 years old (median: 8 years) seen between 1988 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received the same cytoreductive therapy (half doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) and the same first and second induction courses (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, repetitive high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and adriamycin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three cycles of consolidation blocks A and B (consisting of reduced doses of similar agents used in the second induction course) followed for patients with stage III or IV NHL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, while only one cycle was given for stage I or II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three patients (93.0%) achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 48 months (range: 24-94 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were, respectively, 75.9% (S.E.: 5.9) and 70.1 (S.E.: 6.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relapse-free interval rate of the 53 patients who achieved CR was 83.5% (S.E.: 5.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EFS was 75.0% (S.E.: 21.7) in stage I, 84.6% (S.E.: 10.0) in stage II, 78.63% (S.E.: 11.0) in stage III, 80.0% (S.E.: 17.9) in stage IV, and 52.4% (S.E.: 10.9) in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the stage IV NHL and ALL patients, EFS was significantly worse in patients with initial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement than in those without it (14.3% (S.E.: 13.2) vs. 73.7% (S.E.: 10.1); P = 0.0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our regimen (AT-B88) produced a more than 70% cure-rate for children with any stage of B-cell NHL/ALL without initial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
