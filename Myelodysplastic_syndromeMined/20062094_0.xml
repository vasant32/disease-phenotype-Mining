<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this single-center retrospective study, we report on a total of 92 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n=87) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; n=5), who were treated between 1996 and 2006 with a uniform preparative regimen of BU and CY and peripheral blood-derived HCT from related (n=46) or unrelated donors (n=46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At transplantation, 45 patients were in CR, 11 were untreated and 36 had relapsed or refractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 864 days after transplant (range 24-3798) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 5 years after HCT, cumulative incidences for relapse (32% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM; 17%) were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) and OS rates were 36 and 45% for related and 47 and 57% for unrelated patients, respectively (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> P=0.43; OS P=0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-risk patients with an unfavorable remission status before HCT benefited more from unrelated HCT than related HCT, showing a significantly better 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> of 46% (95% confidence interval (CI) 27-65) vs 22% (95% CI 4-40) (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unrelated HCT benefited high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with an unfavorable remission status better than related HCT </plain></SENT>
