<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3, an increasing number of myeloid cells acquired the morphological appearance of mature monocyte-macrophages and reacted positively to <z:chebi fb="36" ids="17051">fluoride</z:chebi>-sensitive naphthyl <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> esterase and specifically bound My4 monoclonal antibody (McAb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incubation of bone marrow cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis retinoic acid</z:chebi> enhanced the number of cells with the morphological appearance of metamyelocytes and mature granulocytes as well as those that reacted positively with AS-D <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">naphthol</z:chebi> chloroacetate esterase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the differentiation pattern of myeloid precursor cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients can be modulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis retinoic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
