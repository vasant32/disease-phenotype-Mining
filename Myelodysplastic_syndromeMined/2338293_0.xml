<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Technicon H6000 hematology blood counter is a fully automated analyzer which provides, in addition to conventional hematological blood values (i.e. RBC, PLT, etc.), a differential count of WBCs based on a combination of cytochemistry (peroxidase content) and cell volume analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of these characteristics, the H6000 quantitizes, as part of the full differential count, the number and percentage of "large unstained cells" (LUCs), i.e. large peroxidase-negative circulating elements with a cell volume above a predetermined threshold established for the lymphocytes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the H6000 printouts (scattergrams) of 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and of 12 other patients with transient cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most important and constant diagnostic features for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were the increased proportion of LUCs and, in some cases, the high monocyte count, which are both automatically provided by the instrument </plain></SENT>
