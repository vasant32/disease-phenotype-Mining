<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We prospectively assessed autologous stem cell transplantation for consolidation treatment in a trial of intensive chemotherapy in high risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this trial, patients aged 55 years or less with no HLA-identical sibling and achieving CR were scheduled to receive unmanipulated autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) preceded by a consolidation chemotherapy course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two of the 83 patients aged 55 years or less included in the trial (51%) achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three were allografted in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of the remaining 39 patients who achieved CR (62%) received ABMT (16 patients) or autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APSCT) (eight patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, as bone marrow harvest was often insufficient, APSCT was subsequently proposed after mobilization by consolidation chemotherapy followed by G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ABMT and APSCT were performed 1-7 months (median 3) after CR achievement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hematological reconstitution occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and tended to be faster after APSCT than ABMT although not significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients died from the procedure, nine relapsed after 2-26 months and 12 (50%) were still in CR after 8-55 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In autografted patients, median Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival and survival were 29 and 33 months from the autograft, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, ABMT or APSCT can be performed in almost two-thirds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients who achieve CR with intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PBSC collection may yield higher numbers of stem cells than marrow collection in some cases, and could improve the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients autografted in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up is required to determine if autograft will prolong CR duration in at least some patients </plain></SENT>
