<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Polo-like kinase 2 (SNK/PLK2), a transcriptional target for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 and is hypermethylated in a high percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given these data, we sought to study the methylation status of the specific gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and to correlate it with clinical and genetic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using methylation-specific PCR MSP, we analyzed the methylation profile of 45 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 43 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied the distribution of MTHFR A1298C and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms and FLT3 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients and correlated the results with hypermethylation in the SNK/PLK2 CpG island </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SNK/PLK2 CpG island was hypermethylated in 68.9% and 88.4% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with hypermethylation had a trend towards more favorable overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no association between different MTHFR genotypes and susceptibility to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SNK/PLK2 hypermethylation combined with the MTHFR AA1298 genotype was associated with a tendency for a better OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, patients with SNK/PLK2 hypermethylation combined with the MTHFR CT677 polymorphism had a better OS (HR = 0.34; p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SNK/PLK2 methylation associated with unmutated FLT3 cases had a trend for better OS compared to patients with mutated FLT3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SNK/PLK2 is a novel epigenetically regulated gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and methylation occurs at high frequency in both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As such, SNK/PLK2 could represent a potential pathogenetic factor, although additional studies are necessary to verify its exact role in disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
