<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify the genetic recombination mechanism underlying the t(3;21), we molecularly cloned the breakpoints and determined their nucleotide sequence in a case of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in blastic crisis with t(3;21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Near the breakpoint on chromosome 21, three homopyrimidine (CT)-rich sequences were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also identified a sequence homologous to the topoisomerase II binding and cleavage consensus sequence surrounding the breakpoint on chromosome 3, and two topoisomerase II binding and cleavage consensus sequences near the breakpoint on chromosome 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, around the breakpoint on chromosome 21, four chi-like sequences, potential consensus signals for activating recombination, were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no Alu sequences or antigen receptor gene-like heptamer/nonamer signal sequences within the breakpoints on chromosomes 3 and 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints were found adjacent to the topoisomerase II binding and cleavage consensus sequence or the homopyrimidine-rich sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the chi-like sequences and the homopyrimidine-rich sequence were detected on chromosome 21 but not on chromosome 3 </plain></SENT>
