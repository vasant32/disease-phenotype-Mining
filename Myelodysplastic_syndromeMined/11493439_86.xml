<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients stopped therapy before 12 weeks (minimum period for response evaluation), and 51 completed 12 weeks of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>International Working Group response criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were used to evaluate responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis classified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> off-study patients as nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Off-study patients belonged to a higher risk category (P =.002) and had a higher percentage of blasts in their pretherapy bone marrow than patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy (P =.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No cytogenetic or complete responses were seen, but 16 patients showed hematologic improvement, with 10 previously transfusion-dependent patients becoming transfusion independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responders had lower pretherapy blasts (P =.016), a lower duration of pretherapy platelet transfusions (P =.013), and higher pretherapy platelets (P =.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among responders, 9 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA); 5 had RA with ringed sideroblasts; and 2 had RA with excess blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By ITT analysis, 19% of patients (16 of 83) responded, and when only evaluable patients were analyzed, 31% (16 of 51) responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that thalidomide, as a single agent, is effective in improving cytopenias of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, especially those who present without excess blasts </plain></SENT>
