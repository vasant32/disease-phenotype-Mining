<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median interval from initial treatment for the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> to diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was 46 months (range, 12 to 116 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had chromosomal abnormalities resulting in loss of material from the long arm of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, three patients had abnormalities of chromosome 11 band q23, one patient had both classes of abnormalities, three patients had other abnormalities, and one patient had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of 12 patients with chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities had been exposed to an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi>, and two of three patients with 11q23 abnormalities had been exposed to an epipodophyllotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient with both classes of abnormalities had been exposed to both types of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 are common in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292780" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">therapy-related MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proposed relationships between exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 and between exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and abnormalities of 11q23 are supported in this pediatric series </plain></SENT>
