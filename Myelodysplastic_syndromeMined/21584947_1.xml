<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of these manifestations on the natural outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> has to be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a multicenter retrospective study (2002-2009) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> disclosing systemic and/or immune manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> presenting with systemic and/or immune manifestations were compared in terms of survival with 189 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> lacking these features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical picture in these cases consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (13%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (13%), and cutaneous manifestations (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four cases of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> have been reported in our series, and they have a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immune anomalies were recorded in 29% of the cases, and the presence of cryoglobulins was also associated with a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A difference in survival between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with systemic manifestations and patients lacking these manifestations has been observed in the presence of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and/or cryoglobulins </plain></SENT>
