<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a retrospective analysis examining the influence of pre-transplant serum ferritin on transplant outcomes of 99 MDS patients receiving reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median pre-transplant ferritin value was 1992 ng/ml (range: 6-9580 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No patients received iron chelation therapy preceding transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, there was a strong correlation between a higher pre-transplant serum ferritin (&gt;1500 ng/ml) and a significantly inferior 3-year OS (64.6+/-7.5% vs 39.6+/-7.3%, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, pre-transplant serum ferritin did not influence 3-year TRM (20.2+/-7% vs 27.4+/-7%, p=0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related mortality, and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD between cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, a raised serum ferritin (HR: 2.00, 95% CI: 0.97-3.57, p=0.03), and the presence of &gt;5% bone marrow blasts at time of transplantation (HR: 2.14, 95% CI: 0.84-4.58, p=0.06) were independent predictors of an inferior overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, pre-transplant serum ferritin was not a significant predictor of disease-free survival, relapse or TRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared with myeloablative regimens, RIC regimens may attenuate the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> related end-organ toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies incorporating alternative biomarkers of iron metabolism alongside serum ferritin levels are needed to improve our understanding of the significance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
