<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of clinical and prognostic aspects in this subgroup of patients as compared with those of primarily diagnosed MD-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> patients, showed some significant differences in Hb level, platelet count, percentage of immature circulating precursor (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>), bone marrow blastosis and trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median survival for present group of patients was 33 months compared with 20 months for MD-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different prognostic scores were applied for evaluation of risk distribution and relative impact on survival prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest on a possible atypical presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and indicate a careful attention to be addressed to myelodysplastic patients who develop peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp>, who might have a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> variant, with more favourable prognosis and prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we believe this is a further evidence for the arbitrary nature of current classification systems, which definitely exclude <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
