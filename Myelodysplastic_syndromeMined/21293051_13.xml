<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of six cycles of AZA and VPA for 7 days, followed by ATRA for 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients were enrolled (median age, 72 years; 55 AML including 13 relapsed/refractory patients, 10 MDS; 30 unfavorable karyotypes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Best responses included 14 CR and 3 PR (26%), 75% of the responders and 36% of the non-responders achieving an erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) was 12.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Untreated patients had a longer OS than relapsed/refractory patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients who fulfilled the 6 planned cycles, OS did not appear to depend on CR/PR achievement, suggesting that stable disease while on-treatment would be a surrogate for survival with this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During therapy, early platelet response and demethylation of the FZD9, ALOX12, HPN, and CALCA genes were associated with clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, there was no evidence for the restoration of an ATRA-induced differentiation during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic modulation deserves prospective comparisons to conventional care in patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, at least in those presenting previously untreated disease and low blast count </plain></SENT>
