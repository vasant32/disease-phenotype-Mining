<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that the deregulated expression of a variety of growth factors and/or their receptors has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, we aimed to characterize the potential differences in the expression pattern of the two major leptin receptor transcript variants in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) between different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using RT-PCR and Southern blotting, we compared the expression levels of the two major leptin receptors, the longest (OB-R(L)) and the shortest (OB-R(S)) splice variants, in PBMC from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), healthy individuals and two human hematopoietic cell lines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 and K562) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of the OB-R(S) transcript clearly exceeded that of OB-R(L) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and controls and in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells, but this was reversed in the K562 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the expression of the OB-R(L) was significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared to controls and tended to be so in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, while OB-R(S) tended to be higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients compared to controls, but this difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum leptin levels and circulating soluble leptin receptor levels were slightly but not significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These alterations in the expression of the leptin receptor isoforms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients could suggest a potential role of leptin and its signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e>, which requires further examination </plain></SENT>
