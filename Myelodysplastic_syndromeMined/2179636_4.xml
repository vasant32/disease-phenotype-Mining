<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study the therapeutic effect of low-dose aclarubicin (ACR), we carried out comparative treatment of 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> using this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) was achieved in three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t and one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, partial remission was obtained in one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and hematological improvement in one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, prolonged CR for more than 26 months with persistent chromosomal abnormalities was observed in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, which progressed from RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myelosuppression</z:e> caused by low-dose ACR was milder than that caused by low-dose Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro studies indicated that ACR induced differentiation of bone marrow cells from one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these observations, it is suggested that low-dose ACR may be an alternative to low-dose Ara-C for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and that the in vivo effect of ACR may be mediated by the differentiation of abnormal hemopoietic clones </plain></SENT>
