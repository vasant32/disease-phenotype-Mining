<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe herein the clinical courses of two patients with PLI following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One case is a male patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>acute biphenotypic leukemia</z:hpo>, and the other is a female patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases, hyperleukocytosis did not proceed to PLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the former case presented PLI as the initial manifestation of relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and the latter was accompanied with the fungal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of PLI showed diffuse small nodular lesions along peribronchovascular bundle, and diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162679" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemic infiltration</z:e> was made based on pathological findings obtained from transbronchial lung biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens further revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162679" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemic infiltration</z:e> along the lymphatic surrounding the peribronchial or perivascluar regions, which corresponded well with HRCT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, radiological and pathological corroborating assessment was important to reach the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
