<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Fas receptor, Fas ligand (FasL) pathway is a major mechanism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since hematopoietic progenitors can express the Fas receptor, they may be susceptible to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by FasL-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined FasL expression in the BM of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 50), de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; n = 10), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 6), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, FasL expression was increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and was highest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, FasL expression was seen in myeloid blasts, erythroblasts, maturing myeloid cells, megakaryocytes and dysplastic cells, whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, intense expression was seen in the blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FasL expression correlated with the FAB subtype groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and also correlated directly with the percentage of abnormal metaphases on cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FasL expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> BM inhibited the growth of clonogenic hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This inhibition could be blocked by a soluble recombinant FasFc protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, FasL expression in the initial diagnostic BM was higher in patients who were more anemic, correlated directly with red cell transfusion requirements over the subsequent course of the disease, and was predictive of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that FasL expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is of prognostic significance, and suggest that pharmacological blockade of the Fas-FasL pathway may be of clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
