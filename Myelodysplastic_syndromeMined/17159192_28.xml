<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study among women treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> between 1985 and 2001 in French general hospitals, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centers, or clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included 182 AML and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and 534 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> characteristics, type of treatment, and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were compared in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> was increased after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase-II inhibitor</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy (P &lt; 10-16) and was higher for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy than for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy (relative risk [RR] = 15.6; 95% CI, 7.1 to 34.2; and RR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7 to 4.5, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for other treatment components, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> in patients who received radiotherapy was multiplied by 3.9 (95% CI, 1.4 to 10.8) but was not increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support had an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> (RR = 6.3; 95% CI, 1.9 to 21), even when controlling for chemotherapy doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were considered separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This large case-control study demonstrates that the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> is much higher with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy than with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy in a population of women recently treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> must be kept in mind when using this drug to treat diseases other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> or multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, our study suggests the need to monitor the long-term effects of G-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
