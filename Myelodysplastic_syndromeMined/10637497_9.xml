<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi>-receptor gene (HUMARA) has been used for analysis of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern because of a polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) near the 5'-promoter region correlated with XCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We introduce a novel method to analyze XCI pattern, named HUMARA methylation-specific PCR (HUMARA-MSP) assay, which analyzes methylation status of the HUMARA gene by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> modification instead of a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the original MSP method shows whether there is a methylated band or not, our HUMARA-MSP method identifies the patterns of methylated and unmethylated bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because this method identifies either unmethylated or methylated alleles in each PCR tube and shows opposite band patterns dependent on methylation status, we can assess the XCI pattern independently twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method can avoid false results by incomplete enzyme digestion and incomplete <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> modification will not affect the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extremely small quantities of samples, such as hematopoietic colonies, were also available for HUMARA-MSP assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because DNA modified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26709">sodium bisulfite</z:chebi> is also available for assessment of methylation status of other genes by setting specific primers for them, we performed the simultaneous assessment of clonality and aberrant hypermethylation of p15INK4B gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These simultaneous assessments were easily possible and provided much information despite requiring only a small volume of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HUMARA-MSP assay may facilitate the analyses for pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> because of its simplicity, sensitivity and wide applicability </plain></SENT>
