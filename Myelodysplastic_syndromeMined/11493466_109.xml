<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hematopoietic stem cell underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry and the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342 were previously used to identify a distinct subset of murine hematopoietic stem cells, termed the side population (SP), which rapidly expels Hoechst dye and can reconstitute the bone marrow of lethally irradiated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, the prevalence and pathogenic role of SP cells in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such cells were found in the bone marrow of more than 80% of 61 patients and had a predominant CD34(low/-) immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, they carried cytogenetic markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 cases of active disease examined and in 2 out of 5 cases in complete hematological remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> fluorescence emission profiles revealed significantly higher drug efflux from leukemic SP cells than from non-SP cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of 28 SP cell transplants generated overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-like disease in nonobese diabetic--severe combined immunodeficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low but persistent numbers of leukemic SP cells were detected by molecular and immunological assays in half of the remaining mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings indicate that SP cells are frequently involved in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and may be a target for leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also suggest a mechanism by which SP cells could escape the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> drugs and might eventually contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapse </plain></SENT>
