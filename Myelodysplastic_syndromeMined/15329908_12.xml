<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the authors sought to assess the value of FLT3/ITD mutation status as a prognostic genetic marker for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FLT3/ITD mutation status was evaluated by performing DNA polymerase chain reaction assays on 198 bone marrow samples obtained from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aberrant products were sequenced, and GeneScan analysis was performed to measure FLT3/ITD mutant levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients (2.5%)--2 of the 99 patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts and 3 of the 51 patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>--had FLT3/ITD mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FLT3/ITD was not observed in any of the 48 patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (with or without ringed sideroblasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in clinicohematologic characteristics, cytogenetic characteristics, or International Prognostic Scoring System score between the FLT3/ITD-positive group and the FLT3/ITD-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of the 5 patients carrying the FLT3/ITD mutation experienced progression of disease to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), compared with 70 of the 193 patients who did not have FLT3/ITD (P = 0.066) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was more rapid in patients with FLT3/ITD-positive disease than in patients with FLT3/ITD-negative disease (mean +/- standard error, 3.0 +/- 0.5 months vs. 62.8 +/- 5.6 months; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with FLT3/ITD-positive disease also had significantly shorter survival compared with patients who had FLT3/ITD-negative disease (mean +/- standard error, 5.2 +/- 1.4 months vs. 33.7 +/- 3.1 months; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, FLT3/ITD was identified as an independent predictor of reduced time to development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P = 0.0001) and reduced overall survival (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that FLT3/ITD is associated with a high risk of transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and poor survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
