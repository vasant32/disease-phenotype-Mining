<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven transfusions (445 units) of HLA- and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-matched platelets were given and responses to them were, in general, satisfactory in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No major spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentages of platelet transfusion days with a platelet nadir below 20x10(9)/l were 88% for the last 3 random donor platelet transfusions and 39% for the first 3 HLA- and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-matched platelet transfusions, respectively (p=0.009, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It seems that HLA- and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-alloimmunized patients can be successfully supported with HLA- and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-matched platelet concentrates </plain></SENT>
