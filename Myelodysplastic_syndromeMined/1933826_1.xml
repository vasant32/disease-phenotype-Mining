<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For such a purpose, we studied the effects of the recombinant human IL-3 (rhIL-3) on the mitotic index and the karyotype of bone marrow cells from 14 patients with myelodysplastic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and myeloproliferative syndromes (MPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mitotic response to IL-3 of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow samples was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total bone marrow cells were cultured for 24 to 72 hours either in presence or absence of rhIL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most cases, IL-3--stimulated samples showed a considerably higher (4-70 times) mitotic index than unstimulated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although a great patient-to-patient variability was observed, a common pattern of mitogenic response to IL-3 emerged among MPS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 48 hours of incubation, the mean mitotic index from MPS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases stimulated with IL-3 was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than unstimulated controls, whereas the mean mitotic increase from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples did not reach statistical significance (p greater than 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even though not statistically evaluable, a similar trend of response was observed at 24 and 72 hours of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosome studies of MPS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases showed the same karyotype either in stimulated and unstimulated samples </plain></SENT>
