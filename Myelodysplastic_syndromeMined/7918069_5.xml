<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>f-Met-Leu-Phe-stimulated luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence was found to be repeatedly defective in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This defect was not attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398595" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myeloperoxidase deficiency</z:e>, nor to a defect in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase function, because <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> chemiluminescence was found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An arbitrary value of 7 mV (half the mean control value) was chosen to subdivide the group: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with values &lt; 7 mV had a mean f-Met-Leu-Phe chemiluminescence response of 2.5 +/- 0.5 compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with values &gt; 7 mV who had a mean response of 15.6 +/- 1.6 mV, P &lt; 0.01 (healthy controls 14 +/- 2 mV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the f-Met-Leu-Phe receptor and initial calcium flux results suggested that the receptor itself was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in number and function in low f-Met-Leu-Phe responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation, which is calcium-dependent, was also found to be in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in low f-Met-Leu-Phe responders, although total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production was reduced in some of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> neutrophils with a low f-Met-Leu-Phe response were stimulated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, chemiluminescence was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, suggesting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activity of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-oxidase complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, myeloperoxidase activity was reduced in only three out of the 11 low f-Met-Leu-Phe responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following priming with GM-CSF, f-Met-Leu-Phe chemiluminescence was 27 +/- 1.6 mV in low f-Met-Leu-Phe responders compared to controls (87.7 +/- 11 mV, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, although responses were improved, they were not as marked as in control neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients have a low f-Met-Leu-Phe chemiluminescence response which is not due to a defect in the f-Met-Leu-Phe receptor or oxidase activity, and in the majority of cases MPO activity is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initial patient survival data suggest that these patients may have an increased risk of infective mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that defective f-Met-Leu-Phe chemiluminescence results from a putative defect in cell-signalling mechanism upstream of PKC, and GM-CSF priming only partially improves responsiveness </plain></SENT>
