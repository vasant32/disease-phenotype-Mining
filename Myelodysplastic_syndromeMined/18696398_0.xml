<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Attention is directed to changes in segmented granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of ultrastructural findings in abnormal blood smears with control cases is made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Important findings include reduced cytoplasmic granule number, <z:mp ids='MP_0000354'>increased cell size</z:mp>, large cytoplasmic vacuoles, condensation of the peripheral cytoplasm, prominence of large cytoplasmic granules, irregular cytoplasmic perimeter, abnormal nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, abnormal cell shape, and a necklace-like arrangement of cytoplasmic granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these findings, reduced cytoplasmic granule number was the most specific finding, while condensation of peripheral cytoplasm was the most sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination of these two morphologic findings may provide a strong predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study included a limited test of unknown cases evaluated by one author, including two uncertain for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pitfalls in evaluating temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> are noted </plain></SENT>
