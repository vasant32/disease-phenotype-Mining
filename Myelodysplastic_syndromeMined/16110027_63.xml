<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To improve the effect of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation by sequential use of intensive chemotherapy, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), and prophylactic donor lymphocyte transfusions (pDLTs) in high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study of 75 consecutive patients (median age, 52.3 years), high risk was defined by progressive or refractory disease (n = 59), second remission after early relapse (n = 8), or first remission with poor prognosis based on cytogenetics or delayed response to induction therapy (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfavorable karyotypes were found in 49% of informative patients, and 68 patients had medical contraindications against standard conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine (30 mg/m2), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (2 g/m2), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2687">amsacrine</z:chebi> (100 mg/m2) for 4 days were used for cytoreduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 days of rest, RIC consisted of 4 Gy total-body irradiation, antithymocyte globulin, and 80 to 120 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients had an HLA-identical sibling donor; 44 patients had an unrelated and/or HLA-mismatched donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>pDLT was given from day +120 in patients who were not receiving immunosuppression and were free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission was induced in 66 patients (88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 35.1 months (range, 13.6 to 47.6 months), 2-year overall and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival were 42% and 40%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcome of patients with refractory disease or with complex cytogenetic aberrations was identical to that of better prognostic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival was best in patients who received high CD34+ cell numbers, and in patients with limited GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sequential use of intensive chemotherapy, RIC transplantation, and pDLT represents a promising approach to the treatment of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, particularly in patients with most unfavorable prognoses </plain></SENT>
