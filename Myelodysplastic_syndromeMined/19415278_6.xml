<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From morphological aspects, these categories show overlaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether these morphological similarities have genetic parallels, we investigated 1,851 cases with suspected/confirmed myelodysplastic or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> by chromosome banding and molecular analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics revealed aberrant karyotypes in 354 patients (19.1% of the original cohort) who were the basis of further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of chromosomal aberrations differed significantly between categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isolated +9 and gain of 9p were exclusively observed in MPN (+9: 10/93; 11%; p &lt; 0.001; +9p: 6/93; 7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aberrant MPN cases) but were not detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isolated del(5q) (p = 0.002), -7 in combination with other aberrations (p = 0.016), and complex aberrations (p = 0.003) were 2.9- to 7.5-fold more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in MPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomies</z:mp> 8 and 21 and del(20q) were comparably frequent in both subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN overlap cohort showed a higher frequency of -7 accompanied by other aberrations (3/17; 18% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aberrant cases; p = 0.001), i(17)(q10) (2/17; 12%; p = 0.013), and +21 (2/17; 12%; p = 0.013) when compared to MPN or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These differences support the category for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN within the new WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overlaps between the diverse disorders were seen also for the JAK2V617F (MPN 66/89; 74%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN 4/14; 29%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> 2/63; 3%) and NRAS mutations (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> 2/67; 3%; MPN 2/4; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN 1/1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cytogenetics and molecular genetics show overlaps in varying proportions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and MPN cases which might indicate common pathways in their etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Some markers are strongly associated with one of these disorders and can be helpful for differential diagnosis especially in difficult cases </plain></SENT>
