<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> spectrum of disorders, these patients have been categorized into prognostic subgroups, predominantly using the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several drugs have been used to treat these patients, and their selection and sequential recommended use by the panel depend on disease characteristics and responses to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombinant erythropoietin alfa and darbepoetin alfa have been the mainstay of therapy for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FDA has recently approved several other drugs for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of disease, lenalidomide for low-risk anemic patients with del(5q) chromosomal abnormality, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For iron chelation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> is also used occasionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy (antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporin) has been therapeutically beneficial for a subset of younger patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the financial cost of these therapies are substantial and have received only limited attention, this article evaluates the costs of specific drugs and their sequential use in the lower-risk IPSS (low and intermediate-1) subgroups based on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29308,30347">NCCN</z:chebi> guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results estimate an average annual cost for potentially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>-altering drugs of $63,577 per patient, ranging from $26,000 to $95,000, depending on the specific therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients for whom the therapies fail, annual costs for iron chelation plus red blood cell transfusions are estimated to average $41,412 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The economic impact of drug therapy should be weighed against the patient's potential for improvement in clinical outcomes, quality of life, and transfusion requirements </plain></SENT>
