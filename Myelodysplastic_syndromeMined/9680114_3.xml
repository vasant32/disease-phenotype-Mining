<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients showed a reciprocal chromosomal translocation or an inversion, and 34 patients showed only unbalanced aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Balanced aberrations were predominantly detected in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients who did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and a history of chemotherapy or radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, unbalanced aberrations were more frequently seen in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with trilineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two mutations of the N-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and TP53 genes were detected, and these mutations were frequently associated with unbalanced chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the spectrum of mutations was suggestive of an exposure to alkylating chemicals </plain></SENT>
