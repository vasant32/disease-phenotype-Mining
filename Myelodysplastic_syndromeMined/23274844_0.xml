<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that BC radiation treatment is associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) as seen in a previously conducted study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used 2001-2009 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database records to identify a cohort of women with first primary stage 0 BC who were treated with radiation, a group which is not treated with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> diagnoses in the cohort using SEER to query appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-O-3 codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared observed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> rates in the BC cohort to expected rates, estimated as first primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in the entire female population, and calculated observed/expected rate ratios with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, a very small number of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> occurred in this cohort with 22 observed cases versus 9.4 expected cases using national incidence data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We estimated an increased risk of 2.34 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in stage 0 BC cases treated with radiation compared to the general population (95 % CI 1.49, 3.46, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age adjusted relative risk is 1.46, (95 % CI 0.93, 2.16, p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that radiation treatment for BC is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and affects a very small number of patients </plain></SENT>
