<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One group comprised 7 patients with either the typical t(15;17) alone or a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, and the other group comprised 10 patients with additional karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No patient had received prior chemotherapy or irradiation, and no cases were complicated by a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> before the diagnosis of APL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics at disease presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 patients and karyotypes of bone marrow cells normalized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in relapse rate, overall survival, or disease-free survival between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis did not reveal any significant effect of additional chromosomal abnormalities on the prognosis of APL patients undergoing treatment with ATRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a small number of patients were assessed in this study, and further cumulative studies are needed </plain></SENT>
