<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial investigation showed numerical and/or major structural abnormalities [t(3;3), 5q-, -7, or 7q-, 11q-] in nine patients (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, minimal terminal deletions were observed in 2p, 8p, 9p, 11p, 12p, 17p, 17q, 20q, and Xp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detection of these deletions, which have not been reported earlier, was due to consistent application of the high resolution technique, G-banding without trypsin, and metaphase photography on large size negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each deletion occurred as a clone on one or more occasions in 1-17 patients (mean, 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One or other clonal minimal deletion was observed in 32 patients (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preliminary indirect evidence indicates that alone or together with other factors the deletions promote leukemic transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
