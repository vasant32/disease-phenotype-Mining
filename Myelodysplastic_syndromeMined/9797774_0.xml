<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of 72 consecutive de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 4 of these cases, the -7 was the only abnormality, whereas the remaining 8 cases showed additional chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) utilizing chromosome 7 alpha-satellite and painting probes and other specific probes, when necessary, provided evidence of unusual and unsuspected structural rearrangements involving chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis showed that the small fragment found in one patient and the ring found in each of two other patients were chromosome 7-derived rings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH also revealed the insertion of chromosome 7 sequences into autosomes in three other patients and unusual translocations in the remaining two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By comparing the results obtained by using banding techniques to those obtained by using the FISH technique, we deduced the involvement of chromosome 7 with partial deletion of the short arm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight examined patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms the ability of FISH to detect chromosomal aberrations that would otherwise not be identified and the tendency of chromosome 7 to be involved in many different rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From a clinical point of view, we confirm that patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> with complex karyotypes involving chromosome 7 do not respond to treatment and have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
