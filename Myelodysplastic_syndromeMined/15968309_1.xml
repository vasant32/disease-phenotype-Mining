<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of common fusion genes analysis in the diagnosis and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> by multiplex RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The multiplex RT-PCR, including 8 parallel PCR reactions, could screen 86 mRNA breakpoints or splice variants at the same time, which was important for the diagnosis and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow samples from 161 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 8 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were involved in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of common fusion genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was analyzed by the method mentioned above in combination with clinical and morphological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten fusion genes were detected in 115 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, including AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>, PML/RAR alpha, PLZF/RAR alpha, dupMLL, MLL/AF6, MLL/AF10, CBFbeta/MYH11, BCR/ABL, Hox11, and EVI1 BCR/ABL was positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 52 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; PML/RAR alpha was found in 21 of 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (APL), and PLZF/RAR alpha was detected in one case of APL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases of 17 AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi>-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) belonged to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026999" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB-M2</z:e> subtype, and one case was mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of 4 AL cases carrying CBFbeta/MYH11 were M4 subtype, and one was M5 subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MLL aberrations were found in 16 AL, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MLL/AF6 translocation existed in M5 subtype with classic monoblastic characters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BCR/ABL was detected in 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fusion genes were also found in 2 MDS cases, of which AML1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> positive-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Screening of common fusion genes by multiplex RT-PCR is an important tool which could provide useful and reliable molecular genetic information for the diagnosis and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
