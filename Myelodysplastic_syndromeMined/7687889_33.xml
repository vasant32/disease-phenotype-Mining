<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with both recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) to determine whether such combination therapy resulted in improvement of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of 28 patients begun on study completed the protocol and were evaluable for erythroid responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapy was initiated with G-CSF at 1 micrograms/kg administered by daily subcutaneous injection and adjusted to either normalize or double the neutrophil count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EPO was then administered by daily subcutaneous injection at a dose of 100 U/kg and dose-escalated to 150 and 300 U/kg every 4 weeks while continuing the G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in absolute reticulocyte count, hematocrit level, and need for RBC transfusions were compared with pretreatment values as well as other blood cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten of 24 patients (42%) had erythroid responses, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had neutrophil responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six previously transfused patients no longer required RBC transfusions during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Erythroid responses were found to be independent of patient age, French-American-British subtype, duration of disease, prior RBC transfusion requirements, or cytogenetic abnormalities at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment serum EPO levels were lower in erythroid-responding as compared with nonresponding patients (median 157 v 600 U/L; P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combined treatment modality was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a substantial percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients had both erythroid and myeloid responses when treated with the combination of G-CSF and EPO </plain></SENT>
