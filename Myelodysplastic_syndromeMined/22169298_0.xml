<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>37 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 10 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 14 patients with non-clonal cytopenia diseases were chosen for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression level of CXCR4 on CD34(+) cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34(+) cells in bone marrow were detected by flow cytometry; the chemotaxis of SDF-1 on bone marrow mononuclear cells in 4 patients with low risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (IPSS score ≤ 1.0) and 5 patients with high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (IPSS score ≥ 1.5) was assayed by transwell migration test of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of SDF-1 on cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> capability was measured by using CCK-8 method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of CD34(+) cells was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with low risk (IPPS score &lt; 1.0) than that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with high risk (IPSS score ≥ 1.5) (21.55% vs 7.52%, p &lt; 0.001); as well, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of CD34(+) cells was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with low risk than that in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (21.55% vs 7.33%, p &lt; 0.001), no relation of CD34(+) cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with age and sex of patients was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SDF-1 could promote the cells of patients with CXCR4 high expression to adhere to the stroma cells, and induce migration of these cells, as well as, SDF-1 could trigger the polarization of the cells which highly expressed CXCR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After addition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pertussis</z:e> toxin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> and AMD3100, the ability of adhersion and migration of the cells with highly expressed CXCR4 decreased, but there was no above-mentioned phenomenon in patients who lowly expressed CXCR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis enhances the ability of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration through PI3K signaling pathway, thereby plays antiapoptosis role, moreover the above-mentioned effects can be blocked by PI3K pathway inhibitor and G protein inhibitor </plain></SENT>
