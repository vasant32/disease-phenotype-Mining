<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients were enrolled according to the following French-American-British classification: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (20), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (35), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004828'>refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts</z:hpo> (9), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified by their serum erythropoietin levels (less than or equal to 500 mU/mL, n = 37; greater than 500 mU/mL, n = 29) and randomized, in a 2:1 ratio, to either GM-CSF (0.3-5.0 microg/kg.d) + epoetin alfa (150 IU/kg 3 times/wk) or GM-CSF (0.3-5.0 microg/kg.d) + placebo (3 times/wk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean neutrophil count rose from 948 to 3831 during treatment with GM-CSF +/- epoetin alfa </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percentages of patients in the epoetin alfa and the placebo groups requiring transfusions of red blood cells were 60% and 92%, respectively, for the low-endogenous erythropoietin patients and 95% and 89% for the high-endogenous erythropoietin patients (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the average numbers of units of red blood cells transfused during the 12-week study in the epoetin alfa and the placebo groups were 5.9 and 9.5, respectively, in the low-endogenous erythropoietin patients and 9.7 and 8.6 in the high-endogenous erythropoietin patients (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF +/- epoetin alfa had no effect on mean platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated in most patients, though 10 withdrew from the study for reasons related predominantly to GM-CSF toxicity </plain></SENT>
