<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>P-170 membrane staining was demonstrated in bone marrow blast cells of 14/17 HR-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in 2/9 LR-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P-170 expression was associated with the presence of blast cells characterized by an immature or early myeloid phenotype as defined by CD34 expression (p = 0.034), CD13 or CD33 expression (p = 0.0006), or CD13/33 plus terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) double expression (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With double fluorescence analysis, P-170 expression was observed in a subset of CD34+ cells, but not in CD34- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P-170 expression was present in 13/15 (86%) patient samples with an abnormal karyotype as compared with 3/10 samples (30%) with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of these 15 patients had a loss or a deletion of chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen out of 16 (81%) <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 positive patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> versus two of ten (20%) <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 negative patients (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is present in cells with an immature phenotype and is frequently observed in patients who have an abnormal karyotype and a high risk of leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
