<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were subclassified: six as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, one as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> and six as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T-cell subsets and natural killer cells were identified in the peripheral blood with the use of monoclonal antibodies and natural killer cell activity (NKa) was assayed before, during and after a-INF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment schedule consisted of 2.0 MU/m2 sc t.i.w. continuously for the three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to treatment, NKa was found decreased in 11 of 13 patients as compared to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following a-IFN administration, a rise of NKa was observed in eight of the eleven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those who responded, a-IFN was continued for 1 to 21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alpha-IFN treatment was myelosuppressive for most of the patients, but transient increase of the number of neutrophils and platelets was observed in 3 and of the reticulocytes in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease progression was recorded in 9/13 patients (69%) at a median time of 17.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 30.5 months (range 7.5 to 65+ months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No evidence of a relationship was found between the rise in Nka and the limited clinical improvement observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two NKa responders under continuous a-IFN treatment are in stable clinical condition for 36+ and 65+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study provides only limited evidence that a-IFN may improve the clinical course of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
