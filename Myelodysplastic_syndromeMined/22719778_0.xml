<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Persistent RHAMM expression and decreasing CD8+ T-cell responses to RHAMM in the framework of allogeneic stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy alone might indicate the immune escape of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed the expression of RHAMM in 48 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we correlated transcripts with the clinical course of the disease before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T cell responses against RHAMM were assessed by tetramer staining (flow cytometry) and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were correlated with the clinical outcome of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study showed that almost 60% of the patients were RHAMM positive; specific T-cells recognizing RHAMM could be detected, but they were nonfunctional in terms of interferon gamma or granzyme B release as demonstrated by ELISPOT assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunotherapies like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> vaccination or adoptive transfer of RHAMM-specific T cells might improve the immune response and the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
