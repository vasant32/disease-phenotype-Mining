<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the apoptotic effect of triptolide on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cell line MUTZ-1 cells and its mechanism, MUTZ-1 cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of triptolide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The growth of MUTZ-1 cells was observed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was detected by DNA fragmentation analysis and flow cytometry using Annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>/PI staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene and protein expressions were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that MUTZ-1 cell viability in presence of triptolide decreased markedly in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The growth-inhibitory IC50 value for triptolide treatment was 55.06 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A DNA ladder pattern of internucleosomal fragmentation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The translocation of phosphatidylserine at the outer surface of the cell plasma membrane could be induced by triptolide and its level increased following the augmentation of the drug concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of MUTZ-1 cells with triptolide for 12 hours resulted in the activation of caspase-3, cleavage of PARP and decrease of c-IAP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expressions of pro-caspase 3 and c-IAP2 were inversely correlated with the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(r = -0.907, P = 0.000; r = -0.919, P = 0.000 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Triptolide inhibits MUTZ-1 cell growth by inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic effect of triptolide in MUTZ-1 cells is mediated by the caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the activation of caspase-3 may be associated with the down-regulation of c-IAP2 </plain></SENT>
