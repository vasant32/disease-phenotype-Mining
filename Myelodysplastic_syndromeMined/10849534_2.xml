<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We determined prospectively the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (HRBC) after high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and correlated the cytogenetic abnormalities with the development of post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1990 to 1999, 229 women with HRBC underwent ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow (BM) cells was performed 12-59 months after ASCT in 60 consecutive women uniformly treated with six courses of FAC/FEC followed by HDCT and ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 36 months after ASCT, there were no cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> among the 229 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the selected cohort of 60 patients, three (5%) showed clonal chromosomal abnormalities (two single <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> X and one t(1;6)), whereas two additional patients showed non-clonal reciprocal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients with clonal aberrations had blood cytopenias as well as subtle dysplastic pictures in BM which were not classifiable as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> according to the FAB criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar dysplastic features were also observed in four patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cytogenetic aberrations were transient and disappeared, except a +X detected by FISH in a residual cell population in one of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Retrospective cytogenetic and FISH studies of samples obtained after six cycles of FAC/FEC and before transplant demonstrated no chromosomal abnormalities in any of the five patients with post-ASCT karyotypic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early changes in karyotype detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients following ASCT are transient and do not correlate with or predict development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As these aberrations were not present before ASCT, they may be related to the HDCT regimen or transplant procedure rather than to the prior adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that ASCT may be less likely to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients as compared to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
