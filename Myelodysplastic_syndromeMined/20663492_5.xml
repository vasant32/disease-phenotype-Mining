<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induced anti-leukemic T-cell-responses are variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further elicit DC/DC(leu)-induced T-cell-response-patterns we performed (functional)flow-cytometry/fluorolysis-assays before/after mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) of matched (allogeneic) donor-T-cells (n=6), T-cells prepared at relapse after stem cell transplantation (n=4) or (autologous) patients'-T-cells (n=7) with blast-containing-mononuclear-cells ('MNC') or DC(leu)-containing DC ('DC') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to 'MNC' 'DC' were better mediators of anti-leukaemic T-cell-activity, although not in every case effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We could define cut-off proportions of mature DC, DC(leu), proliferating, CD4(+), CD8(+) and non-naive T-cells after 'MNC'- or 'DC'-stimulation, that were predictive for an anti-leukemic-activity of stimulated T-cells as well as a response to immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly especially ratios &gt;1 of CD4:CD8 or CD45RO:CD45RA T-cells were predictive for anti-leukemic function after DC-stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary the composition and quality of DC and T-cells after a MLC-stimulating-phase is predictive for a successful ex-vivo and in-vivo anti-leukemic response, especially with respect to proportions of proliferating, CD4(+) and CD45RO(+) T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Successful cytotoxicity and the development of a T-cell-memory after 'DC'-stimulation could be predictive for the clinical course of the disease and may pave the way to develop adoptive immunotherapy, especially for patients at relapse after SCT </plain></SENT>
