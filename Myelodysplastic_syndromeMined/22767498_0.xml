<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the impact of the recently established 5-group cytogenetic classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> on outcome after HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with the impact of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) 3 cytogenetic risk groups, and the additional effect of a monosomal karyotype was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included data on 1007 patients, 1-75 years old (median 45 years), transplanted from related (n = 547) or unrelated (n = 460) donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various conditioning regimens were used, and marrow, peripheral blood, or cord blood served as stem cell source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both IPSS and 5-group cytogenetic risk classifications were significantly associated with post-HCT relapse and mortality, but the 5-group classification discriminated more clearly among the lowest- and highest-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A monosomal karyotype tended to further increase the rates of relapse and mortality, even after considering the IPSS or 5-group classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the pathologic disease category correlated with both relapse and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was also impacted by patient age, donor type, conditioning regimen, platelet count, and etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although mortality declined significantly in recent years, novel strategies are needed to overcome the barrier of high-risk cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
