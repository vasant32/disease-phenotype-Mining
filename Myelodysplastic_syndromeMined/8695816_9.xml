<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>t(3;12)(q26;p13) appears as a rare but nonrandom event present in various myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> subtypes, which is frequently associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of megakaryocytes, multilineage involvement, short duration of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blastic phase</z:e>, and a very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the molecular cytogenetic analysis of the t(3;12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization results indicate that the 3q26 breakpoints are quite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and occur 5' of MDS1, 3' of EVI1, or between MDS1 and EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results are very similar to those observed in other 3q26 rearrangements in which breakpoints were shown to occur over considerable distances 5' and 3' of EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization investigations proved that, in three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> cases with t(3;12)(q26;p13), the 12p 13 breakpoint occurred within the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene </plain></SENT>
