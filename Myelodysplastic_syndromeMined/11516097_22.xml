<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Considering the recently stated suggestion of neovascularization being implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) pathogenesis, we evaluated multiple morphometric microvascular characteristics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, in relation to clinicopathologic factors and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trephines from 50 newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were immunostained for factor VIII and compared to those from 20 controls, 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) and 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitation of microvessel density (MVD), area, total vascular area (TVA), major and minor axis length, perimeter, compactness, shape factor, Feret diameter, and the number of branching vessels was performed by image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group had significantly higher MVD, TVA, minor axis and shape factor values and significantly lower compactness than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was characterized by increased vascularity compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, as well as by the presence of flattened microvessels (lower values of shape factor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showed higher MVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> displayed larger caliber vessels than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, which explains the favorable prognostic effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0001264'>increased size</z:mp>-related parameters on progression and/or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, decreased compactness and MVD were independent predictors of longer progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is involved in the conversion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and ultimately to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and that disease progression within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is accompanied by qualitative alterations of the microvascular network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, size-related parameters affect survival, while shape-related parameters and MVD are more influential with regard to progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
