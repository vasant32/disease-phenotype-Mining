<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An echocardiograph showed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes but her plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) activity was increased at 343 U/l (&lt; 175 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The apparent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase-MB activity by a CK-M subunit immunoinhibition assay was 350 U/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In view of the discrepancy between the total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase and CK-MB activity plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase electrophoresis studies were performed which showed not only a band of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase-MM but also a band of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase-BB, 53% of the total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No band of CK-MB was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It later transpired that the woman had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that premalignant and malignant haematological conditions should be considered in patients with an unexplained increase in plasma CK-BB </plain></SENT>
