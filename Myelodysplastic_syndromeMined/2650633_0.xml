<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Results of our study on the activation of N-ras oncogene by point mutation in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> have been described in this article </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Point mutation was observed mainly on the 12th, 13th and 61st amino acid codon of ras genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, oligomers containing mutations at these codons were used as probes for dot blot analysis of DNA derived from patient's bone marrow cells or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction technique was used to amplify the DNA of ras genes containing 12th, 13th and 61st codons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By this technique, sensitivity of the method to detect the point mutations in ras oncogene was remarkably increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detection of the mutation in ras gene is considered to be very useful for the diagnosis, determination of remission and finding of relapse at an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Study on the fused gene of bcr-abl, its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> is a good and reliable method to prove the existence of Ph1 positive chromosome by gene technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Identification of the Ph1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) has become possible by studying abl oncogene in Ph1 positive ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This method can be used also for the diagnosis of Ph1 ALL </plain></SENT>
