<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We evaluated nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and a galactomannan enzyme immunosorbent assay (GM-EIA) for the diagnosis of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> (IA) in neutropenic febrile patients and for monitoring of its clinical course and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected twice per week from 128 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> during periods of neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> after undergoing chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 448 blood samples were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 14 patients with IA (2 patients with proven IA and 12 with probable IA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median index of the initial NASBA in the IA group was more than 10-fold higher than that in the non-IA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Galactomannan antigenemia (index, &gt;0.5) was detected with a sensitivity of 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In receiver-operator characteristic analysis, the cutoff index of NASBA for the presumptive diagnosis of IA was determined to be 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combination of these 2 parameters (either a GM-EIA index of &gt;or=0.5 or a NASBA index of &gt;or=5.0) improved the sensitivity of diagnosis to 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a close relationship between patient outcome and the kinetics of NASBA values: failure of negative conversion during treatment resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: If either GM-EIA or NASBA results suggest IA, the diagnostic yield for IA could be improved, and NASBA could be a useful marker for predicting the clinical course and outcome of treatment </plain></SENT>
