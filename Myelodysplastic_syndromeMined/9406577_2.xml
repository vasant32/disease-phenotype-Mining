<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 49-year-old woman who presented with a monoclonally IgG kappa expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> since October 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four years later, after 24 cycles of Melphalan-containing chemotherapy, bone marrow (BM) cells of the patient cytologically revealed myelodysplastic changes for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic examination of the BM obtained in January 1994 showed two clonally aberrant main lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each of them represented one of the hematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The quantitatively major clone (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-clone) showed a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7, typical for secondary myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other clone (<z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> (MM) clone) was characterized by a reciprocal translocation between the short arm of chromosome 8, band q24, a region known to contain the c-myc gene, and the long arm of chromosome 2, band p12, where the Ig kappa gene is located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An unusual finding, however, was that an abnormality of the long arm of chromosome 16 could be detected in both obviously unrelated clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the further course of the disease, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and MM clones could be detected, both of them showing cytogenetically a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> characterized by additional clonal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data stress the significance of cytogenetics in detecting typical clonal abnormalities in different malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> and in detecting "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e>" as an indicator of the progress of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our data suggest that MM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may arise from a common stem cell, which may be characterized by a clonal cytogenetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
