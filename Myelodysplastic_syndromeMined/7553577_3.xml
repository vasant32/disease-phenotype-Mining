<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was refined as 46,XX,der(2)t(2;11) (q35;?p13),der(11)dic r(11)(:p13--&gt;q13::p13--&gt;q13:) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that the chromosome composition of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> can be identified more systematically and accurately using these combined molecular cytogenetic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DOP-PCR methodology modified is suitable for the practical application of micro-FISH on specimens prepared for routine banding analysis </plain></SENT>
