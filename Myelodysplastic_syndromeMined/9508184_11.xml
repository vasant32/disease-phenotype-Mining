<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients after high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with a single conditioning regimen and autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT), and analyze the cytogenetic abnormalities that arise after HDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 864 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients who underwent ABMT at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, from 1985 through 1996 who received the same preparative regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 1,875 mg/m2 for 3 days, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> 55 mg/m2 for 3 days, and BCNU 600 mg/m2 for 1 day (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretransplant cytogenetics were analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and posttransplant cytogenetics were evaluated in four of five patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/AL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of 864 patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/AL after HDC with CPB and ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The crude cumulative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/AL was 0.58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier curve shows a 4-year probability of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/AL of 1.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretransplant cytogenetics performed on these five patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Posttransplant cytogenetics were performed on four of five patients and they were abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four, although only one patient had the most common cytogenetic abnormality associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>/AL (chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/AL is a potential complication of HDC with CPB and ABMT, the incidence in this series of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> was relatively low compared with that reported in patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who underwent ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic abnormalities reported in this group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients were not typical of those seen in prior reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280745" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary MDS</z:e>/AL and appear to have occurred after HDC </plain></SENT>
