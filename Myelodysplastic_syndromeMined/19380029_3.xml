<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NUP98-NSD3 fusion transcripts have been detected previously in one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and one patient with t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> having t(8;11)(p11;p15) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the NUP98 gene at 11p15 was split by the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis of bone marrow cells showed both rearrangements of NUP98 and NSD3 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by sequence analysis revealed the presence of both NUP98-NSD3 and NSD3-NUP98 fusion transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis by RT-PCR showed that NSD3 as well as NSD1 and NSD2 was ubiquitously expressed in leukemic cell lines and Epstein-Barr virus transformed B lymphocyte cell lines derived from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult lymphocytes examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two isoforms of NSD3, NSD3S and NSD3L (but not NSD3L2), were expressed in leukemic cell lines and were fused to NUP98 in our patient, suggesting that qualitative change of these two isoforms of NSD3 by fusion with NUP98 might be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>, although the function of each isoform of the NSD3 gene remains unclear </plain></SENT>
