<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>And chromosome findings of bone marrow cells from patients with this syndrome are reported to have one of the greatest prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our chromosome study of 97 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we found clonally abnormal karyotypes in 61 patients (63%), including the whole chromosome or partial loss of long arm of chromosome 7 (-7/7q-) in 18 patients and a partial loss of chromosome 5 (5q-) in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these 97 patients, 26 received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> chemotherapy (small dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>; 23 patients, small dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22696">behenoyl</z:chebi> Ara-C; 2, and intensive combined chemotherapy; 1) as well as supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these 26 treated cases, pretreatment hematological characteristics or FAB subclassifications were not associated with response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only one of 9 patients with -7/7q- and/or 5q- achieved a partial remission, while 5 of 8 patients with other abnormal karyotypes and 4 of 9 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype achieved a complete (4 patients) or a partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pretreatment cytogenetic findings can predict the potential responders to this chemotherapy, and may be one of the most important factors in the selection of the treatment for this ill-managed syndrome </plain></SENT>
