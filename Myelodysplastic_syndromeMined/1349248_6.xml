<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amplification of the VNTR loci in DNA from BMMC using the polymerase chain reaction revealed the persistence of host cells in two of four patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the patients, whose cultured lymphocytes inhibited in vitro growth of donor-derived hemopoietic progenitor cells, responded to immunosuppressive therapy and donor-derived hemopoiesis was restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other patient, host-derived polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) appeared together with donor-derived PMN from the early post-transplant period, and he proceeded to relapse with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other two patients in whom host cells were not detectable, the marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> improved significantly as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD improved in response to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that detecting minimal residual host cells by means of amplification of VNTR loci is valuable for understanding the etiology of late graft failure in marrow transplant recipients, and could prove helpful for choosing appropriate therapy for this syndrome </plain></SENT>
