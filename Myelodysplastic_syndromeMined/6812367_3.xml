<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About half of these subjects showed an abnormal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> and K+ leakage of their RBC, which were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean rate of the glycolytic pathway increased significantly and the glycolysis values correlated well with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 9 out of the 13 patients showed an abnormal biosynthetic ratio of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> chains in their reticulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the multiple defects in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="888">DMPS</z:chebi> erythrocytes do not seem clearly linked by cause-effect relationships, they probably derive from several cooperating factors in pathological erythroid precursors, leading to RBC membrane damage </plain></SENT>
