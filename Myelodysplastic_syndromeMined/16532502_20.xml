<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment duration with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> (DAC) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) remains a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although at least 2 consolidating courses after best response usually are performed, the response to treatment after disease recurrence has not been systematically studied to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the current study, the authors report on 22 of 108 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (20%) treated with low-dose DAC in 3 Phase II trials who received DAC as retreatment at the time of disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) at the time of initial treatment, 5 of 22 patients (23%) had a score of intermediate-1 (Int-1), 4 patients (18%) had a score of Int-2, and 13 patients (59%) were scored as high-risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients initially received a median of 6 courses of DAC (range, 2 courses-6 courses), which resulted in a complete remission (complete response [CR]) in 12 of the 22 patients (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retreatment with DAC at the time of disease recurrence was initiated at a median of 11 months (range, 3 mos-27 mos) after the last course of initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to DAC retreatment, patients received a median of 3 courses (range, 1 courses-6 courses), with 10 of 22 patients (45%) responding (1 with a CR and 2 with partial remissions [partial response (PR)]; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients achieved a CR at the time of initial treatment) and 7 patients demonstrating a hematologic improvement (HI) (at the time of initial treatment there were 2 CRs, 4 PRs, and 1 HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 22 patients (55%) did not demonstrate any objective responses to retreatment, including 4 patients with primary resistance to the first course of retreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from the initiation of the first DAC course was 27.5 months (range, 15 mos-50+ mos) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median survival of 43 patients who also had achieved a response to the initial treatment with DAC but who received best supportive care (n = 33 patients) or induction chemotherapy (n = 10 patients) was 18 months (range, 5 mos-72 mos) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Second responders to DAC retreatment were found less frequently in the IPSS high-risk group compared with nonresponders (40% vs. 83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age, French-American-British classification subtype, serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level at retreatment, and previous response to DAC were not found to strongly differ between the groups; however, the subgroups were too small to perform a statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Retreatment with DAC was found to result in objective responses in 45% of previously DAC-responsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the quality and duration of the second disease remissions were found to be inferior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, DAC-responsive patients might derive more clinical benefit from continuation of the initial treatment </plain></SENT>
