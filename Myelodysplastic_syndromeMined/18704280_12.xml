<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">Desferrioxamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31460">Desferal</z:chebi>; Novartis, Switzerland) and Deferiprone (Ferriprox; Apotex, Canada) are ICTs used to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> requires 8-to 12-hour infusions a minimum of five times per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deferiprone is administered in an oral daily regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although pharmacologically efficacious, clinical effectiveness of ICT within the real-world setting is yet to be fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A naturalistic cohort study of 60 patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassaemia</z:e>, n=40; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e>, n=14; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, n=6; 63% female) receiving ICT in four UK treatment centres was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin level data were abstracted from medical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compliance, HRQOL, satisfaction and resource utilisation data were collected from interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximum ICT costs were estimated using the resource utilisation data associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean serum ferritin levels, generally, remained elevated despite ICT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compliance was suboptimal and HRQOL scores were lower than population norms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The total estimated mean weighted annual per-patient cost of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> treatment was approximately pound19,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>-related equipment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> drug, and home healthcare were estimated to account for 43%, 19% and 24% of costs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other more minor components of total annual costs were for in-patient infusions, ICT home delivery services and monitoring costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Generally, patients are not achieving target serum ferritin thresholds despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>ICT appears to negatively impact HRQOL; compliance with ICT is poor; and, in the case of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>, treatment costs well exceed the cost of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that current ICT in the real-world setting is suboptimal with respect to various clinical, HRQOL and economic outcomes </plain></SENT>
