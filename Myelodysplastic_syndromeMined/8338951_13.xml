<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow and blood from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were studied by simultaneous analysis of cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A combined technique of May-Gr√ºnwald Giemsa (MGG) for cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome-specific DNA probes for detection of cytogenetic aberrations allowed us to investigate cell-lineage-specific chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We introduced video recordings to examine large numbers of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Briefly, evaluation was first performed on MGG slides, during which cell position and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were recorded on an S-VHS recorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the same slides were used for FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This resulted in the identification of MGG-stained cells on the video screen and, at the same time, the interpretation of FISH signals in the fluorescence microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specimens of bone marrow or blood samples from four patients with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these patients was studied before and after cytotoxic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The gain or loss of chromosomes could be detected easily and morphologically assigned to the blasts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and to a variable proportion of the myelomonocytic lineage in two patients, but not to the lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, this method provides new possibilities for investigating the clonality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
