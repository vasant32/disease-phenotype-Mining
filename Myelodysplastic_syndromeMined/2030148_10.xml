<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical and morphometric analysis was performed on trephine biopsy specimens of the bone marrow in 40 patients (23 men and 17 women, mean age 62 years) with different subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to determine dysmegakaryopoiesis, but particularly precursor cells--that is, pro- and megakaryoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 31 of the 40 patients the numbers of megakaryocytes were increased which was associated with a predominance of smaller cell forms (micromegakaryocytes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi> Schiff, immunostaining with a formalin resistant monoclonal antibody against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIIa (Y2/51(CD61) showed a clinically important proportion of immature elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These could be designated pro- and megakaryoblasts by taking morphometric measurements on smears and bone marrow sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a relevant increase in the number of promegakaryoblasts in 32 patients, consistent with uncontrolled expansion of the precursor pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen repeated bone marrow biopsy specimens taken after chemotherapy largely showed a decrease in the numbers of megakaryocytes including the precursor cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, morphometric evaluation disclosed that micromegakaryocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> differ significantly from those in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) due to distinctive nuclear features and a disturbed nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes generate a more pleomorphic or atypical appearance of this cell population in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, compared with micromegakaryocytes in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the disproportionate increase in megakaryocyte precursors and the grossly abnormal aspects of micromegakaryocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are characteristics of the severe defect involving haematopoiesis in this disorder </plain></SENT>
