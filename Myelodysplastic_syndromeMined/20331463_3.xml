<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Testing the anomalies of stage- or lineage-specific surface antigens in CD34+ blasts can distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from non-clonal cytopenic diseases, and also reflect the pathological characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as a class of clonal diseases for providing new clues to basic research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study established a flow cytometric scoring system (FCMSS) based on theproportion and antigenic co-expression of CD34+ blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This FCMSS showed good sensitivity and specificity (77.8% and 100%) in the assisted diagnosis of low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without chromosome anomalies, ringed sideroblasts and excess marrow blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we explored and reported different modes of abnormal expression of CD34+ blasts antigens in different disease stages and analyzed the biological significance of the immunotypes for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found expression of mature myeloid antigens and lymphoid antigens gradually decreased, and early functional antigens gradually increased from low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karytype to low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with abnormal karyotype then to high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with higher FCM scores were generally accompanied with HLA-DR15 allele or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrow</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evolution of clones and immunological factors might have influence on expression of antigens in CD34+ blasts </plain></SENT>
