<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 22 months median follow-up, 562 (72%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Percentages of patients with IPSS-R "very good", "good", "intermediate", "poor" and "very poor" cytogenetic categories was 5%, 63%, 18%, 4% and 10%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding median survivals were 21, 40, 24, 18 and 6.5 months and the inter-group differences (good vs. very good/intermediate/poor vs. very poor; p&lt;0.01) or similarities (very good vs. intermediate vs. poor; p=0.79) were not significantly modified in multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were similar when analysis was restricted to 602 patients managed by supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MK adversely affected survival in both poor and very poor karyotype groups (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we were unable to confirm the prognostic superiority of IPSS-R-very good karyotype or prognostically distinguish between very good, intermediate and poor karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show additional prognostic information from MK in poor/very poor karyotype </plain></SENT>
