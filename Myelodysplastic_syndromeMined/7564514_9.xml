<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative diseases</z:e> that mainly involve brain, heart and muscle have been shown to result from mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 4977-bp deletion (mtDNA-4977, also known as the common deletion) is the most frequent abnormality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003737'>mitochondrial myopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A low percentage of mtDNA-4977 is also found in various tissues of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ageing individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of this deletion as well as other mtDNA deletions and point mutations is thought to contribute to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell ageing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined blood and bone marrow samples of 63 hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients undergoing sternotomy for cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using short-cycle PCR, which favors the amplification of molecules carrying large deletions, we detected the common deletion in 22 (35%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one of the probands, a hitherto unknown 4867-bp deletion was identified (nt 8561-13429) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each sample the percentage of mtDNA-4977 was very low, since detection always required primer-shift reamplification of a primary PCR product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because mtDNA molecules with large deletions are known to be progressively enriched through their tendency to replicate more rapidly than full-size mtDNA, the small amount of mtDNA-4977 detected is likely to be concentrated in a small fraction of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The common deletion was not detectable in 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), and 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The seeming paradox of detectability of mtDNA-4977 in hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and its absence in clonal myeloid disorders is explained by varying selection against self-renewing stem cells harboring the common deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Selection appears to be effective under circumstances of proliferative stress (eg among continuously proliferating stem cells in clonal hematopoiesis), whereas in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> steady-state hematopoiesis, affected stem cells persist because they are rarely recruited into cell cycle and can thus tolerate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction </plain></SENT>
