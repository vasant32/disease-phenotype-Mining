<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three of the nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases showed no cytogenetic abnormalities with or without any recombinant human hematopoietic growth factors; one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient with a t(3;4) did not show any change in the proportion of cells with this cytogenetic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining five cases exhibited changes in the frequency of subclones after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increasing number of metaphase cells with less complex chromosome abnormalities was observed in two of the five cases by treatment with rhG-CSF; one of them also showed an increasing number of cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After rhGM-CSF treatment, cells with nonclonal hyperdiploid abnormalities appeared in one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After erythropoietin treatment, an increasing number of cells with a prototypic change was observed in one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient, whereas one patient showed an increasing number of cells with an additional chromosome abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that hematopoietic growth factors possibly modify the constitution of marrow cells with multiple chromosome abnormalities and the degree is different in each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a chromosome analysis using an in vitro culture system with human recombinant hematopoietic growth factors may be able to detect metaphase cells with additional chromosome abnormalities in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
