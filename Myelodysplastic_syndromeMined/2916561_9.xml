<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination at the time of CLL diagnosis revealed a small but significant population of atypical blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow aspirate disclosed chromosomal abnormalities (-7, +8) suggestive of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Shortly after treatment of the CLL, there was proliferation of the previously noted blast population, which cytochemical studies demonstrated to be of the myeloid series thus indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> superimposed on CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report presents microscopic, cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and cytochemical evidence to document the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in the bone marrow of a patient with CLL after one course of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
