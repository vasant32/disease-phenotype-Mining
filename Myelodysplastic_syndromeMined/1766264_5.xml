<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concordance was close to 80% among 5 observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine percent (7 cases) were reclassified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of these hypergranular blasts was not suggestive of increased differentiation but rather leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reassignment of cases altered the median survival for the various subcategories, providing a clearer separation with the introduction of type III blasts than without utilizing these cells which were separated from the promyelocyte family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The introduction of this new blast cell definition in a larger series of patients is recommended to confirm these preliminary observations </plain></SENT>
