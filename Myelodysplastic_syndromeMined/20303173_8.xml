<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most up-regulated genes in patients included HBG2, HBG1, CYBRD1, HSPA1B, ANGPT, and MYC, while 13 genes related to B-lymphopoiesis showed down-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients decreased expression of genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair and increased expression of proto-oncogenes, angiogenic and anti-apoptic genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0000351'>increased cell proliferation</z:mp> and resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> together with a <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cell</z:mp> cycle control, damaged DNA repair and altered immune response may play an important role in malignant clone expansion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
