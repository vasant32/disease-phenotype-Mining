<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive treatment has dramatically improved outcome for these patients, but today we have to deal with the problems of relapses, cases refractory to treatment, and long-term side effects of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study comprises a consecutive series of 123 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> (n=56) or MPA (n=67) with biopsy-confirmed renal involvement, followed up for a median of 55 mo (range, 0.1 to 273.2 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 97% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of the patients (46%) relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in overall relapse rate according to type of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Renal survival was 78% in patients alive at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three variables seemed important for renal survival: serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, the titer of proteinase 3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> measured by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and B thrombocyte count, at time of referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> incidence data were obtained from the population-based South Swedish Regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Standardized morbidity ratio was calculated using expected values from the health care region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found an 11-fold increase in risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> for at least 12 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Skin <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> had the strongest relationship with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> use for at least 12 mo and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy for at least 48 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, four patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and five had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ of the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because the therapeutic regimen used today is not efficient enough to prevent relapses and is associated with a host of side effects, of which the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is by far the most important, improved therapy and medical care are needed for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> and MPA </plain></SENT>
