<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorders characterized by clonal hematopoiesis, impaired differentiation, peripheral-blood cytopenias, and a risk of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>Somatic mutations</z:hpo> may influence the clinical phenotype but are not included in current prognostic scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a combination of genomic approaches, including next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based genotyping, to identify mutations in samples of bone marrow aspirate from 439 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then examined whether the mutation status for each gene was associated with clinical variables, including specific cytopenias, the proportion of blasts, and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in 18 genes, including two, ETV6 and GNAS, that have not been reported to be mutated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 51% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had at least one point mutation, including 52% of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in RUNX1, TP53, and NRAS were most strongly associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) and an increased proportion of bone marrow blasts (P&lt;0.006 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariable Cox regression model, the presence of mutations in five genes retained independent prognostic significance: TP53 (hazard ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause, 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 3.84), EZH2 (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.36 to 3.33), ETV6 (hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.86), RUNX1 (hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.15), and ASXL1 (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Somatic point mutations are common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and are associated with specific clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutations in TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1, and ASXL1 are predictors of poor overall survival in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, independently of established risk factors </plain></SENT>
