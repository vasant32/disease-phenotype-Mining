<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (tMDS) and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (sAML), after high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous bone marrow or peripheral-blood progenitor-cell support, in patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1985 and November 1996, 230 patients underwent HDT comprising <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> therapy and total-body irradiation, with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support, as consolidation of remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 6 years, 27 (12%) developed tMDS or sAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median time to development of tMDS or sAML was 4.4 years (range, 11 months to 8.8 years) after HDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping (performed in 24 cases) at diagnosis of tMDS or sAML revealed complex karyotypes in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5/5q-, 15 had -7/7q-, seven had -18/18q-, seven had -13/13q-, and four had -20/20q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients died from complications of tMDS or sAML or treatment for tMDS or sAML, at a median of 10 months (range, 0 to 26 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen died without evidence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients were alive at a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 2 to 22 months) after diagnosis of tMDS or sAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, prior fludarabine therapy (P =.009) and older age (P =.02) were associated with the development of tMDS or sAML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased interval from diagnosis to HDT and bone marrow involvement at diagnosis were of borderline significance (P =.05 and.07, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: tMDS and sAML are serious complications of HDT for NHL and are associated with very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Alternative strategies for reducing their incidence and for treatment are needed </plain></SENT>
