<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 16-month-old female spayed Labrador Retriever was referred to the University of Edinburgh for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo>, inappetence, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A CBC showed severe nonregenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and moderate numbers of atypical cells with morphologic features most consistent with megakaryoblastic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar cells were identified in a bone marrow aspirate and accounted for 23% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nucleated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Atypical promegakaryocytes and megakaryocytes were also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> affecting the megakaryocytic lineage was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytologic examination of a fine-needle aspirate of the spleen revealed rare megakaryoblasts similar to those in blood and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At necropsy, the bone marrow consisted of atypical megakaryoblasts and megakaryocytes that were also infiltrating spleen, liver, lymph nodes, renal perihilar tissue, and visceral adipose tissue, consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> megakaryoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of splenic sections confirmed megakaryoblastic origin (immunoreactive for CD61 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some leukemic cells were also immunoreactive for myeloperoxidase (MPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This aberrant immunophenotype suggested both megakaryocytic and granulocytic/monocytic differentiation of the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of MPO-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> megakaryoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in a dog </plain></SENT>
