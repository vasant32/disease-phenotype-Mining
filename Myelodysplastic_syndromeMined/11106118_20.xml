<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few reports have been published on patients treated with the anthracenedione <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> which also targets topoisomerase II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed 10 cases of such t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> over a 7-year-period in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> combined with fluorouracil, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and regional radiotherapy, and in three cases with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36373">vindesine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients referred to our hospital for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with a past history of polychemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, either as adjuvant (8 patients)/neoadjuvant (1 patient) therapy or for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the probability of developing t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in a prospective series of 350 patients treated with an adjuvant FNC regimen (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, fluorouracil, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>) and radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 45 years (range 35-67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> developed 13-36 months (median 16) after beginning chemotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, and 4-28 months (median 10.5) after ending treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As described in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> following treatment with epipodophyllotoxins or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, we found a majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023479" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="AMML">FAB M4</z:e>, M5 and M3 phenotypes (7 of 10), and characteristic karyotype abnormalities that also can be found in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>: breakpoint on chromosome 11q23 (3 patients), inv(16)(p13q22) (2 patients), t(15;17)(q22;q11) (1 patient), t(8;21)(q22;q22) (1 patient) and del(20q)(q11) (1 patient) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since two patients had been enrolled in a prospective trial for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> which included 350 patients, the probability of developing t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was calculated to be 0.7% from 25-40 months, using the Kaplan-Meier method (95%, confidence interval (95% CI): 0.1-4.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, fluorouracil, and radiation therapy can induce t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, as with other topoisomerase II-targeted drugs </plain></SENT>
