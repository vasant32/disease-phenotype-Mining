<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells from healthy donors by stimulators such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo- PBSCT) is increasingly used clinically; however, the mechanism, the dose, and the schedule are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of single daily dose of 250 microg G-CSF (Lenograstim) for stem cell mobilization and hematopoietic reconstitution after allo-PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included a group of 38 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>:21 cases; <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>:14 cases; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>:3 cases) from January 2000 to June 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the 38 sibling or matched unrelated donors G-CSF was administered at single daily dose of 250 microg despite of their body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leukapheresis was performed on the fifth day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI)+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G-CSF support was given from the third day after stem cell reinfusion, usually until neutrophil recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average dosage of G-CSF administrated was 4.8 microg x (kg x d)(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An average of 1.7 times of apheresis were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median CD34(+) cell and CD34(+)/CD38(-) cell yield were 6.09 x 10(6)/kg and 1.33 x 10(6)/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio of the leukapheresis products was 1.41+/-0.51,and (17.61+/-6.64)% of the leukapheresis products were CD3(-)/CD16(+)CD56(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was used after reinfusion for the median time of 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median time for WBC &gt;1 x 10(9)/L, ANC &gt;0.5 x 10(9)/L,and PLT &gt;20 x 10(9)/L were 11,11,and 12 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient died of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> on the fifth day after transplantation, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other patients achieved hematopoietic reconstitution satisfyingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The administration of G-CSF in the single dose fashion in allo-PBSCT has a good effect in the mobilization of PBSC with minor side effects, and it can markedly promote hematopoietic reconstitution after transplantation </plain></SENT>
