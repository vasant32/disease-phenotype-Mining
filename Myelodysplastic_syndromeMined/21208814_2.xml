<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants were men and women age 65 and older with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> as defined by World Health Organization criteria recruited from outpatient hematology clinics at Stanford Hospital and Clinics (SHC) and Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each participant underwent a history and physical examination, followed by a comprehensive hematologic evaluation, which in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants included complete blood count, red cell indices, review of the blood smear, and assessment of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, iron status and renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional evaluation was obtained by clinical providers as per their discretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>190 participants enrolled and completed the evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve percent of participants had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> in whom there was follow-up information, half normalized their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in response to iron repletion, and half did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five percent of participants had unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> had mildly increased inflammatory markers compared to non-anemic controls, and, at the lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> ranges had relatively low erythropoietin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen percent of participants were categorized as being "suspicious for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>." Thus, even with comprehensive hematologic evaluation, unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is common in older anemic outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>Iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> is also common and can be difficult to diagnose, and frequently the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is not fully corrected with iron repletion </plain></SENT>
