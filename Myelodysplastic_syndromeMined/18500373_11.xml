<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Historically, these patients have fared poorly with intensive conditioning regimens with increased regimen-related toxicity especially involving the heart and lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our institutional experience with a reduced-intensity-conditioning protocol in seven patients with <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> and BM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The preparative regimen consisted of Campath-1H, fludarabine and melphalan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients received matched related marrow and three received unrelated stem cells (two PBSCs and one marrow) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient in this cohort developed grades III-IV GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had grade II skin GVHD that responded to systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and one had grade I skin GVHD, treated with topical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
