<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study establishes the prevalence of Human Gene Mapping 11 (HGM11) chromosome abnormalities in bone marrow (BM) samples from 3,996 patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examination of the karyotype of the stemline in these patients showed that 71.6% had one abnormality and 26.4% had two or more; the remaining 2.1% had two different abnormal clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed 9,431 chromosome abnormalities, of which 56% were structural and 44% numeric, but these figures varied slightly with karyotype complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the HGM11 committee studied published cases with a single chromosome abnormality to identify potential "primary anomalies," we examined the karyotype from our 2,860 patients with a single abnormality in their stemline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 12 of the 34 HGM11 numeric abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except for 21 patients with a +Y, we did not observe two or more patients with any non-HGM11 numeric abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed 91 of the 124 HGM11 structural abnormalities and noted 6 that were not listed by HGM11, and each of these occurred in two or more patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with two abnormal clones, 34% had a t(9;22)(q34;q11), del(20)(q11q13), or +8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 50% of the males with two abnormal clones, one of the clones was -Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We attempted to create a reference table that lists HGM11 abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> and their frequency in our series, the reported associated disorders, and photographs of representative chromosome abnormalities </plain></SENT>
