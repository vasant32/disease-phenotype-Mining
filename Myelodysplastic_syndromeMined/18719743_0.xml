<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that these deletions indicate loss of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes on these chromosomes and until these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes are identified, the functional consequences of these deletions and the molecular basis of these myeloid disorders cannot be completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 44 patients (18 MDS and 26 AML, diagnosed according to WHO classification criteria) at diagnosis, using a four-microsatellite marker panel: an intragenic marker on the 7th intron of gene IRF-1 of the 5q31.1 region and three markers located inside the 7q31.1 region and correlated the LOH with karyotype abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The microsatellites chosen corresponded to chromosome regions frequently deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The samples with Q (peak area) less than or equal to 0.50 were indicative of LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percent of informative samples (i.e., heterozygous) for the intragenic microsatellite in gene IRF-1 and in loci D7S486, D7S515 and D7S522 were 66.6, 73.7, 75.5, and 48.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities by G-banding were found in 36% (16/44) of the patients (2 of 18 MDS and 14 of 26 AML patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a significantly positive association of the occurrence of LOH with abnormal karyotype (P &lt; 0.05; chi-square test) and there were cases with LOH but the karyotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (by G-banding) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that LOH in different microsatellite markers is possibly an event previous to chromosomal abnormalities in these myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
