<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic follow-up of a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) that rapidly evolved to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (M1-FAB type) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow analysis at presentation revealed two chromosomally abnormal clones that shared an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-) and a terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 12 (12p-), but that differed from one another in the localization of a very similar segment of chromosome 17 (i.e. 17q11-12qter) on two clearly distinct karyotypic sites: 2q37 and 17q25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen percent of the metaphases examined bore the 2q+ marker and 38% the 17q+ marker; the remaining cells had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second study carried out 4 months later, at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, revealed that the clone with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype had almost completely disappeared and that there had been an inversion in the ratio of the two abnormal cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the final study, made 1 month before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, the cells with t(2;17) had totally effaced the other clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings seem to indicate that, among the karyotypic changes that occurred in an original clone with 5q- and 12p-, only the t(2;17) could have played a crucial role in the final leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
