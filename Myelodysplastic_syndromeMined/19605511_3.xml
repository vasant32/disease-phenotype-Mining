<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) is the golden standard to assess prognosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this analysis was to study age and gender as interacting variables for individualized prognostication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 897 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with supportive care only were examined in a retrospective multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Cox model was developed to determine the prognostic impact of age and gender on survival and to examine their modulating influence on IPSS results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on main effects and interactions of these variables, we established an individualized age- and gender-adapted scoring system to improve prognostication in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While the risk of a patient in the IPSS is best represented by the values 0 (low), +1 (intermediate-1), +2 (intermediate-2), and +3 (high), these values were found to vary between -1.9 and +3.5 in the same patients when including age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas in low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, male patients were found to have a less favorable survival, a particularly high risk (+3.5) was found in younger (&lt; or = 66 years) high-risk female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The inclusion of age and gender and their respective interactions contribute to improved and individualized prognostication in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
