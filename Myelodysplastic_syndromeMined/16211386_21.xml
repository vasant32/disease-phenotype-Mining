<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these European trial data were reviewed on the basis of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk criteria and the response criteria as recently published by an international working group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the results in a larger cohort of patients and to determine risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data were pooled with some observations from the PCH 95-06 US phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response rate in the 177 patients evaluated (median age 70 years) was 49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median response duration was 36 weeks, and the median survival was 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the data according to sex, age, French-American-British classification, percentage of blasts in the bone marrow, IPSS risk group, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and cytogenetics did not reveal any factor predictive of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 69% of patients benefited, including those with stable disease during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response duration was significantly shorter with increasing risk (according to the IPSS classification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">Haemoglobin</z:chebi> level and neutrophil count showed an inverse correlation to the IPSS classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed a significantly inferior survival for elderly patients (&gt;75 years of age) and for those with high levels of serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) (more than two times the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities according to the IPSS risk criteria showed better overall survival than those with intermediate-risk abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When analysed according to the IPSS risk classification, high-risk patients had worse survival prospects following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> therapy than those with intermediate risk; however, compared to the originally reported IPPS outcomes for high-risk patients, they probably showed better survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During the treatment period, 18% of the patients progressed towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> showed a rather low toxicity profile in this elderly patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> is an active drug for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, even for those older than 75 years with bad prognostic characteristics </plain></SENT>
