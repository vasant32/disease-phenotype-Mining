<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Screening a cohort of 116 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) (84 patients), as well as 232 age- and sex-matched controls revealed a highly significant association of the G-CSF-R_785Lys allele with the development of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as defined by more than 5% bone marrow blasts (9.7% versus 0.9% in controls; P = .001; odds ratio [OR], 12.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-58.9) or an International Prognostic Scoring System score of intermediate-2 or high (13.0% versus 0.9%; P &lt; .001; OR, 14.0; 95% CI, 3.4-85.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis by retroviral transfer of G-CSF-R_785Lys into myeloid progenitor cells of G-CSF-R-deficient mice showed a significantly diminished colony-formation capacity after G-CSF stimulation as compared with cells transduced with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that lifelong altered G-CSF response by the G-CSF-R_785Lys may render individuals susceptible to development of high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
