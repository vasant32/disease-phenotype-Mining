<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reports the results of UD-CBT in 22 adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> following conditioning with thiotepa, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and antithymocyte globulin in 21, with thiotepa, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin in 1, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age was 29 years (range, 18-46 years), and median weight was 69.5 kg (range, 41-85 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA match was 6 of 6 in 1 case, 5 of 6 in 13 cases, and 4 of 6 in 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median number of nucleated cells infused was 1.71 x 10(7)/kg (range, 1.01 x 10(7)/kg to 4.96 x 10(7)/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 20 patients surviving more than 30 days had myeloid engraftment, and only 1, who received the lowest cell dose, developed secondary graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time to reach an absolute neutrophil count of at least 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 22 days (range, 13-52 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median time to platelets numbered at least 20 x 10(9)/L was 69 days (range, 49-153 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (32%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD above grade II, and 9 of 10 patients at risk developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, which became extensive in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients remained alive and disease-free 3 to 45 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year was 53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age strongly influenced DFS (P =.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For patients aged 30 years or younger, the DFS at 1 year was 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results suggest that UD-CBT should be considered a reasonable alternative in young adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> and no appropriate bone marrow donor </plain></SENT>
