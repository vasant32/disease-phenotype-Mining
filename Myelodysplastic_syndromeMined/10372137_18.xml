<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peripheral mobilized parental CD34+ progenitors were isolated and used for the hematopoietic reconstitution after a myeloablative therapy in 23 pediatric patients with various diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen donors were human leukocyte antigen (HLA) three-loci mismatches, 6 donors were two-loci and 3 donors were one-locus mismatches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of T-lymphocytes, a positive selection of the mobilized peripheral CD34+ progenitors using the method of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purity of the CD34+ cells after MACS-sorting was 98-99%, the average number of transplanted CD34+ cells was 14.2 x 10(6)/kg (range 5.4-3.9 x 10(6)/kg) and the average number of infused T-lymphocytes was 1.4 x 10(4)/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to this low T cell number, only a short-term or no prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) was necessary and no GVHD was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant GVHD was only seen in patients after add-back of donor T-lymphocytes, which was performed in some patients for prevention of relapse or in patients who showed a transient mixed chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the B lymphocyte contamination of the isolated CD34+ cells was low in the range of 0.2%, no Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative syndrome was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A primary engraftment was seen in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonengraftment and rejection occurred in three and two patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In four of these 5 patients, a second transplant using purified CD34+ cells from the same donor after an immunological reconditioning regimen resulted in a complete and sustained hematopoietic reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The speed of the immunological recovery was dependent on the number of transplanted CD34+ cells and was more rapid if this number was &gt; 20 x 10(6)/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 23 patients are alive and disease free with a median follow-up of 12 months (range 2-30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was relapse (7 patients), and only one fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the transplantation of megadoses of haploidentical CD34+ cells is a realistic therapeutic option for patients who otherwise have no suitable donor, and an alternative to the use of unrelated cord blood </plain></SENT>
