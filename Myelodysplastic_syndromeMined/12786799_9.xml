<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data collected between October 1998 and December 2001 of paediatric patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and thereafter admitted to the PICU were retrospectively analysed in order to reveal the possible causes and risk factors related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> while in the PICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six PICU admissions were recorded </plain></SENT>
