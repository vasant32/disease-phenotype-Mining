<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, no individual clinical trial has been sufficiently extensive to provide a basis for a decision model for the use of epo in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis included 17 original articles with a total of 205 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who had been treated with epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>33 patients (16%) showed a significant response to treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference in response rate between patients with and without transfusion need was also highly significant (10% v 44%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum level of epo was significantly lower in the responding patients, but this parameter on its own could not be used to identify patients with a favourable response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FAB group (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> versus others), transfusion need and s-epo (&gt;/&lt; 200 U/l) were combined in a model to provide information about the probability of response in different groups of patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and s-epo &gt; 200 U/l, no response was observed </plain></SENT>
