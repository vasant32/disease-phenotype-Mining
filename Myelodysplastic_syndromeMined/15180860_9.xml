<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Point mutations of this gene have also recently been associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further define the frequency and biological characteristics of AML1 mutations, we have examined 170 cases of such diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations within the <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>runt</z:mp>-domain were identified in five cases: one of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and four of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Where multiple time point samples were available, mutations were detected in the earliest samples, which persisted throughout the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the five mutations, one was a silent mutation, two were apparent loss-of-function mutations caused by N-terminal truncation, and two were insertions, I150ins and K168ins, which preserved most of the AML1 DNA-binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both AML1 molecules with insertion mutations were non-functional in that they were unable to rescue haematological defects in AML1-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, activating mutations of N-ras, deletion of chromosome 12p, or inactivation of TP53 accompanied some of the AML1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these observations strongly suggest that one-allele inactivation of AML1 serves as an initial or early event that plays an important role in the eventual development of overt diseases with additional genetic alterations </plain></SENT>
