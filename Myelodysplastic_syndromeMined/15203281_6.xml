<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stromal cell monolayers were characterized as myofibroblasts by the expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin, collagen IV, laminin and fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cord blood cells were plated onto myelodysplastic stromas, a pathologic cell differentiation was observed, indicating altered myelosupportive properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>cDNA array analysis showed that patient stromas expressed increased levels of thrombospondin-1, collagen-I alpha2-chain, osteoblast-specific factor-2 and osteonectin, indicating the presence of increased osteoblast content, as confirmed by enhanced alkaline phosphatase synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the myelodysplastic stroma environment might contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002123'>abnormal hematopoiesis</z:mp> in this pathology </plain></SENT>
