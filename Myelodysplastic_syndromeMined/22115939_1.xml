<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Minichromosome maintenance protein (MCM) 2, which is known to be essential for regulating DNA replication, has proven to have a pro-apoptotic effect in our recent study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, to determine the role of MCM2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and in vitro analysis were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results showed higher MCM2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> than in control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, there was no correlation between MCM2 and Ki67-labeling indices (LIs) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, while MCM2 LIs were significantly correlated with cleaved caspase 3 LIs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro analysis revealed that MCM2 overexpression induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HL60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> bone marrow exhibited higher ratio of MCM2 and cleaved caspase 3 double-positive cells and the ratio was correlated with the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0000221'>leukocytopenia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the up-regulated expression of MCM2 is associated with frequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may have an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
