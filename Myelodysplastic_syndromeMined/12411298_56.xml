<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">Imatinib</z:chebi>, a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, induces major cytogenetic remission (MCR) or complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) in the majority of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, thorough re-evaluation of cytogenetics in a cohort of patients in MCR or CCR demonstrated clonal karyotypic abnormalities in more than 10% of cases, some of which were clinically associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further analysis identified previous exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> as significant risk factors for the subsequent occurrence of abnormalities in Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate if cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but clonal hematopoiesis might be present in other patients in cytogenetic remission, we studied X-chromosome inactivation as a marker of clonality by polymerase chain reaction analysis of the human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor (HUMARA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We find that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> restores a polyclonal pattern in most patients in CCR and MCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, our results are consistent with the notion that targeted therapy of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> favors the manifestation of Ph- clonal disorders in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They indicate that patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> should be followed with conventional cytogenetics, even after induction of CCR </plain></SENT>
