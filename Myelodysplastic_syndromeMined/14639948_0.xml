<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow examination revealed an increase of leukemic blasts with morphological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of mature hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> without antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the patient's general condition and the function of the transplanted kidney were well maintained, intensive therapy for his <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was chosen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dosage of the immune suppressive reagents that were administered to prevent the rejection of the transplanted kidney were reduced during chemotherapy to minimize the adverse effect of immune suppression, and G-CSF was administrated to shorten the neutropenic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Along with these supportive strategies, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>-based induction therapy followed by four courses of intensive consolidation therapy were successfully performed without disturbing his renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that intensive chemotherapy is feasible for post-transplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients when their general condition and transplanted renal functions are well maintained </plain></SENT>
