<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens from 65 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were immunophenotyped using a panel of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A minimum of 1000 cells from representative areas of marrow sections were counted at light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between immunohistological variables and prognosis was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control marrows (n = 23) no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002843'>abnormalities of T cells</z:hpo> (CD3), T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, CD25, TCR gamma/delta) or natural killer cells (CD56, CD57) were seen in the 65 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) 19% of the cases showed increased numbers of B lymphocytes compared with none in the low risk group (RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) (p &lt; 0.0090) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only percentages of B cells above 3% significantly correlated with poor survival (p = 0.0121 for CD19, p = 0.046 for CD22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The deviations in T lymphocyte counts seen in peripheral blood and in bone marrow aspirates could not be verified in bone marrow biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
