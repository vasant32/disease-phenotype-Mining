<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes 4 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> and 1 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> occurring in a cohort of 212 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205851" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">germ-cell tumours</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean cumulative risk of leukaemic complications was 4.7% (SE 2.3) 5.7 years after start of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy, and, compared with the risk in the general population, the relative risk of overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was 336 (95% CI 92-861) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> were detected in a previous cohort of 127 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205851" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">germ-cell tumours</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, and vinblastine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was most probably due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, since other published work has also not revealed an excess of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205851" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">germ-cell tumours</z:e> treated with only <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, and vinblastine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was dose related since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients with leukaemic complications were among the 82 who had received a cumulative dose of more than 2000 mg/m2 etoposide, whereas no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> were observed among 130 patients who had received up to 2000 mg/m2 (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 of the leukaemic patients had balanced chromosome translocations affecting bands 11q23 and 21q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These translocations, and perhaps also other balanced aberrations, seem to be characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> occurring after therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> agents acting on DNA-topoisomerase II </plain></SENT>
