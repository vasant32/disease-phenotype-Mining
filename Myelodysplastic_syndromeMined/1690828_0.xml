<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GM progenitors from two of six patients who grew <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> numbers of colonies in response to conditioned medium + erythropoietin (5637CM + Epo) showed defective responses to either GMCSF and/or IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the recombinant factors tested (IL-3, IL-1, GCSF, GMCSF, MCSF), GMCSF was the strongest stimulator of myeloid clonal growth, inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> numbers of GM colonies from marrow of six patients (two of whom were neutropenic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythroid colonies were low in 5637CM + Epo-supplemented cultures of marrow from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient and remained poor in the presence of any of the haemopoietins. tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Supraoptimal doses (for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow) of these haemopoietins improved colony growth in only one patient (GM colonies in response to IL-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combinations of factors were also largely ineffective at raising myeloid or erythroid colony numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the defective response of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitor cells to growth factors is not amenable to experimental manipulation of recombinant factor levels or combinations </plain></SENT>
