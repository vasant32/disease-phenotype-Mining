<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) remains the most commonly used system for risk classification in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IPSS gives more weight to blast count than to cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, previous publications suggested that cytogenetics are underweighted in the IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we investigate the prognostic impact of cytogenetic subgroups compared with that of bone marrow blast count in a large, multicentric, international patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 2,351 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who have records in the German-Austrian and the MD Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center databases were included and analyzed in univariate and multivariate models regarding overall survival and risk of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed separately for patients treated with supportive care without specific therapy, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-like chemotherapy, or with other therapy regimens (low-dose chemotherapy, demethylating agents, immune modulating agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prognostic impact of poor-risk cytogenetic findings (as defined by the IPSS classification) on overall survival was as unfavorable as an increased (&gt; 20%) blast count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio (compared with an abnormal karyotype or a bone marrow blast count &lt; 5%) was 3.3 for poor-risk cytogenetics, 4.8 for complex abnormalities harboring chromosomes 5 and/or 7, and 3.1 for a blast count of 21% to 30% (P &lt; .01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> categories) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predictive power of the IPSS cytogenetic subgroups was unaffected by type of therapy given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The independent prognostic impact of poor-risk cytogenetics on overall survival is equivalent to the impact of high blast counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding should be considered in the upcoming revision of the IPSS </plain></SENT>
