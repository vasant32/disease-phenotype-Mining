<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to ascertain whether it is possible to detect the evolution of such a clone at an early stage in its development we have studied X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIPs) in three informative females who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0001601'>abnormal myelopoiesis</z:mp> after high-dose chemotherapy and ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one patient transplanted for relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> a leukaemic clone comprising approximately 50% of the patient's myeloid cells was detectable by comparison of peripheral blood granulocyte and T-cell XCIPs when the full blood count and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients transplanted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, XCIP analysis was complicated by constitutively skewed Lyonization patterns, nevertheless a progressive alteration could be demonstrated by serial analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient a difference was detectable 28 months before presentation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other patient, despite evident mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and alterations in her XCIPs over the past 4 years, she has developed no definitive myelodysplastic features and oligoclonality due to stem cell failure cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies show that XCIPs can be used to predict development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in some patients, but the technique is limited by technical variability and frequent constitutional skewing in the haemopoietic system </plain></SENT>
