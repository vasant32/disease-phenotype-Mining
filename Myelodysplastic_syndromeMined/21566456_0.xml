<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comparative study of hypomethylating activities of a series of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleosides</z:chebi>: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> (AC), 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine (DAC) and its α-anomer (α-DAC), 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine (DHAC), 2'-deoxy-5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine (DHDAC, KP-1212) and its α-anomer (α-DHDAC), and of a 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38337">pyrimidone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18254">ribonucleoside</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46938">zebularine</z:chebi>) was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific PCR was employed to detect the efficiency of individual agents on cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B and thrombospondin-1 hypermethylated gene loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall changes in DNA methylation level were quantified by direct estimation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47876">5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi>-5'-monophosphate by HPLC using digested genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle progression and apoptotic markers was used to determine cytotoxicity of the compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was measured using qRT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2'-deoxy-5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine was found to be less cytotoxic and more stable than 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine at the doses that induce comparable DNA hypomethylation and gene reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This makes it a valuable tool for epigenetic research and worth further investigations to elucidate its possible therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
