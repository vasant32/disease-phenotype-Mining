<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two aged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (one aged 91; another 86) were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> and rhEPO over a period of 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that a short-term curative effect was observed and transfusion interval was prolonged in both patients after 4 week treatment with 5 x 0.4 g AMF plus 3 x 6,000 U rhEPO per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reticulocyte count in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA patient returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at first week of treatment and still remained in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level for 4 weeks; leukocyte, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and platelet values in peripheral blood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> patient obviousby increased, the abnormally increased reticulocyte value displayed a decrease trend after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> plus rh-EPO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> plus rhEPO may have a good therapeutic effect for aged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, and its clinical long-term curative effect still needs further evaluation </plain></SENT>
