<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many recent studies have demonstrated that ATG can also be beneficial in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study showed, for the first time, that the cytotoxic effect of ATG can been enhanced by conjugation with saporin-S6, which is one of the most stable and active type-1 ribosome-inactivating proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ATG-saporin-S6 immunotoxin showed a strong cytotoxic effect on five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>- and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>-derived cell lines as well as on activated lymphocytes while sparing non-haematological cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATG-saporin-S6 induced a time-dependent activation of caspase-3/7 in RAJI cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk partially rescued the cells that were treated with ATG-saporin-S6, suggesting that multiple cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways, some of which are caspase independent, play a role in ATG-saporin-S6 toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our experiments ATG increased the complement-independent cytotoxicity of activated lymphocytes by a magnitude of 3-5 logs after conjugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the ATG-saporin-S6 immunotoxin is a promising therapeutic tool for many pathological conditions involving T lymphocytes and T and B neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
