<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been recently shown to selectively target cells with defects in double-strand DNA repair, the aim of this study was to explore the possibility of exploiting defects in DNA repair in leukemic cells using PARP inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Leukemic cell lines were exposed to various PARP inhibitors alone and in combination with non-cytotoxic concentrations of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5' aza-2'-deoxycytidine and/or the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor, MS275, to test for potentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PARP inhibitors, KU-0058948 and PJ34, induced cell cycle arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of primary myeloid leukemic cells and myeloid leukemic cell lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis also revealed that PARP inhibitor sensitivity in these leukemic cells was due to a defect in homologous recombination DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of 5' aza-2'-deoxycytidine failed to increase the cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MS275 potentiated the cytotoxic effect of KU-0058948 and PJ34 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PARP inhibitor-sensitive leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis supported the idea that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors potentiate cytotoxicity by inhibiting DNA repair processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions On the basis of the data presented here, we suggest that PARP inhibitors can potentially exploit defects in double-strand DNA break repair in leukemic cells, paving the way for testing the therapeutic potential of these agents in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
