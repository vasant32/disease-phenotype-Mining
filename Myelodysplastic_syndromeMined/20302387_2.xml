<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>According to the revised WHO classification of 2008, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in &gt; or = 10% of one bone marrow lineage and one cytopenia constitutes the low-risk category of unilineage cytopenia and unilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (UCUD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reclassified, according to WHO, low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from our database and found 126 subjects with these features at diagnosis: 79 patients were categorized as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 23 patients as refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (RN), and 24 as refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (RT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We did not find differences between the three subgroups as regards sex, median age, and cytogenetic aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lower PMN count (0.8 x 10(9)/L) was observed in the RN category, as well as lower platelet count in the RT category (51 x 10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found a lower rate of patients requiring RBC transfusions, during the disease course, in the RT category (45.8%) as compared to RA (62%) and RN (69%) groups (p = 0.05); a lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> at diagnosis in the RT category (20.8%) compared to RA (32%) and RN (43%) categories (p = 0.03); and a higher incidence of hemorrhagic symptoms at diagnosis in the RT category (41.6%) and RN category (26%) as compared to the RA group (5%) (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Application of different scoring systems (Bournemouth and Spanish scores, WPSS) revealed a low OS in high-risk patients within the RT category, compared to RA and RN categories, although unlikely to reflect the consequences of low OS found in the former category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences were also evidenced in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) evolution and overall survival: 7/79 (8%) patients with the RA category evolved to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in a median time of 89 months, whereas 4/23 (17%) of the RN category and 1/24 (4%) of the RT category experienced disease progression, in a median time of 33.8 and 12.8 months, respectively (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The RT category had a lower overall survival (15.9 months) as compared to RA (48.2 months) and RN (35.9 months) categories (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in our study, application of the revised 2008 WHO classification confirmed the importance of separating patients with unilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> for prognostic disease assessment; from our results it seems that the RT category has a worse outcome </plain></SENT>
