<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine accurately the percentage of cytogenetically abnormal peripheral blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>YAC and cosmid probes localized to chromosome 5q were hybridized to interphase nuclei from purified polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) from six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with chromosome 5 deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Per patient, 25-67% of the cells exhibited one signal for the 5q31-q33 specific probes IL-4, D5S207 and c-fms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This percentage was constant for the various probes utilized for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hybridization of the same probes to PMNs from healthy individuals and hybridization of probes (D5S39 and D5S498) localized outside the deleted segments to PMNs of the patients, resulted in 90-95% nuclei with two signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, FACS-purified peripheral blood cells were investigated by FISH using the IL-4 cosmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This demonstrated that the hybridization pattern in monocytes was similar to that observed in PMNs, whereas T-lymphocytes showed no loss of signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that a subfraction of the myeloid progenitor cells have acquired the 5q deletion </plain></SENT>
