<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 49 patients (44%) with clonal chromosome aberrations had survival time (median 29 months) similar to that found in the 62 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow karyotype (24 months, p greater than 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple (greater than 2) abnormalities (17 patients) was strongly associated with poor prognosis, with a median survival of only 7 months (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prognostic information could be attributed to 2 specific abnormalities, del(5q) and -7: Presence of del(5q) as the sole anomaly was associated with long survival (36+ months), whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was a bad prognostic sign (6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> development correlated neither with the number of chromosome abnormalities nor with any particular anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate the prognostic importance of quantifying the complexity of bone marrow chromosome changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also emphasize that different specific abnormalities convey widely different prognostic information in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
