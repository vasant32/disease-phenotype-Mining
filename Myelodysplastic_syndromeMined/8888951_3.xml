<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There seems to be general agreement that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related bone marrow changes are consistent with myelodysplastic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To re-evaluate this assumption more critically, a comparative study was performed on marrow smears and trephine biopsies in 20 patients presenting manifest stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and in 30 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For an assessment of cytological atypias enzyme-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">naphthol</z:chebi> AS-D-chloroacetatesterase) and immuno-histochemical techniques including monoclonal antibodies directed against erythro-(Ret40f) and megakaryopoiesis (CD61), macrophages (PG-M1) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-PCNA (PC10) were applied and staining results determined by morphometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The in situ end-labeling (ISEL) technique was used for the demonstration of cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the HIV-infected bone marrow the frequency of erythroid precursors and macrophages exceeded significantly the corresponding counts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparison with a control group, megakaryocytes were increased in both entities under study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was characterized by a prevalence of atypical microforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The small-sized megakaryocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> revealed striking abnormalities of nuclear-cytoplasmic organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe defects of nuclear lobulation (pseudo-Pelger anomalies) of mature neutrophils or nuclear bridging of erythro-normoblasts were not conspicuous in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whereas the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, no such differences could be found comparing the PCNA-labeling index of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, both parameters were significantly increased in comparison with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the HIV-infected bone marrow alterations of the myeloid stroma were most prominently expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If well defined criteria for the diagnosis of (myelo-) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were applied, our findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> were not in keeping with the assumption of significant maturation defects comparable with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hence, bone marrow lessions accompanying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> should be separated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and should be diagnosed as HIV-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
