<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Initially, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> (TKIs) were developed as targeted therapies that would solely interfere with aberrant tyrosine kinase activation in malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that TKI also exhibit "off-target" effects, that is effects not mediated by the assumed mechanisms of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We and others showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi> exert potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> effects on EGFR-negative myeloblasts from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we undertook a side-by-side comparison of the anti-leukemic efficacy of four different TKI in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides the EGFR inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="114785">erlotinib</z:chebi>, which served as a point of reference, we employed the dual EGFR/HER2 TKI <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49603">lapatinib</z:chebi>, as well as the multikinase inhibitors <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49375">dasatinib</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four drugs had anti-leukemic effects on cell line models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in vitro as well as on malignant blasts from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We explored the biological phenomena underlying this anti-leukemic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since it is established that a therapeutic benefit in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> can be conveyed by induction of cell cycle arrest, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and/or differentiation, we deciphered the individual contribution of these three phenomena to the anti-leukemic action of each of the four TKI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concomitant assessment of the panel of TKI enables us thus to define (and quantify) their differential capacity to impact on the three biological phenomena, and provide further evidence that these mechanisms are not solely explained by on-target effects </plain></SENT>
