<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1997 and 2002, 152 children transplanted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (102), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (23), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (20), and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (7) were enrolled in the study and randomized to receive either early CsA (group 1, N = 72) or conventional CsA (group 2, N = 80), after stratification according to HLA compatibility and disease phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of both grade II-IV and grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (aGVHD), as well as of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD), did not differ between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed also with regard to TRM and RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 8-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of EFS were 56% in group 1, and 46% in group 2 (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Cox model, advanced disease phase, male recipient, older donor, and occurrence of grade III-IV aGVHD predicted inferior overall EFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that early inception of CsA does not improve posttransplantation outcome of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> given UD-HSCT </plain></SENT>
