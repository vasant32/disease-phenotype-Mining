<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To establish specific clonality criteria on XI, human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor assay (HUMARA) was performed on sorted myeloid and lymphoid peripheral blood cells of 21 healthy females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clonality criteria 1 and 2 conferring at least 90% specificity were set based on the ranges and differences of XI number (XIN) describing the ratio of representation of the two alleles in as well as in between reactive myeloid and lymphoid compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spiking experiments indicated that the test identifies clonality reliably when no more than 40-50% reactive cells are admixed </plain></SENT>
