<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities have been detected in 40-70% patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> among patients of different races and from different backgrounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, 351 Chinese adult patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were retrospectively analyzed for their chromosomal abnormalities by karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 237 cases (67.5%) of chromosomal abnormalities, 99 were copy number changes alone (41.7%), 70 were structural abnormalities alone (29.5%), and 68 displayed both of these changes (28.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, the frequency of -5/5q-/del(5)(q13-33) was 5.1% in these Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, which was lower than that in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients of western countries (8.7-23.4%), and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> was only 0.3% in Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal translocations were also detected in 31 cases (13.1%) including 12 rare translocations that have not been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients before </plain></SENT>
