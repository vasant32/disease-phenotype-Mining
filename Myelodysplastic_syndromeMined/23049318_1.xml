<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the promoter region of the perforin gene (PRF1) and it was found that the -398T mutant allele is correlated with lower amounts of protein in circulating CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of the -398C/T polymorphism in the perforin gene in oncohematological patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> treated at the teaching hospital of the Universidade Federal do Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro were invited to participate in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The identification of the polymorphism was achieved by amplification using polymerase chain reaction, digestion using the TaqI enzyme and electrophoresis in 1% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The heterozygous -398C/T polymorphism was identified in 16.7% patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, 40% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, 50% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e>, 14.3% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, 7.7% with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 33.3% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The homozygous mutant allele was identified in one mulatto individual (25%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When Afro-Brazilian and Whites were analyzed together, there was a higher frequency of the -398T allele in patients than in healthy individuals (p-value = 0.0291) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ne patient was homozygous for the -398T allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, further studies should be conducted to assess whether the presence of this polymorphism may be a risk factor for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
