<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Management of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> is difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, we evaluated the safety and hematologic activity of lenalidomide, a novel analogue of thalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three patients with transfusion-dependent or symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> received lenalidomide at doses of 25 or 10 mg per day or of 10 mg per day for 21 days of every 28-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients either had had no response to recombinant erythropoietin or had a high endogenous erythropoietin level with a low probability of benefit from such therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response to treatment was assessed after 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>Neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, the most common adverse events, with respective frequencies of 65 percent and 74 percent, necessitated the interruption of treatment or a dose reduction in 25 patients (58 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other adverse events were mild and infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients had a response (56 percent): 20 had sustained independence from transfusion, 1 had an increase in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level of more than 2 g per deciliter, and 3 had more than a 50 percent reduction in the need for transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The response rate was highest among patients with a clonal interstitial deletion involving chromosome 5q31.1 (83 percent, as compared with 57 percent among those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and 12 percent among those with other karyotypic abnormalities; P=0.007) and patients with lower prognostic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 20 patients with karyotypic abnormalities, 11 had at least a 50 percent reduction in abnormal cells in metaphase, including 10 (50 percent) with a complete cytogenetic remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 81 weeks, the median duration of transfusion independence had not been reached and the median <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level was 13.2 g per deciliter (range, 11.5 to 15.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lenalidomide has hematologic activity in patients with low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> who have no response to erythropoietin or who are unlikely to benefit from conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
