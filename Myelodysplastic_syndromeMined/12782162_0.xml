<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and serum were collected from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cellular immune response against <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> S-antigen (S-Ag) was assessed by proliferation assay, and humoral immune response to S-Ag was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PBLs from the patient exhibited vigorous proliferation against S-Ag, while humoral immune response against S-Ag was not detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBLs from controls did not proliferate against S-Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results provide new evidence that abnormal cellular immune responses against autoantigens may develop in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, thus leading to organ-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, in addition to other systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
