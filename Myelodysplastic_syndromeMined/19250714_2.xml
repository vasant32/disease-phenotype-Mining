<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10) on tendencies of annual mortality rates, corrected and uncorrected to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Starting with the causes with a significant comparability ratio, we calculated the annual ageadjusted rates from 1980 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The comparability ratio was applied to the rates for 1999-2004, obtaining the corrected series for the whole period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This series was then compared with the uncorrected series using joinpoint regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality decreased between 1999 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive diseases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346940" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of illdefined sites</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The tendency of the main causes of mortality has been largely unaffected by the revisions in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10, except in infrequent or less specific diseases </plain></SENT>
