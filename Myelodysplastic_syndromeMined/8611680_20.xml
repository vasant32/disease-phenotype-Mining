<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These chromosomal anomalies represent one of the most common cytogenetic abnormalities associated with these diseases and usually herald a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study two cosmid DNA probes that mapped to 7q22.1 and were known to be separated by approximately 500 kb were identified to flank the proximal inversion breakpoint in a patient carrying a constitutional inversion (7q22.1-34) associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone that encompassed the two cosmids was identified and shown to span the breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization was then used to analyze six additional patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and chromosomal rearrangements of the 7q22 region (three patients had translocations and three carried deletions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint in one of the patients was found to be contained within the same YAC clone that spanned the inversion breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this same interval was determined to be absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients with chromosomal deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this segment of DNA on chromosome 7q22.1 may contain specific gene(s) that have a significant role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
