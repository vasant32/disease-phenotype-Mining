<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test whether the functional impairment of the host bone marrow (BM) microenvironment pre-existing at the time of transplantation could be overcome by the increased content of immature cells in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) when compared with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cobble stone area forming cells (CAFC) were assayed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM and BM after allogeneic BMT and PBSCT after stable engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups were compared by two-tailed t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While BM from 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls contained an average of 778.8 CAFC-d35 per 10(6) low density bone marrow cells (LDBMC, range 453-1231 per 10(6) LDBMC), BM from patients after BMT contained an average of 123.7 CAFC-d35 per 10(6) LDBMC (range 38-257) per 10(6) LDBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BM from patients transplanted with PBSC after myeloablative conditioning contained 128.3 (range 46-305) CAFC-d35 per 10(6) LDBMC (P = 0.89 compared with BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when patients after PBSCT with non-myeloablative conditioning were included (P = 0.62 compared with BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CAFC numbers in patients transplanted in early stages of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> first remission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase) were significantly higher than CAFC numbers in patients transplanted in more advanced stages (P = 0.008) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lowest CAFC numbers were found in two cases of retransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the functional state of the BM microenvironment rather than stem cell dose or source is limiting for the homing and engraftment of immature haemopoietic cells in clinical transplantation </plain></SENT>
