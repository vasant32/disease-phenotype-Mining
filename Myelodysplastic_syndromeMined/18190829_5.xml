<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a nonrandomized controlled clinical study to investigate the role of continuous bladder irrigation in addition to mesna, hydration, and alkalization in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic cystitis</z:e> after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From May 2006, 40 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation received continuous bladder irrigation in addition to the common protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A historical control group of 40 consecutive patients with same inclusion criteria who did not receive bladder irrigation was enrolled from before May 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hemorrhagic cystitis</z:e> occurred in 50% of patients in the no bladder irrigation group versus 32% in bladder irrigation group (P = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic cystitis</z:e> was significantly reduced in the bladder irrigation group (10 vs. 18 days; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In general, continuous bladder irrigation added to mesna, hydration, and alkalization regimens was well tolerated, decreased the complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic cystitis</z:e>, and may be useful in hematopoietic cell transplantation patients </plain></SENT>
