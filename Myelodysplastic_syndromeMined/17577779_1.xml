<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients belonged to the following cytogenetic groups: 3 complex abnormal karyotypes, 7 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes, 1 case with 20q- as sole anomaly and 4 single aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients received in median two cycles of bendamustine (range 1-5) with a dose of 100 mg/m(2) at Day 1 + 2 (repeated after 28 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine of 15 patients had no side effects of the treatment, six patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and epigastric pain as adverse effects of bendamustine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the IWG criteria, no complete remission or reduction of transfusions frequency have been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed no response, one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> died due to progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 11 of 12 patients with initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> (median 68,975 microl(-1), range 24,000-149,000 microl(-1)), a significant reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> was achieved with bendamustine with a median duration of 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, treatment with bendamustine in patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or sAML with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> can result in a significant reduction of leukocytes, but fails to achieve hematological responses or improvement of transfusions dependency </plain></SENT>
