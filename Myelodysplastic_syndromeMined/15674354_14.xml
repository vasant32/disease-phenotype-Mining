<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the data of 283 patients who underwent allo-SCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> that were reported to the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) at 5 and 10 years was 48.8 and 42.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses identified karyotype, FAB classification, and the history of chemotherapy before allo-SCT as significant predictors for OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OS at 5 years was 57% for patients who underwent allo-SCT as a primary treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 54% for those who underwent allo-SCT in remission after induction chemotherapy (P=0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with a poor karyotype was equivalent between the two groups (P=0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although only a randomized controlled trial will be able to establish a definite conclusion, these results do not support the administration of induction chemotherapy for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> before allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
