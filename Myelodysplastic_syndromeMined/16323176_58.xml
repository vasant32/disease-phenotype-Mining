<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used VPA in 58 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) who were too old and/or medically unfit to receive intensive chemotherapy (32 AML secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>], 22 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 4 AML secondary to myeloproliferative syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VPA serum concentrations were 50-100 mug/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients received VPA monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATRA was added later in 13 patients who did not respond or who relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another 27 patients received VPA plus ATRA from the start </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median treatment duration was 93 days for VPA and 88 days for ATRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was only 5% according to International Working Group (IWG) criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> but was 16% when IWG response criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were used, which capture hematologic improvement and stabilization of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These endpoints, which are not necessarily correlated with diminishing blast counts, are relevant for the patients' quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among 23 patients with a peripheral blast count &gt; 5%, 6 (26%) showed a diminishing blast count, and 5 of these had a complete peripheral blast clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Future trials should combine VPA with chemotherapy or demethylating agents </plain></SENT>
