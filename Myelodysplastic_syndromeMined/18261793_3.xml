<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current event-free survival at 1 and 3 years was 47% and 34%, respectively with a median follow-up of 22.8 months in surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The toxicities compared favorably with those seen using reduced intensity conditioning regimens and included grade III/IV GVHD (10%), graft failure (9%), and cumulative treatment-related mortality (28%) </plain></SENT>
