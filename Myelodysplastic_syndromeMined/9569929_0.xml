<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reversion of the mdr phenotype to restore chemosensitivity has been the focus of many studies over the last ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two phase III studies evaluated <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> for obtaining reversion of mdr gene expression in MDSs treated by aggressive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results suggested better response rates and longer survival times in <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi>-treated <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the toxicity of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> warrants further work aimed at developing other mdr phenotype reversion-inducing agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some such agents have proved superior over <z:chebi fb="56" ids="15854">quinine</z:chebi> in in vitro studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reversion of other mechanisms underlying chemoresistance in MDSs is a promising avenue of research </plain></SENT>
