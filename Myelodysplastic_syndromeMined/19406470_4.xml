<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL6) are known to be elevated in two diseases of the elderly age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Authors suppose that one of the possible causes of this elevation could be a difference between these patients and healthy subjects in the frequency of polymorphic variants of the genes regulating IL6 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Scarce and contradictory comparative data are available for MM and to our best knowledge this is the first study on IL6 promoter and IL6 receptor (IL6R) polymorphism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore we determined the Asp358Ala polymorphism of the IL6 receptor gene and the -174 G&gt;C promoter polymorphism of the IL6 gene in blood samples of 102 MDS and 100 MM patients and 99 age- and sex-matched hospitalized controls had been tested for this purpose as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between patients with either disease and controls regarding IL6 promoter/L-6R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Authors therefore assume other mechanisms causing high IL6 levels are not related to either of these polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover authors consider important to propose a hypothesis how elements of signal transduction in iron metabolism might be involved in the development of MM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in elderly age </plain></SENT>
