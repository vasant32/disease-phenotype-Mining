<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ectopic expression of EVI1 (3q26) has been implicated in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> that characterizes this subset of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, lack of EVI1 expression has been reported in several cases, and overexpression of EVI1 was detected in 9% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases without 3q26 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the molecular characterization of seven patients with inv(3)(q21q26), t(3;3)(q21;q26) or related abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EVI1 expression was detected in only one case, and thus ectopic expression of this gene failed to explain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GATA2 (3q21) was found to be overexpressed in 5 of the 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GATA2 is highly expressed in stem cells, and its expression dramatically decreases when erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation proceeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mutations in GATA1 were found in any patient, excluding loss of function of GATA1 as the cause of GATA2 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We report finding molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in patients with 3q21q26 rearrangements in both breakpoints and in the expression pattern of the genes near these breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that a unique mechanism is not likely to be involved in 3q21q26 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
