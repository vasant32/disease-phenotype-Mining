<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have shown down-regulation of genes involved in B-cell development and decreased B-cell precursors (hematogones) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored the possibility that AA, similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, might also be associated with defects in development of lymphoid cells, especially B-cells, by using flow cytometry to assess the presence of hematogones and mature lymphocytes in BM samples from 25 children with AA and 41 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that the percentage of total and early (stage I) hematogones were significantly decreased in AA compared to controls, and they returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> numbers after hematopoietic stem-cell transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates early B-cell lineage involvement in AA, similar to recent findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest dysfunction of an early multilineage progenitor in the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
