<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study using MarketScan Research Data, a large claims database studied patients who received DAC, AZA, or Supportive Care (SC) with at least two claims for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Poisson regressions were used to compare DAC and AZA on post-index number of red blood cell/platelet (RBC/PLT) transfusions and ESA treatment, controlling for age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), time to HMA initiation, number of HMA cycles, and pretreatment RBC/PLT or ESA claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No other adjustment for disease severity was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 48% of the patients were males with a mean age of 73 years (N = 2525) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 37 DAC-treated and 60 AZA-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The length of follow-up did not significantly differ between the DAC- and AZA-treated groups (DAC = 349.2; AZA = 350.5 days); however, the number of days from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis to HMA therapy initiation was longer in the DAC cohort than in the AZA cohort (mean 93.7 days vs. 50.8 days, respectively, p = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both DAC- and AZA-treated patients received similar number of treatment cycles (mean: 4.8 vs. 5.6 in DAC vs. AZA, p &gt; 0.05), with means of 4.6 days per cycle for patients receiving DAC and 7.4 days for those receiving AZA (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following treatment with HMA using Poisson regression analysis, DAC-treated patients had significantly lower use of RBC/PLT transfusions (RR 0.206, p = 0.034) and similar use of ESAs compared with AZA-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Limitations of the study included the small sample size, and the fact that the majority of patients were unspecified regarding their International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk category, which did not allow for accounting for differences in disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients treated with an HMA, treatment with DAC was associated with less frequent transfusions than with AZA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies with the ability to control for disease severity are warranted </plain></SENT>
