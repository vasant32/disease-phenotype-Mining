<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>cGMP levels were monitored in 23 consecutive patients who received TBI as conditioning for BMT, and were compared with the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>cGMP became positive during the aplastic phase after BMT in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nine of these 12 patients, cGMP level decreased during the recovery phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of the nine patients survived, one dying after relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three other patients, the cGMP level continued to increase even during the recovery phase and they died of severe complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>cGMP became positive on day 0 of BMT and during the leukocyte recovery phase after BMT in two and seven of the 23 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients died of severe complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two patients who were negative for cGMP both before and after BMT survived without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that monitoring cGMP from early after BMT may be useful for predicting outcome and that it may be a useful prognostic marker </plain></SENT>
