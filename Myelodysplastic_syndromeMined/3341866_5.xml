<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were placed in categories modified from the French-American-British classification based on percentages of ringed sideroblasts and myeloblasts in the initial bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, 48% (41/85) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> was the most favorable category with longer survival and 13.8% (4/29) leukemic conversions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variables correlating with leukemic transformation included male sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and pseudo-Pelger-HuÃ«t neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two variables had independent predictive value by multivariate regression analysis: a high percentage of myeloblasts and a low percentage of ringed sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Numerous ringed sideroblasts strongly predicts a more favorable course in myelodysplastic patients </plain></SENT>
