<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Parameters which had independent prognostic meaning served to construct a scoring system for survival prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 7 parameters were significant: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, BM cellularity, BM blast percentage, abnormal location of immature precursors (ALIP), <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, dysmegakaryopoiesis and the erythro/myeloid ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They enabled us to predict 42% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient survival (p less than 0.03) and 84% (p less than 0.02) of survival of patients who lived over 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the value of these parameters in individual cases, the patient population had a score ranging from 0 to 13, with a median value of 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median survival of patients with a score less than or equal to 5 was 117, while that of patients with a score greater than 6 was 33 mos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This scoring system, which has been draw from a wide panel of clinical and laboratory parameters, will be verified on prospective studies </plain></SENT>
