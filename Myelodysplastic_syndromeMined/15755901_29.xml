<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Early erythroblasts from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) show constitutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, mature erythroblasts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, but not in RA, display aberrant accumulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ferritin (MtF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release, MtF expression, and gene expression during erythroid differentiation in bone marrow cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas none or few cultured erythroid cells from healthy individuals and RA patients expressed MtF, those from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> patients showed MtF expression at an early stage, when cells were CD34+ and without morphologic signs of erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> erythroblasts that were MtF+ increased further upon in vitro maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significant overexpression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, and proapoptotic Bid and Bax, was seen in freshly isolated cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in erythroid differentiation were also dysregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, GATA-1 expression increased during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythroid maturation, but remained low in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cultures, indicating a block of erythroid maturation at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aberrant MtF expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> erythroblasts occurs at a very early stage of erythroid differentiation and is paralleled by an up-regulation of genes involved in this process </plain></SENT>
