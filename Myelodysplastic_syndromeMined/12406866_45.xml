<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemias</z:hpo> are characterized by ring sideroblasts, that is, red cell precursors with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> iron accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ferritin (MtF) in these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erythroid cells from 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) and 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> (XLSA) were analyzed for the distribution of cytoplasmic H ferritin (HF) and MtF using immunocytochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied 11 healthy controls, 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> without ring sideroblasts (RA), and 7 patients with RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>About one fourth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immature red cells, mostly proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts, showed diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for HF, but very few were positive for MtF (0%-10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar patterns were found in anemic patients without ring sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, many erythroblasts from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> (82%-90% in XLSA and 36%-84% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>) were positive for MtF, which regularly appeared as granules ringing the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Double immunocytochemical staining confirmed the different cellular distribution of HF and MtF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a highly significant relationship between the percentage of MtF(+) erythroblasts and that of ring sideroblasts (Spearman R = 0.90; P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated the presence of MtF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in circulating reticulocytes of 2 patients with XLSA but not in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that most of the iron deposited in perinuclear mitochondria of ring sideroblasts is present in the form of MtF and that this latter might be a specific marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
