<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the frequency of p15 and p16 gene promoter methylation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (APL), and to define its value in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) and treatment prognostication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow DNA obtained from 26 patients with APL at diagnosis and during follow-up was studied with the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial marrow DNA was studied by MS-PCR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>, and disease-free and overall survival were correlated with p15 methylation status at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MS-PCR for p16 and p15 gene methylation has a maximum sensitivity of 10(-4) and 10(-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, 19 patients (73.1%) exhibited p15 methylation, whereas only three patients (11.5%) exhibited p16 methylation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had concomitant p15 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, p16 methylation was acquired in two patients, one during the third hematologic relapse, and the other during transformation into therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients were evaluated serially with MS-PCR for p15 methylation at diagnosis and at follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persistent p15 methylation preceded subsequent hematologic relapses in two patients, and conversion to negative MS-PCR for p15 methylation correlated with prolonged survival in another four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5-year disease-free survival of patients with p15 methylation was significantly inferior to that of patients without p15 methylation (15% v 62.5%; P =.02), and this remained significant in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In APL, p15 but not p16 gene methylation is frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is possible that p16 methylation is acquired during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>p15 methylation is a potential marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> and might be of prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
