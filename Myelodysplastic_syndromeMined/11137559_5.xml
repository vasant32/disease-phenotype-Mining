<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletions of genetic material can result in loss of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes or other translation products that are crucial in maintaining an orderly cell cycle sequence or viability of the apoptotic cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 5 contains many genes that are relevant in hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deletions of chromosome 5 or parts thereof are found frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) where they are associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although abnormalities of chromosome 5 are not commonly detected by cytogenetic analysis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo>, we hypothesized that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of microsatellite markers on chromosome 5 may occur more frequently and likewise influence outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 41 adults with a diagnosis of ALL for LOH by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and correlated our findings with overall survival of patients with and without LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LOH for at least one microsatellite marker was found in seven of 41 patients (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients demonstrated LOH on the long arm of chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three patients, LOH was extended to 5p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A region of minimal deletion which overlapped in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients could be localized between markers D5S410 and D5S436 corresponding to chromosomal location 5q31-33 which is similar to the area of minimal deletion seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of these patients showed involvement of chromosome 5 by cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients with ALL have LOH for gene segments on chromosome 5, especially 5q, more frequently than expected from cytogenetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although, unlike <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, no significant impact on prognosis could be found between patients with and without LOH on chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The current data suggest that 5q abnormalities are not specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and can also occur in patients with ALL </plain></SENT>
