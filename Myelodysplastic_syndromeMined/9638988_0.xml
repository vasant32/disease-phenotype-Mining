<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied the response rate, response duration, survival, and toxicity in 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) treated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) and low dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (ara-C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients diagnosed between October 1993 and May 1995 were treated with ATRA (45 mg/M2/day) for 90 days followed by 90 mg/M2 on alternate day till Day 275; together with Ara-C (10 mg/m2) subcutaneously twice daily for 21 days for a total of 6 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were analyzed for response after 3 cycles of LD Ara-C and at the time of completion of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was recorded at the end of each cycle of Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 6 male and 4 female patients in the age range of 24 to 76 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The morphological diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in 4 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient achieved a complete remission and 1 patient achieved a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients had progressive disease on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died of neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and 1 of resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> while on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient refused further treatment after a minor clinical response and in 1 patient treatment was stopped due to toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This data in a pilot study with a limited number of patient suggests that ATRA in combination with Ara-C has little effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
