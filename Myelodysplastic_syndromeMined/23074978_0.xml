<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were made by a single laboratory using 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were matched to 2 control patients and interviewed concerning previous diseases, work histories, and exposures to potential etiologic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood and bone marrow findings revealed clinical features of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) and myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (MPNs), consistent with hematopoietic disease category of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPN </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A select number of risk factors associated with occupational exposure, nonoccupational exposure, and prior medical or family history of disease were extracted from the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were compared between the case and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 5 study subjects (2 CMML cases and 3 control subjects) were determined to have had some <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, none of the highlighted risk factors associated with nonoccupational exposure to etiologic agents was significantly different among the study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results do not support an increased risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> associated with historical exposures to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
