<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were diagnosed at the University Hospital between January 1987 and July 1992, and were followed until July 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TMDS was identified in 17 of them (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With regard to age and sex distribution no difference was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with and without TMDS (p = 0.43, p = 0.54, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of symptoms at presentation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-TMDS was similar to those observed in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (p = 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> values and platelet counts were similar in both groups of patients (p = 0.45, p = 0.44, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, peripheral white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as blast counts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-TMDS patients were lower than those observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> without TMDS patients (p &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow blast counts in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were higher than the values observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-TMDS patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TMDS occurred predominantly in M2 and M6 FAB types, and was absent in the M3 type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow histology showed no particular feature that could be of diagnostic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remission rates were similar in both groups of patients (p = 0.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The same was true for the probability of disease-free survival and overall survival during the period of study (p = 0.50, p = 0.33, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that: 1) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-TMDS patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> transformation occurs in a more undifferentiated pluripotent stem cell, leading to a dysplastic residual hemopoiesis besides the blast proliferation; 2) the incidence of TMDS in our group of patients did not influence the clinical outcome after treatment of the disease </plain></SENT>
