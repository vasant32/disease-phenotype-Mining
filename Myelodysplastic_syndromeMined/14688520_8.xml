<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that CD8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> or CD34 selection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) reduced the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) after nonmyeloablative stem-cell transplantation (NMSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyze the effect of CD8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> or CD34 selection of the graft on early T-cell reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen consisted in 2 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI) alone, 2 Gy TBI and fludarabine, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and fludarabine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients 1 to 18 received unmanipulated PBSC, patients 19 to 29 CD8-depleted PBSC, and patients 30 to 35 CD34-selected PBSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T-cell counts, and particularly CD4+ and CD4CD45RA+ counts, remained low the first 6 months after nonmyeloablative stem-cell transplantation (NMSCT) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD34 selection (P&lt;0.0001) but not CD8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of PBSC significantly decreased T-cell chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Donor T-cell count was similar in unmanipulated compared with CD8-depleted PBSC recipients but was significantly lower in CD34-selected PBSC recipients (P=0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T cells of recipient origin remained stable over time in unmanipulated and CD8-depleted PBSC patients but expanded in some CD34-selected PBSC recipients between day 28 and 100 after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, whereas CD8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> only decreased CD8+ counts (P&lt;0.047), CD34 selection reduced CD3+(P&lt;0.001), CD8+(P&lt;0.016), CD4+ (P&lt;0.001), and CD4+CD45RA+ (P&lt;0.001) cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T-cell repertoire was restricted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients on day 100 after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation but was even more limited after CD34 selection (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite of the persistence of a significant number of T cells of recipient origin, T-cell counts were low the first 6 months after NMSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, contrary with CD8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the graft that only affects CD8+ lymphocyte counts, CD34 selection dramatically decreased both CD8 and CD4 counts </plain></SENT>
