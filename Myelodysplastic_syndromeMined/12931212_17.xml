<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapy consisted of ATG 40 mg/kg/day daily intravenously (i.v.) for 4 days; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> daily orally for 6 months with levels titrated between 200 and 400 mg/dl; and methylprednisone 1 mg/kg i.v. daily before each dose of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 32 patients treated, 31 patients were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 59 years (range, 28-79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), 10 patients had RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation, and one patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ATG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, and methylprednisone induced complete (N=4) or partial (N=1) remission in five patients (16% of total; RA, two patients; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>, two patients; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Durable complete remissions were observed in three of 18 patients (17%) with RA (N=1) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> (N=2) (12, 41+, and 60+ months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and allergic reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hepatic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, albeit consistently reversible, occurred in 19 and 13% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, an ATG-based regimen can produce durable complete remissions in a subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
