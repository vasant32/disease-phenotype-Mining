<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Supportive care-primarily red blood cell transfusions-remains an important component of their treatment, but exposes patients to insufficient correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e>, and organ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> (for which the role of iron chelation remains debated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment aimed at preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> recurrence should therefore be used whenever possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythropoiesis stimulating agents remain the first-line treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in most lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> without del(5q), whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with del 5q responds to lenalidomide in two-thirds of the cases, but this drug should be used cautiously because profound cytopenias may occur initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment after failure of those first-line therapies are disappointing overall, with many patients eventually requiring long-term transfusions, but encouraging results have been reported with hypomethylating agents and lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selected patients respond to antithymocyte globulins, and thrombopoietin receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> are under investigation in lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
