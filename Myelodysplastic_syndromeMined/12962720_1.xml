<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) show a disturbed production of ROS in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>) in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-primed neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because generation of ROS is mediated by the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase complex, a component of which is flavocytochrome b558, we investigated whether the expression of flavocytochrome b558 in neutrophils from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Neutrophils were stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> and GM-CSF, and plasma membrane expression of flavocytochrome b558 and specific granule markers were assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein levels of the flavocytochrome b558 subunits gp91phox and p22phox in whole neutrophil lysates were detected by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stimulation of neutrophils with GM-CSF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> increased the flavocytochrome b558 plasma membrane expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-induced translocation of flavocytochrome b558 was reduced in neutrophils from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (140%+/-9% vs 180%+/-13%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cell surface expression of markers of flavocytochrome b558 containing granules (CD35 and CD66b) indicated that exocytosis of these granules in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> stimulation was not affected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis demonstrated a decreased protein expression level of the flavocytochrome b558 subunits gp91phox and p22phox in neutrophils from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate both a lower basal protein level and a disturbed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-induced increase in plasma membrane expression of flavocytochrome b558 in neutrophils from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, which together might play a role in decreased ROS production </plain></SENT>
