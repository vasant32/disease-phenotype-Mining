<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation at CpG islands within promoters is increasingly recognised as a common event in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and has been associated with the silencing of important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic therapy using hypomethylating agents has demonstrated clinical effectiveness; the drugs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> have been approved for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We investigated the association between global DNA methylation and clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 134 MDS bone marrow trephine biopsies (BMTB) by immunohistochemistry and compared the results with those from an age-matched group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMTB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded sections using the anti-5-methylcytosine (5mc) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results showed that the 5mc immunostaining score (M-score) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was higher than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and that overall survival significantly correlated with global DNA methylation, age, and IPSS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we found that patients with high levels of methylation had a shorter median overall survival (OS) compared to patients with lower levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These immunohistochemistry results were confirmed by analysing global DNA methylation on LINE-1 sequences using the COBRA method and pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study reports that global DNA methylation detected by immunohistochemistry predicts OS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
