<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently comprising 10-20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, t-MN is relatively resistant to conventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> therapies, and is associated with s ort survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median life expectancy from diagnosis is about 8-10 months in most series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the spectrum of cytogenetic abnormalities in t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> de novo, the frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics, such as a complex karyotype or deletion or loss of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, is considerably higher in t-MN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two distinct groups of patients with t-MN have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The more common subtype, seen in about 75% of patients, typically occurs 5-7 years after first exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> or radiation, is often preceded by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and is frequently accompanied by clonal cytogenetic abnormalities such as the loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or part of chromosomes 5 or 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the P53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene are also common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk is related to total cumulative exposure over time to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, among individuals who develop t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi>, the latency period to the development of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> is often only 1-3 years, antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is rare, and gene rearrangements involving MLL at 11q23 or RUNX1/AML1 at 21q22 are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is now well recognized that APL and other subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with balanced translocations sometimes occur as therapy-related myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (t-MN) in patients who have previously received cytotoxic therapy or ionizing radiation therapy (RT) </plain></SENT>
