<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was given alone for six weeks and then in combination with epo for the following twelve weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight (38%) of 21 evaluable patients showed a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient with a previous response and subsequent failure to epo alone improved after the addition of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were more frequent in patients with less advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, lower endogenous levels of serum-epo and in those with ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response frequency of 38% is higher than in any study of epo as monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients with ring sideroblasts, who respond poorly to epo alone, showed a response rate of 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest a synergistic in vivo effect of granulocyte-CSF and erythropoietin in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
