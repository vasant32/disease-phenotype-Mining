<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the lack of distinguishable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, RTC has often been misdiagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a patient with RTC and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 for whom a bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMNC) gene expression profile was obtained by means of a complementary DNA microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the healthy control subject, the RTC patient differentially expressed 105 genes, of which 88 were down-regulated and 17 were up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern of 16 genes, including those for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> helicase-related protein (RNAHP), heat shock 105kD (HSP105B), interferon-related developmental regulator 1 (IFRD1), cyclin C (CCNC), and DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3), which are usually seen in BMNCs from typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, was observed in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, this RTC patient exhibited an expression pattern distinct from that of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that RTC be classified as a subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> on the basis of its characteristic clinical-hematologic features and specific molecular basis </plain></SENT>
