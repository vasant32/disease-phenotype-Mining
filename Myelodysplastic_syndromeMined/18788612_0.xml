<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) was performed to detect the point mutation of codon 12,13 in N-ras gene and codon 301, 969 in fms gene in adult and aged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 25 ITP patients, N-ras mutation and fms mutation were detected in one each (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations were found in 3 of 8 MDS patients: two (25%) with N-ras mutation and one (12.5%) with fms mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with N-ras or fms gene mutation diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> rather than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
