<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of these cell nests, previously described as "abnormal localized immature precursors" or ALIP, bears a strong prognostic value predisposing patients to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with an increased risk to develop <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to describe and delineate this histological characteristic more precisely, we compared bone biopsies of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, used in these previous studies, with bone marrow biopsies performed for staging procedures in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From this comparison we conclude that immature precursors are readily differentiated from proerythroblasts, myeloblasts and small-sized megakaryocytes, and that they most probably represent precursors of the myelo-monocytic-erythroid series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clearcut increase in their number, mostly resulting in the formation of small clusters, is only found in biopsies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
