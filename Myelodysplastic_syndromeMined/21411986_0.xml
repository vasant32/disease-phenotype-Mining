<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering the additive antileukemic effect of low-dose total body irradiation (TBI), we evaluated the feasibility of combining RIC regimens with low-dose TBI in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RIC regimen combined with low-dose TBI in this study consisted of fludarabine (150 mg/m(2)), intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (6.4 mg/kg), and TBI (400 cGy) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 31 subjects were recruited with a median age of 39 years (range 19-63) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up for survivors of 35 months (range 6.0-54.9), the 3-year overall survival, event-free survival, transplantation-related mortality, and relapse rates were 67.6, 63.2, 20.5 and 11.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
