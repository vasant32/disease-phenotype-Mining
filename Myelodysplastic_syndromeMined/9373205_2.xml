<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we examined the effect of two different stimulants (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) and three cytokines (alphaTNF, G-CSF and GM-CSF), both singly and in combination on granulocyte (RB) in 25 MDS patients compared to seven healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-stimulation showed similar results for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preincubation with cytokines enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-stimulated RB in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and controls, but in patients to a significantly lesser extent when compared to the control group (p &lt; or = 0,05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combinations of alphaTNF + GM-CSF and alphaTNF + G-CSF were highly synergistic in priming <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-stimulated burst in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But again, as with the single cytokine priming this effect was markedly reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared to controls (p &lt; or = 0,05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A specific priming defect for one of the cytokines or a cytokine combination could not be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum alphaTNF levels were measured in 18 and neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) index in 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results did not correlate with variations of the RB in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that reduced alphaTNF, GM-CSF and G-CSF priming of granulocyte RB is a frequent finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
