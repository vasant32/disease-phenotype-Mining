<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the clinical outcomes of 14 patients who had relapsed or refractory marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and underwent high-dose therapy/autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HDT/AHSCT) at the University of Nebraska from August 1992 to August 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients was 48 years (range, 29 to 62 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had relapsed or refractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were three treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> within 100 days of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 138 months, the median duration of failure-free survival is 108 months, and the median duration overall survival is 120 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only two patients have relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">Secondary malignancies</z:e> were seen in three patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, n = 2; gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>. n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that HDT/AHSCT is feasible in patients who have relapsed/refractory marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Approximately one- third of patients can achieve long-term disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
