<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients diagnosed according to standard French-American-British criteria received a loading dose of 0.3 mg/kg per day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> for 5 days followed by a maintenance dose of 0.25 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> twice weekly for 15 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two cohorts: lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (International Prognostic Scoring System risk category low or intermediate 1) and higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (International Prognostic Scoring System risk category intermediate 2 or high) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Modified International Working Group criteria were used for response evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 115 patients enrolled and treated in the study, 67% of patients were transfusion dependent at baseline; median age was 68 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of hematologic improvement (intent-to-treat) was 24 (19%) of 115, including one complete and one partial response in the higher-risk cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hematologic response rates were 13 (26%) of 50 and 11 (17%) of 64 in patients with lower-risk and higher-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major responses were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three hematologic lineages; 16% of RBC transfusion-dependent patients and 29% of platelet transfusion-dependent patients became transfusion independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At data cut off, the median response duration was 3.4 months, with responses ongoing in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">Arsenic trioxide</z:chebi> treatment consisting of an initial loading dose followed by maintenance therapy has moderate activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, inducing hematologic responses in both lower- and higher-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This activity combined with a manageable adverse effect profile warrants the additional study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30621">arsenic trioxide</z:chebi>, particularly in combination therapy, for the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
