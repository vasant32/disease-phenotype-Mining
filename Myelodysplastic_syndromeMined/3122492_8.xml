<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typical alcohol-induced bone marrow changes were found and served to define alcohol-induced bone marrow damage as a nosological entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings took the form of heightened <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> associated with impaired iron utilization, vacuolated proerythroblasts, multinuclear erythroblasts, megaloblasts and iron-containing plasma cells as well as vacuolated precursor cells of the granulocytopoietic series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the differential diagnosis, alcohol-induced bone marrow damage is to be distinguished from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> of the RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alcohol-induced bone marrow damage is reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cell cultures performed in our cases are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, showing that the toxic defect probably does not reside in the stem cell but is more peripheral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cell culture may be a typical feature of alcohol-induced bone marrow damage </plain></SENT>
