<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) with features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and abnormalities of megakaryocytopoiesis often have cytogenetic aberrations of 3q21 and 3q26 bands involving the paracentric inversion [inv(3) (q21q26)] or a reciprocal translocation [t(3;3) (q21;q26)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities frequently cause inappropriate expression of the EVI1 gene located at 3q26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other genes that have been implicated at the rearrangement breakpoint are GR6 and RPN1 (both on 3q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the EVI1 fusion genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with 3q21q26 syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the expression of EVI1 and GR6, and particularly of the fusion genes RPN1-EVI1 and GR6-EVI1 in 9 AML patients with either inv(3)(q21q26) (7 cases) or t(3;3)(q21;q26) (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EVI1 and GR6 were always expressed, as was RPN1-EVI1; GR6-EVI1 was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 8/9 patients, the part of EVI1 retained in RPN1-DEVI1 contained blocks B and C of the PR domain commonly found in the MDS1-EVI1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patient [with inv(3) (q21q26)], only block C was retained: we named this variant fusion gene RPN1-DEVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This patient lacked the micromegakaryocytopoiesis frequently found in 3q21q26 syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that EVI1 activation plays a dominant role in the pathogenesis of the 3q21q26 syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EVI1 expression might occur either as a consequence of rearrangements leading to the formation of different fusion transcripts, such as RPN1-EVI1 and RPN1-DEVI1 or following disruption of the PR activation domain of the MDS1-EVI1 gene </plain></SENT>
