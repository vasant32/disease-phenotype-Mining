<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to investigate the prevalence and spectrum of autosomal <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> in an unselected cohort of patients with known or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by using retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that bone marrow cytogenetic studies (1532 cases) were performed between 2004 and 2012, and an abnormal karyotype was found in 538 cases (35.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 538 cases, 202 (37.5%) cases had autosomal <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> including sole (n = 47, 23.3%), part of two (n = 33, 21.3%) or more (n = 122, 78.7%) anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 22 autosomes were involved, but <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was by far the most frequent, constituting 66.1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> and the highest fraction of those with two or more abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other recurrent sole <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp> included chromosomes 20 (15.0%) and 13 (8.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 13 (12.5%), 18 (8.3%), 20 (6.3%), 17 (7.3%), 21 (5.2%), 5 (5.2%) and 12 (5.2%) were also recurrent in the setting of 3 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow histology and clinical information were reviewed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp>; associated clinical phenotypes were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> (n = 20, 13 were -7), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (n = 12, 11 were -7), RA (n = 9, 3 were -7) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, n = 6, 4 were -7) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sole <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 20 (n = 7, RA 3 case and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> 4 cases) was not detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the presence of at least 1 autosomal <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> was documented in approximately 37.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormal cases, which has potential impact on a more than trivial fraction of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The preponderance of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 implicates a pathogenetic role for haploinsufficiency of genes associated with chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rarity of sole <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> involving other chromosomes other than 7, 20, and 13 suggests that haploinsufficiency involving entire chromosomes is detrimental to cell survival, unless their effect is overcome by the presence of other genetic changes that are often associated with additional chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The observation is consistent with the usually favorable prognostic profile associated with sole <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 20 </plain></SENT>
