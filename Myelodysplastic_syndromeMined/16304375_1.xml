<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transfusion therapy should be tailored to allow adequate oxygenation and optimal quality of life, and may lead to the need for iron chelation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growth factors (erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) may induce long-lasting improvement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels and does not increase the risk for leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Growth factors should be offered to defined subgroups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppression with anti-thymoglobulin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A may be an alternative for younger patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The new immunomodulating compound lenalidomide, CC5013, is very active in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> and is under evaluation for other low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes. "High-risk" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is associated with poor survival and high risk for leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DNA hypomethylating compounds azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> may offer improved long-term outcomes in this group of patients, although there has so far been no effect on survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24017">farnesyl</z:chebi> transferase inhibitors has been evaluated in a series of phase II trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was low, but the majority of responses were CRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, a number of new drugs directed to various biological and genetic targets are entering clinical trials </plain></SENT>
