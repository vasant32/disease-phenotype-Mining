<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 674 patients, 205 were aged 65 years or older, and 56 (8.3%) had another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple malignancy</z:e> was significantly higher in older patients than in younger patients: 44 (21.5%) vs. 12 (2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major hematologic conditions in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple malignancy</z:e> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1707251" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers other</z:e> than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> were the stomach, colon, breast, and esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many of the older patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> was common in the younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multiple malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were synchronous in as many as 20 of the 44 older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was only one such case among the younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 56 patients, nine had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, and one has received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In brief, elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> are likely to have multiple malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If they are synchronous, the patient's prognosis may be adversely affected, because simultaneous management of multiple malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> is not easy </plain></SENT>
