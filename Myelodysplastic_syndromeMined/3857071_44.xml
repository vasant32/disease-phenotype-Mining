<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on sequential determinations of percentages of bone marrow blasts, three patterns of evolution were observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with evolution pattern A (48%) had an apparently stable disease with minimal or no increase in bone marrow blasts </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases in this group, who showed no abnormal localization of immature myeloid precursors (ALIP) at time of diagnosis experienced prolonged survival (median: 43 months), while ALIP positive patients had shorter survival times (median: 14 months), with high probability of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with evolution pattern B (28%) initially had a morphologically stable disease, comparable to cases with evolution pattern A, but showed an abrupt shift from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients (82%) were ALIP positive and a substantial proportion (46%) showed karyotype anomalies at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The abrupt shift to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in these patients was frequently (61.5%) associated with additional cytogenetic anomalies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>From this retrospective study we conclude that evolution in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> shows two important aspects, which seem to be preponderant in determining the course and outcome of the disease: one is the proliferative capacity and resulting growth advantage of the neoplastic clone over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haematopoiesis, as measured by increasing percentages of bone marrow blasts in sequential aspirates; the other one is instability of the clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Unstable clones have a high propensity to further intraclonal changes; they are expressed morphologically by the abrupt increase in bone marrow blasts and cytogenetically by the acquisition of new or additional karyotype anomalies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
