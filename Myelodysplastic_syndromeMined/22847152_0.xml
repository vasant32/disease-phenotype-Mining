<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall survival is compromised by treatment-related mortality (TRM), GvHD, and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretransplant clinical risk indicators in elderly patients qualifying for HCT are highly desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pro-BNP is known as a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with an increasing variety of clinical conditions and frequently used as a routine parameter for organ complications in the allogeneic transplant setting without well-established scientific evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that pre-HCT NT-pro-BNP could aid in identifying elderly patients at risk for early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated NT-pro-BNP values in 177 consecutive patients of ≥60 years HCT (2005-2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 29.4 % of cases, NT-pro-BNP values were within our institute's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (&lt;125 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of different NT-pro-BNP cutoff points by receiver operating characteristics curve for mortality at day +100 revealed no single cutoff value with satisfying specificity and sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The individual outcome of patients with extremely high NT-pro-BNP values was not associated with an increase in mortality or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NT-pro-BNP values of patients succumbing to TRM did not differ significantly from those alive or having died of relapse-median 276 vs. 217 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pre-HCT NT-pro-BNP was of no convincing prognostic relevance for day 100 mortality </plain></SENT>
