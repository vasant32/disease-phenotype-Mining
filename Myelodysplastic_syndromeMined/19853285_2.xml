<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is also known to act as a regulator of cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis of PRDM16 is limited, especially within the developing embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study evaluated the temporal and spatial localization of PRDM16 during early mouse development (embryonic days 8.5-14.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PRDM16 was first detected on E9.5 in a limited number of tissues and by E14.5, was expressed in a broad range of developing tissues including those of the brain, lung, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern is consistent with a role for PRDM16 in the development of multiple tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these studies are the first to characterize the expression of the PRDM16 gene during early murine development </plain></SENT>
