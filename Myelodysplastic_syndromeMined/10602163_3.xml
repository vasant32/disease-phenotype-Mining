<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regulation of its expression is thought to take place through methylation of the DNA in the nonproducing cells, and the methylation inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> induces expression of the sialophorin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report three cases of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in which acquired severe deficiency of the CD43 antigen on the surface of most hemopoietic cells was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) cells from 32 MDS patients and 20 healthy individuals were analyzed by flow cytometry after labeling with an anti-CD43 (DF-T1) monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t), the percentages of CD43(+) PBMC were 3.8%, 6%, and 9.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The deficiency was observed at protein and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level as confirmed by western and southern blot, while analysis of the DNA by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing did not reveal any difference in the gene sequence between the CD43(+) and CD43(-) cells of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is known that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dysplastic population of hemopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to reveal the mechanism of downregulation of the gene in these 3 patients and whether the phenomenon is related to the dysplastic population only or not </plain></SENT>
