<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp>, immunophenotype, osteoblasts differentiative and proliferative property of MSC and colony forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) were measured and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells (MNC) of cord blood were plated onto a feeder layer formed by MSC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient, cells count and CFU-GM production were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the culture-expanded cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients presented a typical fibroblast-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells were positive for SH2 (CD105), SH3 (CD73), Thy-1 (CD90), but negative for CD34 and CD45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After induction, these cells could differentiate into osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their proliferative capacity and CFU-F number were similar to those of MSC from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total cell count and CFU-GM yield in supernatants after culture for 2 weeks were significantly lower than those of control in hematopoiesis supportive experiments in vitro (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the biological characteristics of MSC from bone marrow of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are not different from those of MSC isolated from bone marrow of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, however, their capacity of hematopoiesis support in vitro are significantly weaker </plain></SENT>
