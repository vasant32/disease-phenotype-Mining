<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, expression of these molecules or progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has little been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared expression of these cell-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> molecules and percentages of apoptotic cells in PBMCs between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PBMCs were obtained from 7 MDS patients and 8 age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five out of 7 patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) type, while the other 2 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percentages of PBMCs expressing Fas, Fas-L, and phosphatidylserine as a cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-marker were determined by staining cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labeled anti-CD95 (Fas) antibody, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22885">biotinyl</z:chebi> anti Fas-L antibody, and annexin V, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cells were subsequently analyzed with flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) percentage of Fas-expressing PBMCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group was 55.3 (13.9), whereas the value in healthy subjects was 30.6 (8.8) %, and thus the ratio of Fas positive cells in PBMCs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the mean (SD) of Fas-L expressing PBMCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=5) was 18.4 (12.2) %, which was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.02) than that in healthy subjects (34.4 +/- 8.1%; n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) of apoptotic PBMCs detected as annexin V-positive, non-necrotic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=7) was 23.3 (7.5) %, which was not significantly different from that in healthy subjects (22.2 +/- 7.8%; n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, PBMCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> express high levels of Fas, whereas they conversely exhibit low levels of Fas-L, which may result in prevention of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> signals, and in cell-survival in these cells </plain></SENT>
