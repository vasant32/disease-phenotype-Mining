<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specimens of 51 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were compared with 16 AML and 18 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD34 expressing cells was increased and CD31 expression was decreased in advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VEGFR-2 expression was also raised in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show for the first time that increased numbers of CD133 positive cells are present in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, those cells occasionally seem to contribute to capillary forming units in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
