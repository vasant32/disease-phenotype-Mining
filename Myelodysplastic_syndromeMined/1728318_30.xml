<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rHuEPO was administered subcutaneously 5 days per week at escalating doses (50 to 150 U/kg per day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of treatment was a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) level greater than or equal to 10 g/dL without blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 25 patients treated, 17 were evaluable, most of them with a regular need for transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of these had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (three cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and five of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136085" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monoclonal gammopathy</z:e>) and were exposed to cytotoxic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other nine patients had hematopoietic stem cell disorders (four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, three of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, and two of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> had serum EPO levels inappropriately low for the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, while patients with stem cell disorder showed variable values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Erythroid marrow activity was inadequate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven of eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> responded to treatment maintaining Hb above 10 g/dL without transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median dose of rHuEPO required for correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was 75 U/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In four cases response was maintained with 50 U/kg, three times per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no complete response among patients with hematopoietic stem cell disorder, although transfusion requirement was eliminated or reduced in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> during rHuEPO treatment and required iron supplementation to obtain response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Aggravation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> was observed in two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that: (1) subcutaneous administration of rHuEPO can be effective and safe in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> exposed to chemotherapy and showing inappropriate EPO response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>; (2) this is less likely in hematopoietic stem cell disorders, although favorable responses may be observed in occasional patients; and (3) functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> as a cause of nonresponse to rHuEPO is frequent also in nonrenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
