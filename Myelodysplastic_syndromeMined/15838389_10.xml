<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Myeloproliferative syndromes (MPSs) are clonal stem cell disorders resulting in excessive proliferation of one or more cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since MPSs in children occur much less commonly than adults, one can argue that the biology and the categories of the various pediatric MPSs seem to be different from adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> exists between pediatric MPS and other overlapping conditions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors' objectives were to develop a classification system with a list of disorders relevant to children and to characterize pediatric cases of MPS that were devised according to this classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the predominant proliferating cell lineage, the authors established a classification system for childhood MPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary MPS was classified into granulocytic proliferation--<z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>); monocytic--juvenile myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e>); megakaryocytic--<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> (ET), familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> (TMD); erythrocytic--<z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera, familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>erythrocytosis</z:hpo>; fibroblastic--idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (IMF); eosinophilic--<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206141" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome</z:e> (IHES); and mast cells--<z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary MPS was classified as non-clonal proliferation (eg, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, drugs, toxins, autoimmune, non-hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, and trauma), and these were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Next, the classification system was applied to the patient population at the authors' institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred two cases with primary MPS were identified between 1970 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated for clinical manifestations, blood and bone marrow parameters, cytogenetics, and survival following different treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant proportions of cases of childhood MPS (60%) were unique to the pediatric population and not seen in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common disorders were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> (n = 31), TMD of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> (n = 30), and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (n = 30); the other disorders were rare: four cases of ET, two of IMF, two of IHES, two of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, and one primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>erythrocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast to adults, MPS in children is more frequently treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only available curative option for most of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HSCT was particularly successful in the more recent cases due to more advanced techniques for HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The authors found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases could be easily classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MPS in children is different from adult-type MPS in terms of biology, categories, classification, and prognosis </plain></SENT>
