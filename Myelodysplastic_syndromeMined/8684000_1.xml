<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphological analyses of bone marrow (BM) cytospin preparations showed a significant decrease in the number of blast cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after incubation with IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incubation of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) with IL-2 induced a significant increase in the number of CFU-GM in comparison with untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>gamma-IFN and GM-CSF, but not alpha-TNF were found to be released in significant amounts by the BMMNCs cultured with IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the surface phenotypes of fresh lymphocytes were observed between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After incubation with IL-2, we observed a significant increase in the number of CD3-/CD56+ cells in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood (PB) and BM NK activity against K562 was significantly greater in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after stimulation with IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the clinical usefulness of IL-2 in a large subgroup of patients as it may reduce the percentage of blasts and increase clonogenic capacity and cell-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
