<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight female patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>X-chromosome inactivation patterns were analyzed in peripheral blood granulocytes, T-lymphocytes, single colonies originating from bone marrow progenitors and pluripotent stem cells, using the human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor locus polymorphism assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Granulocytes and progenitor cells were monoclonal in 7/8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immature stem cells showed a non-clonal pattern of X-inactivation and were detectable at diagnosis in the presence of clonal hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T-lymphocyte clonality was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, hematopoiesis may be dominated by a neoplastic clone by virtue of its biological advantage over a residual polyclonal, probably still <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, population of immature stem cells still able to grow in vitro </plain></SENT>
