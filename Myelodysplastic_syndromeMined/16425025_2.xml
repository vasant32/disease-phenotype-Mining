<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here a 71 year-old female presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026998" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB-M1</z:e>) after treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> with Vercyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic techniques showed a complex karyotype, 44,XX,-5,-7,-11,add(11)(q23),-14,+mar,+r </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of several fluorescent in situ hybridizations (FISH) lead to the identification of these complex rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The marker was found to be tricentric, with pericentromeric material of chromosome 7 inserted in the short arm of chromosome 5, resulting in <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 5q and 7q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The derivative chromosome 11 was dicentric and had subtelomeric sequences of 11p on both ends; several copies of the MLL gene were located in two different regions separated by a centromere of chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one cases, including ours, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> with MLL amplification present in hsr or dmin were found in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients shared some characteristics: they were old, they had de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) with a complex karyotype and a short survival, 90% of them having also a del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the simultaneous presence of MLL amplification and del(5q) appears to be a nonrandom association that could be the signature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in elderly patients with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
