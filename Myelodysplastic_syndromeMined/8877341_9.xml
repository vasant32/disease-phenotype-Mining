<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Ramco transferrin assay was compared with the Eurogenetics assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a small clinical study serum samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were analysed, as well as sera from healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analytical performances of the Ramco assay were found to be acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Eurogenetics test however, inter-assay imprecision and the end of run drift were unacceptably high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We were able to confirm that in patients with uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> the concentration of soluble transferrin receptors is higher than in healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e>, the levels of soluble transferrin receptors in serum are slightly, but not significantly, higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurement of soluble transferrin receptors in serum provides a good differentiation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
