<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine the relationships among platelet counts, bone marrow megakaryocyte frequency, and circulating thrombopoietin (TPO) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: TPO levels in 17 children and one young adult with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were measured by ELISA and megakaryocyte frequency was analyzed by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three groups of patients were studied: Group I patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and absent or decreased megakaryocytes; Group II patients had intermittent periods of chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>; and Group III patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls consisted of 77 healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in Group I had markedly increased TPO levels compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their levels were significantly different (p = 0.03) from those of patients in Group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or only mildly increased TPO levels except for one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in Group II had markedly elevated TPO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After their bone marrow and platelet counts recovered from chemotherapy, their TPO levels decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups, a transient increase in platelet count (e.g., after platelet transfusion or anti-D immune globulin therapy) was associated with a moderate decrease in TPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From this study, three conclusions can be made: 1) TPO levels are inversely related to megakaryocyte frequency; 2) platelet counts have a modest influence on TPO level; and 3) TPO levels may have clinical utility in diagnosis and management and further our understanding of the pathobiology of the disorders that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
