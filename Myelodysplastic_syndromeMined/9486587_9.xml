<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the long term outcome and toxicities after the administration of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) to patients with previously treated, advanced, indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients (median age, 55 years) with relapsed or refractory low grade NHL (median disease duration, 2.8 years) were treated with 2-CdA by continuous infusion at 0.1 mg/kg/day over 5 or 7 days every 28 days, for a maximum of 6 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients (9%) achieved a complete response (CR), 8 patients (36%) achieved a partial response, and 12 patients (55%) had no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two patients achieving CR have remained in CR for 46 and 38 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Freedom from treatment failure at 24 months was 32% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 24 months was 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and a cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients have died after a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 3.9-49.2 months) due to progressive NHL (11 patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (2 patients), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 2-CdA is an active agent for patients with previously treated, advanced, indolent NHL and may result in lasting remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Late complications following treatment may include delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp>, fungal, or <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Determination of whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e> that occurred in three patients reported herein were related to treatment with 2-CdA will require further study </plain></SENT>
