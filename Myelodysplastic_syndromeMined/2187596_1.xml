<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one of these, we performed further molecular cytogenetic investigations which showed 1) that this rearrangement led to changes in the dosage and location of both c-ets 1 and c-ets 2 protooncogenes; and 2) that the presence of two 11q + chromosomes did not result from a nondisjunction, but that a second chromosome rearrangement had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The final genetic imbalance resulting from this cytogenetic change involves at least hemizygosity for some sequences on the long arm of chromosome 11, including c-ets 1, plus <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> for the most part of the long arm of chromosome 21, including c-ets 2 </plain></SENT>
