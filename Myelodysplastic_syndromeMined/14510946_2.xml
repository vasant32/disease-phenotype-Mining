<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate whether the IPSS could be used as a prognostic tool in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients aged less than 61 years who were treated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)-like chemotherapy with or without transplantation, and whether the scoring system discriminated between the subgroups of patients who benefit from intensive treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were retrospectively assigned to the IPSS risk categories and compared with the IPSS workshop patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three of 159 patients aged &lt; 61 years, classified as intermediate 1, intermediate 2 and high risk according to the IPSS, received intensive treatment consisting of chemotherapy only (n = 30), chemotherapy followed by either autologous stem cell transplantation (n = 7) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n = 46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After intensive treatment, the median survival was 2.6 years for the intermediate 1 risk group (n = 33), 3.4 years for the intermediate 2 risk group (n = 27) and 0.9 years for the high-risk group (n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the IPSS is an improved scoring system for patients receiving supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the scoring system does not seem to be the best method for predicting outcome after intensive antileukaemic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, intermediate 2 risk patients may benefit from intensive treatment </plain></SENT>
