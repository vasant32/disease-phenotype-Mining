<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study has been performed of 40 bone marrow trephine biopsies from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histology, more specifically the abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP), cytology and karyotype analysis were correlated with survival time and the prognostic value of these factors was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of ALIP proved to be highly significant in predicting the duration of survival (P = 0.007): the presence of ALIP predisposes patients to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with high probability of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), whereas the absence of ALIP carries a better prognosis with more long-term survivors and low probability of transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of ALIP was not correlated with increased mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast with ALIP, the main histological parameter, we were not able to obtain statistically significant prognostic information for cytology (FAB classification) or karyotype analysis (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal chromosomes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that bone marrow biopsy provides useful information for the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and that the presence of ALIP has greater predictive value than the more commonly used parameters deduced from cytology and karyotype </plain></SENT>
