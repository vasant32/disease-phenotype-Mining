<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alternative stem cell sources have been used more recently, such as unrelated donors, non-identical family members or autologous transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis of 1378 transplants reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) addresses the outcome of the varying procedures according to the known risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The estimated disease-free survival (DFS) and estimated relapse risk at 3 years were both 36% for 885 patients transplanted with stem cells from matched siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, age and stage of disease had independent prognostic significance for DFS, survival and treatment-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients transplanted at an early stage of disease had a significantly lower risk of relapse than patients transplanted at more advanced stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimated DFS at 3 years was 25% for the 198 patients with voluntary unrelated donors, 28% for the 91 patients with alternative family donors and 33% for the 126 patients autografted in first complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The non-relapse mortality was 58% for patients with unrelated donors, 66% for patients with non-identical family donors and 25% for autografted patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate of 18% was relatively low for patients with non-identical family donors, 41% for patients with unrelated donors and 55% for patients treated with autologous stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation have emerged as treatment options for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transplantation with an HLA-identical sibling donor is the preferred treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients without an HLA-identical sibling donor may be treated with either autologous stem cell transplantation or an alternative donor transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients younger than 20 years may be treated with an unrelated donor transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients older than 40 years, and probably also patients between 20 and 40 years, may benefit most from an autologous stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
