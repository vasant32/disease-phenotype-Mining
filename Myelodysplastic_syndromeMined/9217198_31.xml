<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> the demonstration of skewed X inactivation patterns in multiple haemopoietic lineages has been taken to indicate a stem cell origin for these groups of diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, stem cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> or selection pressures can also produce skewed X inactivation patterns and might increase with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have therefore used the HUMARA assay to study X inactivation patterns of elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> together with an age-matched control group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clonal pattern (clonal granulocytes and polyclonal T cells) was observed in 23.1% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> women and 63.4% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of X inactivation patterns in purified subpopulations of blood cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results have three significant implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the finding of clonal granulocytes and polyclonal T cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly women is likely to reflect age-related stem cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> or selection pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the demonstration of clonal granulocytes and polyclonal T cells is not a useful diagnostic marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> in elderly women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, our data raise the possibility that clonal blood cell patterns may precede rather than follow mutations which subsequently give rise to myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative phenotypes </plain></SENT>
