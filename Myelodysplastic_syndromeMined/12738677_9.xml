<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incorporation of the B2M covariate into risk assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients added significantly to the power of the IPSS to stratify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients into risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results further document that the 2 objectively measured covariates that display the highest power to predict survival, that is, karyotype and B2M, can alone be used for risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the results must be verified in an independent and comparable population, our data strongly recommend routine measurement of B2M in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
