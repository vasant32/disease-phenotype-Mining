<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ezatiostat is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> analog <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1) inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated 2 extended dose schedules of oral ezatiostat in 89 heavily pretreated patients with low to intermediate-1 risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomized by 1 stratification factor-baseline cytopenia (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> only vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with additional cytopenias)-to 1 of 2 extended dosing schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multilineage hematologic improvement (HI) responses were assessed by International Working Group 2006 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 11 of 38 (29%) red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients had HI-Erythroid (HI-E) response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median duration of HI-E response was 34 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multilineage responses were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was 1 cytogenetic complete response in a del (5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An important trend was the effect of prior therapy on response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 40% HI-E rate (6 of 15 patients) was observed in patients who had prior lenalidomide and no prior hypomethylating agents (HMAs), with 5 of 11 (45%) patients achieving significant RBC transfusion reduction and 3 of 11 (27%) achieving transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A 28% HI-E rate (5 of 18 patients) was observed in patients who were both lenalidomide and HMA naive, with 4 of 8 (50%) patients achieving clinically significant RBC transfusion reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most common ezatiostat-related adverse events were grade 1 and 2 gastrointestinal including: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (45%, 17%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (26%, 7%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (30%, 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ezatiostat is the first GSTP1-1 inhibitor shown to cause clinically significant and sustained reduction in RBC transfusions, transfusion independence, and multilineage responses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The tolerability and activity profile of ezatiostat may offer a new treatment option for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
