<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we describe 15 adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 11 was the sole chromosomal anomaly in eight cases; the remaining seven cases were characterized by +11 in association with other karyotypic aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients ages ranged from 34 to 79 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>12 patients were male; three were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there was no correlation of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 with any specific FAB subgroup [M2 (n = 7), M1 (n = 5), M4/5 (n = 2), M3 (n = 1)] less mature forms predominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunologically, the leukaemic blasts showed a strikingly consistent stem <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> with expression of HLA-DR, CD34 and the myeloid antigens (CD15, CD33 and/or CD13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, two cases expressed the B-cell associated antigen CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of trilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, suggesting the presence of an underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), was observed at presentation in five cases; in another case <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was evident at relapse only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, MLL gene rearrangements were observed in two of four cases characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 as the sole karyotypic abnormality; however, MLL aberrations were not identified in three cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 accompanied by other karyotypic anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients in each subgroup (i.e. those with and without additional cytogenetic abnormalities) achieved a short first complete remission (CR) (mean 8 months) and failed to obtain a second CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only one patient in each <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 subgroup is in a continuous CR for &gt; 34 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> is characterized by a stem/progenitor cell immunophenotype with poor response to standard chemotherapeutic regimens and an unfavourable prognosis </plain></SENT>
