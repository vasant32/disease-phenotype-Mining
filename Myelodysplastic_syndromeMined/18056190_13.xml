<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Promoter hypermethylation of, for example, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor genes, is considered to be an important step in cancerogenesis and a negative risk factor for survival in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>); however, its role for response to therapy has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to assess the effect of methylation status on the outcome of conventional induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sixty patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were treated with standard doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> and 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard prognostic variables and methylation status of the P15(ink4b) (P15), E-cadherin (CDH), and hypermethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> 1 (HIC) genes were analyzed before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty percent of the patients achieved complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CR rate was lower in patients with high WBC counts (P = 0.03) and high CD34 expression on bone marrow cells (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas P15 status alone was not significantly associated with CR rate (P = 0.25), no patient with hypermethylation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three genes achieved CR (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients with CDH methylation showed a significantly lower CR rate (P = 0.008), and CDH methylation retained its prognostic value also in the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation was associated with increased CD34 expression, but not with other known predictive factors for response, such as cytogenetic profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time a significant effect of methylation status on the outcome of conventional chemotherapy in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Provided confirmed in an independent study, our results should be used as a basis for therapeutic decision-making in this patient group </plain></SENT>
