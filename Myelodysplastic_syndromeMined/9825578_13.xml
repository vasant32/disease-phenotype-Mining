<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> have an increased risk of developing subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This co-operative study was conducted to assess the relative risk associated with several candidate factors including age, splenectomy, combined modality therapy and cumulative drug dose including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and nitrosurea derivatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: This study evaluated the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> according to pretreatment variables and therapy modalities among 1659 patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and followed for a median time of 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both case-control and actuarial risk studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age was 34 years (range: 12-83); 53% of patients were splenectomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As to the overall therapy, 348 patients (21%) were given radiotherapy (RT) alone, 375 (23%) chemotherapy (CT) alone (including MOPP, MOPP + ABVD or MOPP + ABVD + lomustine); 936 (56%) received both CT and RT, either as primary or salvage treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall 15-year actuarial risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was 4.2%; the hazard function curve showed two peaks of risk at the 3th and the 8th year from the initiation of therapy and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> beyond the 12th year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was 0.3% after RT alone, 2.8% after CT alone (2.2% after MOPP; 4.4% after MOPP + ABVD + lomustine), and 5.4% in patients given combined modality therapy (10.2% for RT + MOPP; 15.6% for RT + MOPP + lomustine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> occurred after ABVD alone and the risk was low (0.6%) when neither <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925">mechlorethamine</z:chebi> nor lomustine were utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who had received extended radiotherapy including abdomen and pelvis in addition to MOPP showed a significantly higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> compared to those given limited RT + MOPP (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Case-control analysis indicated advanced stage, type and duration (&gt; 8 months) of CT and extension of RT as significant risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared to RT alone, the odds ratio was 5.9 after MOPP + extended RT, and 8 when a lomustine-containing regimen was used, as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither age nor splenectomy were independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; splenectomy was influential only when patients had been given MOPP chemotherapy, as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Both case-control and actuarial analyses indicated that: a) combined modality therapy with MOPP and extensive RT (including abdomen and pelvis), and the use of lomustine added to the leukemogenic risk of MOPP alone; b) programs without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925">mechlorethamine</z:chebi>, procarbazine and lomustine were almost devoid of leukemogenic risk </plain></SENT>
