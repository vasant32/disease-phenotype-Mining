<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 113 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The "response alternating disease natural history," "cytogenetic response," and "hematologic improvement" were assessed by serial bone marrow biopsy, cytogenetic study, and hemogram analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complete and partial remission rates were 17.6% and 3.9% in 51 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in response rate in the different cytogenetic/IPSS/WPSS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall hematologic response (HR) rate was 49.6%, and the HR rate was significantly greater in patients classed as "very high" risk according to the WPSS compared with other patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was higher among patients with HR compared with those without HR (80.9% vs 63.3%, p = 0.046), and the 1-year OS rate among patients classed as being at high risk by each criteria was similar to that of patients classed as being at low risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among patients with HR compared with those without HR was 0.17 (95% CI 0.04-0.69) for high + very high risk group based on WPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the WPSS high-risk group had an increased HR rate compared with other patient groups, and the achievement of HR was associated with a significant increase in OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">Azacitidine</z:chebi> showed similar efficacy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups, even in patients with poor cytogenetics and in high-risk groups </plain></SENT>
