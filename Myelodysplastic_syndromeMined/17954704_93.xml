<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that with new precise methods more cryptic karyotypic lesions can be uncovered that may show important clinical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have applied 250K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays (SNP-A) to study chromosomal lesions in samples from 174 patients (94 MDS, 33 secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> [sAML], and 47 myelodysplastic/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e>]) and 76 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using SNP-A, aberrations were found in around three-fourths of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e>, and sAML (vs 59%, 37%, 53% by MC; in 8% of patients MC was unsuccessful) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously unrecognized lesions were detected in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MC and in those with known lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, segmental <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) was found in 20% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 23% of sAML, and 35% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301355" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS/MPD</z:e> patients, a lesion resulting in copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity undetectable by MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The potential clinical significance of abnormalities detected by SNP-A, but not seen on MC, was demonstrated by their impact on overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>UPD involving chromosomes frequently affected by deletions may have prognostic implications similar to the deletions visible by MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SNP-A-based karyotyping shows superior resolution for chromosomal defects, including UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This technique further complements MC to improve clinical prognosis and targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
