<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms for these associations remain uncertain, although T cell activation seems to be important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) has been detected in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, mostly in regions of the world which are endemic for the virus, and where association of HTLV-1 with rheumatological manifestation is not rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present here the case of a 58 year old man who presented with cytopenias, leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of the skin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo>, and was diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts - <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB 1</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient also tested positive for HTLV-1 by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 8 monthly cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> he achieved a complete hematologic remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following treatment, a second PCR for HTLV-1 was carried out and found to be negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first report in the literature of a HTLV-1-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with severe autoimmune manifestations, which was treated with the hypomethylating factor 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">azacitidine</z:chebi>, achieving cytogenetic remission with concomitant resolution of the autoimmune manifestations, as well as HTLV-1-PCR negativity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HTLV-1-PCR negativity may be due to either immune mediated clearance of the virus, or a potential antiretroviral effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> is known for its antiretroviral effects, although there is no proof of its activity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1512326" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HTLV-1 infection</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
