<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induction chemotherapy (CT) consisted of idarubicine 12 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1 and 2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> 60 mg/m2/12h i.v. for 5d, Ara-C 120 mg/ m2/12h i.v. for 5d (one or two courses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive or not G-CSF (5 microg/kg/d subcutaneously 48 h after the end of CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>52 cases underwent CT alone and 53 CT+G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CT+ G-CSF patients had a significantly shorter duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (8 nu 16d) with a lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and significantly better responses (CR+PR: 74% v 52%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>40 patients entered CR: 17 with CT and 2 3 with CT+G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responders underwent two consolidation courses with the same CT, followed by high-dose Ara-C (2 g/m2 every 12h for 3 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most CRs were clonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At present 21 responders have relapsed (median relapse-free survival 4 5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight responders received an allo-BMT, six are alive in CR 7-57 months post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore allo-BMT only increases the chance of a long survival and possible cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CT+G-CSF did not prolong either CR duration or survival; the growth factor support, however, increased the number of allo-transplantable cases by inducing higher remission rates and improving clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
