<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There have been significant advances in the understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and their contribution to human disease in the last few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of disorders characterized by clonal proliferation of multipotent hematopoietic cells with ineffective hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are often associated with evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) mutations in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes; however, their pattern and their role in etiopathogenesis and disease progression are not yet clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine the frequency and spectrum of mutations of mtDNA in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from Indian subcontinent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The entire <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genome was systematically analyzed in 21 patients and 21 age- and sex-matched controls by gene amplification and direct sequencing using 24 overlapping polymerase chain reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total 37 variations were detected in the entire <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three were reported polymorphisms, one was novel polymorphism, also seen in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and three were variations (mutations), not seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three mutations were detected in four patients (20Â %).These were point mutations scattered over the entire <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genome including tRNAs, rRNAs, and protein genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>COI and COII are not the only spots in mtDNA where mutation may occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> but tRNA, ND1, ND5, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> ribosomal DNA are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vulnerable to such mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These mutations seem to be an important component of molecular pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, its role in severity and disease progression needs to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
