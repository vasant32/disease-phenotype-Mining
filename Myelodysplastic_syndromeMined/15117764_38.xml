<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to enroll previously untreated patients and follow them prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial response rate to fludarabine was 82% (94 of 115 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stem cell mobilization was attempted in 88 patients and was successful in 59 (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall 65 of 115 patients (56%) entered into the study proceeded to autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The early transplant-related mortality rate was 1.5% (1 of 65 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of patients in complete remission after transplantation increased from 37% (24 of 65) to 74% (48 of 65), and 26 of 41 patients (63%) who were not in complete remission at the time of their transplantation achieved a complete remission after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates from transplantation were 77.5% (CI, 57.2%-97.8%) and 51.5% (CI, 33.2%-69.8%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the variables examined at study entry were found to be predictors of either overall or disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 20 evaluable patients achieved a molecular remission on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements in the first 6 months following transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">molecular disease</z:e> by PCR was highly predictive of disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is of concern that 5 of 65 (8%) patients developed posttransplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
