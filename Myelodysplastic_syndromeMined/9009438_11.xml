<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) those refractory to induction chemotherapy and those with so-called secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> have unfavorable prognoses and require innovative therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine allows an increased accumulation of Ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> in leukemic cells and inhibits DNA repair mechanisms; therefore its association with Ara-C and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> results in a synergistic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 1993 to February 1996, fludarabine-containing regimens (FLAG and FLANG) were employed as induction therapy in 51 high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in 22 patients was preceded by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> lasting more than six months; 8 of the 29 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases (28%) were refractory to previous chemotherapy, 9 (31%) were treated for early relapse, 12 (41%) presented poor prognostic factors at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 64 (range 33-76) years and the FAB subtypes were the following: M0 3, M1 5, M2 28, M4 7, M5 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight per cent of patients showed poor prognosis chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FLAG (24 patients) consisted of both fludarabine 30 mg/sqm over 30 minutes followed 4 hours later by Ara-C 2 g/sqm over 4 hours (for 5 days) and G-CSF 300 micrograms/day administered 12 hours before fludarabine, for a total of 5 doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FLANG (27 patients) had a shorter duration (3 days), reduced Ara-C dosage (1 g/sqm) and administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (10 mg/sqm) at the end of Ara-C infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recovery of both neutrophils (PMN &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L) and platelets (Plt &gt; 20 x 10(9)/L) required a median of 16 days from the end of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, 30 patients (59%) achieved CR, 6 (11%) PR and 10 (20%) were refractory; 5 (10%) experienced early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The length of complete response ranged from 2 to 26 months with a median follow-up of 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>De novo and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> registered 62 and 54% CR rates, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eight out of 10 patients refractory to conventional schemes achieved CR (80%) but only 3 out of 10 treated for relapse obtained CR (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FLAG and FLANG showed similar activity and toxicity while proving to be highly effective and relatively well-tolerated treatments for high-risk de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> seemed to be responsive as well, but the presence of an unfavorable karyotype alteration lowered the response rate </plain></SENT>
