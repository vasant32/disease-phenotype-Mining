<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 82) received tipifarnib 300 mg orally twice daily for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (32%) responded to tipifarnib: 12 (15%) complete responses (CRs) and 14 (17%) hematologic improvements; 37 patients (45%) had stable disease (modified International Working Group criteria, 2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 12 CRs, the median response duration was 11.5 months (range, 2.0-21.9 months), the median time to progression was 12.4 months (range, 3.9-23.8 months), and 7 were still alive at time of analysis (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> &gt; 3 years) </plain></SENT>
