<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional numerical chromosomal changes were a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 or 17 in two cases each and a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 19 in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) diagnosed according to the FAB nomenclature as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) in two cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEBt) in two cases, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (MPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) type M1, M2, or M4 in a period of 2 to 30 months after initial diagnosis, except one patient with RAEBt who died within 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented with ANLL-M2 at time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of disease consisted of mild cytoreduction and/or substitution of platelets or red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> received an allogeneic bone marrow graft and relapsed after 33 months with ANLL-M1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment results for overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were poor, and survival was short, lasting from 1 to 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 1 to 37 months (median duration, 6.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies in two cases revealed neither a BCR rearrangement nor a translocation of the ABL protooncogene, as observed in Ph1-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, an i(17q) anomaly seems to identify a distinct subgroup of mostly myelodysplastic and, less frequently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> that progress rapidly to ANLL, respond poorly to chemotherapy, and are associated with short survival after transformation </plain></SENT>
