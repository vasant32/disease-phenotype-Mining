<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>New diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of the various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are proposed, and a detailed description is given of the features that may help define <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are described: (1) refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), (2) RA with ring sideroblasts, (3) RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), (4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), and (5) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> 'in transformation' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the main distinguishing features of these conditions is the proportion of blast cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The morphological features of the blast cells that are of diagnostic importance have been redefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In RA, with or without ringed sideroblasts, there are fewer than 1% of blasts in the PB and fewer than 5% in the BM; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> is defined as having between 5% and 20% of blasts in the BM and fewer than 5% in the PB; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (a newly defined category) will be considered when any of the following features is present: (i) more than 5% of blasts in the PB, (ii) 20-30% in the BM, and (iii) the presence of Auer rods in granulocyte precursors in BM or PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In accordance with these newly defined criteria, it is now proposed that over 30% of bone marrow blasts will suffice for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in any of its forms (M1-M6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proposed descriptions of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> should facilitate the interpretation of data emerging from cytogenetic and bone marrow culture studies and the search for features of possible prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the new category, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation, may throw light on the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
