<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The FAB group has defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> in adults but direct application of this categorization to children has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, to outline the natural history of the disease better we have retrospectively analysed case reports and series published in English between 1982 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study also included children with juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e>) and <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (Mo7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>340 patients were described in 27 publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean presentation age was 5.91 (SD 5.04) years, and 34.9% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Constitutional alterations were described in 68 (20%) where <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) predominated and were associated with a significantly longer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients progression to higher forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was noted in 61 (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic anomalies were detected in 59% of 227 children, and in 67 it was to Mo7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Amid those with Mo7, the clinical and laboratory characteristics as well as survival, closely followed their FAB type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the treatment options described, survival was significantly higher in those who underwent bone marrow transplant (BMT) (46.9%; P = 0.00021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JMML</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e>) not receiving a BMT, time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was shortest in those best described as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e> (absence of constitutional and karyotypic derangement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and elevated Hb F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that children with constitutional abnormalities survive longer, Mo7 disorders are clinically and morphologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and should not be grouped into a single entity and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JCML</z:e> may have biological differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, BMT remains the treatment of choice for those with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, as intensive chemotherapy is no better than supportive measures </plain></SENT>
