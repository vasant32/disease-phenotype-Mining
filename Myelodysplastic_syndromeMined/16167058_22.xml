<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the clinical characteristics of 96 patients (pts) with a mean age of 48 years, and analyzed the molecular parameters that could predispose to t-leuk/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Hematological malignancies</z:e> were the most common primary (53%), followed by breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> (30% combined) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean latency until the development of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was 45.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics was abnormal in 89% of pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FLT3 internal tandem duplications were found in six of 41 (14.6%) pts, of whom four had an abnormal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of drug metabolism and disposition genes showed a protective effect of the CYP3A4 1*B genotype against the development of t-leuk/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, whereas the CC genotype of MDR1 C3435T and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> oxidoreductase1 codon 187 polymorphism were both noncontributory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis using fluoresceinated PCR with ABI sequence analyzer demonstrated that 41% of pts had high levels of MSI in four or more of 10 microsatellite loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry demonstrated reduced expression of MSH2 and MLH1 in 6/10 pts with MSI as compared to 0/5 of pts without MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, genetic predisposition as well as epigenetic events contribute to the etiology of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
