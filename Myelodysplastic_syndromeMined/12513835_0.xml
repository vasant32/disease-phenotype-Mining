<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD41 immunoenzyme labeling (alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase APAAP)/DNA in situ end labelling (ISEL) double stained techniques was used onto plastic cold embedded bone marrow sections in 29 MDS patients to analyse the proliferative and apoptostic characterization of megakaryocytic line with 14 cases of iron deficient diseases (IDA) as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the mean CD41 positive cell number in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group was (26.23 +/- 8.18) /mm(2) with a count of (15.64 +/- 7.11) /mm(2) in control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The small-micro megakaryocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is much higher than that in IDA group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a positive co-relation between total megakaryocytes and small-micro megakaryocytes count in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (r = 0.702, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some megakaryocytes distributed abnormally around trabecula and formed small or large clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic megakaryocytes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> occupied 4.40% and 9.32% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD14 positive cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> apoptotic cells respectively (p &gt; 0.5 comparing with control) </plain></SENT>
