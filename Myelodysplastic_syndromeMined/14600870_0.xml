<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to estimate the significance of a dynamic study performed during the first 20 minutes after autologous (111)In-oxinate-platelets injection in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> immune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hypotheses were tested: a) dynamic study indicates the place of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet sequestration</z:e>; b) dynamic study reflects the quality of platelet separation and labelling procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-nine persons were investigated: 25 with shortened platelet life span (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), and 14 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet life span (6 healthy subjects and eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>--<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet blood count on the day of platelet labelling, general yield of platelet labelling (GYL), differential yield of platelet labelling (DYL), platelet life span, dynamic study with initial platelet accumulation in the liver (IPAL), sequential static study for determining the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet sequestration</z:e> index (SI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet sequestration</z:e> site (SS) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two types of labelled platelet kinetics were determined in both groups of patients: IPAL &lt; 20% and IPAL &gt; 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference in GYL and DYL was noted between the patients with IPAL &lt; 20% and IPAL &gt; 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was registered in platelet blood count, life span, SS and SI between the two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both yields of platelet labelling were higher in the group with IPAL &lt; 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between IPAL and platelet SI, or between IPAL and platelet SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic study with (111)In-platelets cannot predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet sequestration</z:e> site in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients, but it is a useful and sensitive method of platelet labelling procedure quality control </plain></SENT>
