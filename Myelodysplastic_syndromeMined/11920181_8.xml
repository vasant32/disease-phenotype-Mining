<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected at different time intervals after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes were analyzed for informative markers by immunocytofluorimetric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Natural killer cells derived from patients undergoing matched unrelated donor transplant were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of phytohemoagglutinin and IL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The natural killer cell clones were analyzed for cytolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the nine patients analyzed undergoing transplantation from sibling donors, the majority of peripheral blood lymphocytes during the first 80 d after BMT were represented by T lymphocytes, while in the 15 patients undergoing matched unrelated donor transplant natural killer cells consistently outnumbered T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the early phases after transplantation, most CD56+CD3- natural killer cells did not express CD16 which was expressed at later intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the inhibitory receptors specific for HLA-class I molecules showed that CD94/NKG2A, specific for HLA-E, unlike <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, was expressed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> natural killer cells including the early appearing CD16-negative ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Killer inhibitory receptors of the Ig superfamily were expressed late and in low percentages after transplantation and were always coexpressed with CD94/NKG2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Natural killer-cell clones efficiently lysed the HLA-class I-negative cell lines K562 and 721-221 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Natural killer-cell populations or clones isolated from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host-disease</z:e>, failed to lyse donor or recipient derived phytohemoagglutinin-induced lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that (1) recipients of matched unrelated donors transplants exhibit a high proportion of NK cells (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NK cells express CD94/NKG2A while the HLA-class I-specific inhibitory receptors of Ig superfamily appear at later stages and (3) donor NK cells do not lysed donor or recipient target cells </plain></SENT>
