<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Light density marrow cells were incubated during culture with Ara-C concentrations ranging from 10(-4) M to 10(-12) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After counting, colonies were cytospun and cells within the colonies examined for alkaline phosphatase positivity and expression of HLA-DR antigen, as indices of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monocytes/macrophages were also enumerated in colonies using the monoclonal antibody CD14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, 10(-4) M to 10(-6) M Ara-C caused significant reduction in CFU-GM colony formation compared with control (no Ara-C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In no instance did colony numbers increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ara-C across the dose curve had no effect on myeloid differentiation markers in any of the groups studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, percentages of CD14 positive cells in colonies were not altered by exposure to Ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using this clonogenic model, these data suggest that Ara-C does not induce differentiation of CFU-GM stem cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects or patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
