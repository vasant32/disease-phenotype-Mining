<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 1994, platelet transfusions (10 units three times per week) were unable to maintaining her platelet count over 10 x 10(3)/ microliter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was decreased to 3.9 g/dl as a result of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from early <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At one-hour after posttransfusion corrected platelet count increment (1-hour CCI) was slightly low, as 14 x 10(3)/microliter/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 24-hour posttransfusion CCI (24-hour CCI) and the (24-hour CCI)/(1-hour CCI) ratio were markedly low, as 0.5/microliter/m2 and 0.36, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-HLA antibody was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ineffectiveness of platelet transfusion was suspected to be highly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her spleen had been gradually increased in size since the first clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She underwent both subtotal gastrectomy and splenectomy, while receiving 40 units of platelet transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After splenectomy, the 1-hour CCI and the (1-hour CCI)/(24-hour CCI) ratio markedly improved (76 x 10(3)/microliter/m2 and 0.79, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0011514'>Cutaneous bleeding</z:mp> halted and there have been no further episodes, despite less frequent platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first report in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> and CCI were improved by splenectomy in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
