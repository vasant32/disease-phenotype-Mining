<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination showed septal and lobular <z:mp ids='MP_0011164'>panniculitis</z:mp> composed of lympho-histiocytic infiltrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the clinical and histopathological findings, the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (EN) was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> were temporarily effective, but the eruptions had repeated to the present, and 16 months later, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, 6 months later, he developed a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and edematous fresh red-colored nodules on his neck, arm and upper trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically, a diffuse, dense, dermal infiltrate of neutrophils was seen, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e> (SS) was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SS is known to develop in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and EN is one of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e> that occur in conjunction with hematoproliferative disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SS evolving from recurrent EN and the simultaneous occurrence of SS and EN have been reported in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our case, we suggest that some mediators such as cytokines associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> might have first induced EN, and then, as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> developed, they were replaced by others that caused SS </plain></SENT>
