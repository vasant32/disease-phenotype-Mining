<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a 36-year-old female patient who was first presented in 1997 because of 'Pseudo Pelger-Huet' neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining blood and differential counts were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the erythroid and granulocytic series, no increase in blasts, and a karyotype with complex aberrations involving chromosomes 7, 13, 20 and 22 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the next few months, the patient was closely monitored and considered as candidate for bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, blood counts remained stable without occurrence of significant cytopenias or an increase in blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Re-examinations of the bone marrow in 1998 and 1999 disclosed identical results compared to that obtained in 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a total follow up of 6 years, the patient is still in good health with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts and persisting 'Pseudo Pelger-Huet' neutrophils </plain></SENT>
