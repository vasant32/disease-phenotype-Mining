<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three of 446 patients received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) with a median CD3 dose of 1 x 10(7) cells/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (n = 9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 9), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received DLI for persistent disease (n = 8), disease relapse (n = 17), progressive disease (n = 12), low donor chimerism with disease (n = 11), or low chimerism with disease remission (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of the 53 patients (32%) are alive with a median follow-up of 30 months; 5 are in complete remission (CR), 2 are in partial remission (PR), and 10 have stable or progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of 53 patients (17%) developed grades II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 48 patients receiving DLI for treatment of disease, 7 achieved CR and 5 PR, with an overall response rate of 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of 16 patients who received DLI for chimerism had increases in donor chimerism leading to sustained engraftment, whereas 10 eventually rejected their grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, DLI is a potential treatment strategy, with acceptable toxicity, for patients with persistent, relapsed, or progressive disease after nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
