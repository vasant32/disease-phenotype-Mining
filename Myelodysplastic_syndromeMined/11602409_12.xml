<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to assess whether a range of mechanisms may be altered within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The effects of diffusible factors produced by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stromal layers on hematopoietic cells were studied by comparing the ability of media conditioned (CM) by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stroma to regulate migration of target <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow CD34+ cells across 5 microm transmembranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of CM to stimulate hematopoietic cells was also assessed: changes in membrane polarity of KG-1a cells on exposure to stroma CM were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, contact-mediated interactions between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow CD34+ cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stroma were studied: survival of allogeneic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow CD34+ cells on live and glutaraldehyde-fixed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and myelodysplastic stroma after 24h of co-culture was measured using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52304">7-aminoactinomycin D</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether hematopoietic cell survival on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stroma was related to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> within the stromal microenvironment, intracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> levels, both constitutively and induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-a were measured within live stromal cells by FACScan analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi> stained cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ability of CM from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stroma to regulate short-term migration and activation of hematopoietic cells was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean percentage of apoptotic CD34+ cells (13+/-11%) adherent to glutaraldehyde-fixed myelodysplastic stroma was higher than on paired fixed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stroma (11+/-10%) (n=6, p=0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Constitutive mean levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in myelodysplastic cultures (9.5+/-2.1) were greater than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stromal cultures (4.9+/-0.6; n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, following treatment with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-a, the mean value for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in myelodysplastic stromal cultures was unchanged (fractional change=0.99+/-0.56), compared with an increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stroma (fractional change=1.6+/-0.1, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> levels, proportion of apoptotic CD34+ cells and percentage of CD14+ stromal cells [mean 8%, range 0-37% (myelodysplastic); mean 1.3%, range 0-5% (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of stromal function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are likely to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in origin: altered matrix molecules and changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> within stromal cells may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>abnormal survival</z:mp> and development of hematopoietic cells within the myelodysplastic marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
