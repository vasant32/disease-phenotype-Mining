<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>These suggested practice guidelines are based on extensive evaluation of the reviewed risk-based data and indicate useful current approaches for managing patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four drugs have recently been approved by the FDA for treating specific subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: lenalidomide for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with del(5q) cytogenetic abnormalities; azacytidine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> for treating patients with higher-risk or nonresponsive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> for iron chelation of iron overloaded patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, because a substantial proportion of patient subsets with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> lack effective treatment for their cytopenias or for altering disease natural history, clinical trials with these and other novel therapeutic agents along with supportive care remain the hallmark of management for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of thrombopoietic cytokines for management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> needs further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, further determination of the effects of these therapeutic interventions on the patient's quality of life is important.(116,119,120,128,129) Progress toward improving management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> has occurred over the past few years, and more advances are anticipated using these guidelines as a framework for coordination of comparative clinical trials </plain></SENT>
