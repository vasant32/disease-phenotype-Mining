<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effects of various cytokines on the marrow microenvironment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>Autoimmunity</z:hpo>, i.e. a reaction of autologous T lymphocytes against components of the marrow is also operative in a proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The negative feed-back loop that controls <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)α levels in healthy individuals is apparently disrupted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> due to auto-amplification signals involving TNFα and interleukin (IL-32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-32 mRNA levels in primary adherent cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> are 14- to 17-fold higher than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> with low TNFα levels, express IL-32 at only 1/10 the level observed in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Damage in the microenvironment may occur secondary to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, which may also lead to accelerated shortening of telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is, indeed, true for hematopoietic cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow, but telomere length in marrow stroma does not differ from that in age-matched healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the stroma shows functional aberrancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stroma-derived signals facilitate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in clonal hematopoietic cells but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus while stroma dysfunction is likely due to signals derived from the hematopoietic clone rather than being intrinsic, it does affect clonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or survival, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, signals exchanged between both compartments could serve as targets for therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
