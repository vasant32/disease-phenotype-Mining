<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effectiveness of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with a PCR-negative graft we analyzed a series of consecutive CBF-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1997 and 2006, 18 patients aged&lt;60 years were referred under a diagnosis of CBF-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival (EFS) and complications of ASCT were then assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 18 patients received ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median observation period was 4.4 years </plain></SENT>
