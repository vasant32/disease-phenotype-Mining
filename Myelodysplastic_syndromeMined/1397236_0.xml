<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI has been compared with needle marrow biopsy in 22 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A fairly good concordance has been demonstrated in 79% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in 5 patients MRI revealed that bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was not generalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore in elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, MRI of the spine allows the quantification of bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> with a greater accuracy than bone marrow biopsy and this may be useful for monitoring the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
