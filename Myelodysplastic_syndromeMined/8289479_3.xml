<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum EPO concentration is variable among patients for a given <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 19 non-transfusion-dependent patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 13 healthy elderly control subjects in an attempt to define the factors governing variability in serum EPO and to further characterise the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum EPO concentration was appropriate for the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in 15/19 MDS patients, and was positively related to mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (MCH), and percentage highly fluorescent reticulocytes (% HFR), but not to absolute or percentage reticulocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the observed/predicted ratio for serum transferrin receptor (TfR) concentration was low in 12 of 19 MDS subjects, no relationship to <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, reticulocytes or serum EPO was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum TfR was positively correlated with WBC and platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum TfR was higher in patients with sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> than refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Standardized in vivo p50 was positively correlated to red cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3 diphosphoglycerate</z:chebi> concentration, although this was not the only factor influencing the oxygen dissociation curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that effective erythroid output responsive to endogenous EPO drive in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is positively related to MCV, MCH and % HFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum TfR may not represent effective output as precisely as % HFR, but may be proportional to total marrow erythropoietic activity </plain></SENT>
