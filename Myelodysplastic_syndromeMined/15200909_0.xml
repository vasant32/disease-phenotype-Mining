<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 7 patients with myeloid diseases, 6 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 4 males and 3 females, aged 51 - 74, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome specimens were prepared by direct method and/or short-time culture of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping was performed by R banding technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two kinds of probes (20q subtelomere probe and 20q12 unique sequence probe) were used in dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the seven patients, 4 died and 3 survived by the end of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients survived for 6 months (case 1), 7 months (case 2), 17 days (case 4), and 28 days (case 5) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis showed that one of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes 20 was lost and substituted by one or two small metacentric isochromosomes smaller than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 20 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was proved to be ider(20)(q10) del(20)(q11q13), i(20q-) in six cases by D-FISH assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: i(20q-) is a novel and rare recurrent chromosome abnormality which may be specifically associated with myeloid diseases and poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
