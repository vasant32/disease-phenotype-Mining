<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight of the 153 patients (25%) showed progression to ANLL, 63 (41%) died during the myelodysplastic phase due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and three (2%) received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that the FAB-classification, in vitro growth pattern and differentiation, and cytogenetics had a predictive value for ANLL development and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Bournemouth score was predictive only for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most predictive for the development of ANLL were in vitro growth pattern and maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in vitro growth progressed to ANLL in 6% of the cases, in patients with hypoplastic or leukaemic growth 32.5% developed ANLL (P less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ANLL incidence in patients with normally differentiated in vitro colonies was 14.5%, compared with a 52% incidence in cases showing no in vitro cell maturation (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of growth pattern and differentiation revealed an ANLL incidence of 4.2% in cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth and differentiation, and 60.4% if the in vitro growth and/or differentiation was abnormal (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro maturation was the only parameter predictive for ANLL development in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From our data it is concluded that the predictive value of in vitro bone marrow culturing in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can be increased by including in vitro maturation as a distinct parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The in vitro prognostic data can be important in selecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients for intensive chemotherapy or BMT </plain></SENT>
