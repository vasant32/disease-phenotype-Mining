<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience in 526 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated by ASCT to determine whether difficult stem-cell harvests predict for an increased risk of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Autologous peripheral stem cells were initially mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) alone (n = 334), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and G-CSF (n = 166), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and G-CSF with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Difficult harvests were those that required more than 5 days to collect enough stem cells and those that required additional attempts with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus G-CSF (n = 52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were then treated with high-dose chemotherapy alone and observed for outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up time for surviving patients of 69 months, 20 patients developed t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, for an actuarial incidence of 6.8% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretransplantation characteristics, including age, diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, bone marrow involvement, prior radiation therapy, prior exposure to chemotherapy, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase at the time of ASCT, disease status, and method of stem-cell mobilization, were then analyzed with respect to the subsequent development of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By multivariable analysis, prior exposure to radiation therapy, four or more chemotherapy regimens, and more than 5 days of apheresis needed to harvest enough stem cells were identified as independent risk factors for t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bootstrap analysis confirmed these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that identifiable pretransplantation factors predict for t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after ASCT </plain></SENT>
