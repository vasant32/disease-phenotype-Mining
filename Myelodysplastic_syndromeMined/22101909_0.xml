<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the imaging appearances of mass-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000240'>EMH</z:mp>), to identify those features that are sufficiently characteristic to allow a confident diagnosis, and to recognize the clinical conditions associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0000240'>EMH</z:mp> and the relative incidence of mass-like disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 44 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0000240'>EMH</z:mp>; 12 of which (27%) had focal mass-like lesions and formed the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 6 male and 6 female subjects with a mean age of 58 years (range 13-80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients underwent CT imaging and 3 of the 12 patients had undergone additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The imaging characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> lesions in the study group were analyzed and recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's clinical presentation, including any condition associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo>, was also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten of the 12 (83%) patients had one or more masses located along the axial skeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 patients with axial masses, 9 (90%) had multiple masses and 7 (70%) demonstrated internal fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (80%) had paraspinal masses and 4 patients (40%) had presacral masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (70%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 12 patients had a clinical history available for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A predisposing condition for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> was present in 10 patients and included various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> (5 cases; 45%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (4 cases; 36%), and marrow proliferative disorder (1 case; 9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient had no known predisposing condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mass-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> most commonly presents as multiple, fat-containing lesions localized to the axial skeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When these imaging features are identified, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> should be strongly considered, particularly when occurring in the setting of a predisposing medical condition </plain></SENT>
