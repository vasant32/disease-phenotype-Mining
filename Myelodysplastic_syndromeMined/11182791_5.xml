<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 237 individuals initially suspected to have been significantly exposed to radiation during or in the immediate aftermath of the accident, the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> radiation sickness (ARS) could be confirmed in 134 cases on the basis of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 54 patients suffered from cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034535" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">radiation syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>) to varying degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 28 patients who died from the immediate consequences of accidental radiation exposure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemopoietic syndrome due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> was the primary cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> only in a minority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 16 of these 28 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, the primary cause was attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This report describes the characteristic cutaneous sequelae as well as associated clinical symptoms and diseases of 15 survivors of the Chernobyl accident with severe localized exposure who were systematically followed up by our groups between 1991 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> of varying severity, showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000958'>xerosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>cutaneous telangiectasias</z:hpo> and subungual splinter <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100764'>lymphangiomas</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001221'>epidermal atrophy</z:mp>, disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022593" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratoses</z:e>, extensive dermal and subcutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> with partial ulcerations, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentary changes</z:hpo> including radiation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023321" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lentigo</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, no cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> have been detected so far in those areas that received large radiation exposures and that developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022593" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratoses</z:e>; however, two patients first presented in 1999 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo> on the nape of the neck and the right lower eyelid, areas that received lower exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, two patients were lost due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in 1995 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in 1998, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other radiation-induced diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013238" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dry eye syndrome</z:e> (3/15), radiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> (5/15), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000217'>xerostomia</z:hpo> (4/15) and increased FSH levels (7/15) indicating impaired fertility were also documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study, which analyzes 14 years in the clinical course of a cohort of patients with a unique exposure pattern, corroborates the requirement for long-term, if not life-long, follow-up not only in atomic bomb survivors, but also after predominantly local radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
