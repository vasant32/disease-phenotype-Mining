<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide is an amino-substituted analog of thalidomide with potent immunomodulatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug has been widely used for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) associated with 5q-abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common side effects are cytopenias, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE STUDY: We report a clinical observation of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (AIHA) due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175816" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cold agglutinin disease</z:e> (CAD) that developed 11 days after initiation of lenalidomide treatment in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who relapsed after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CAD was diagnosed by the presence of hemolytic variables and cold agglutinin detected in patient's plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antibody screen, which was performed at 37 Â°C, was negative throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The direct antiglobulin test was positive only for complement (C3d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings supported the diagnosis of CAD associated with lenalidomide administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other causes of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860218" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ABO incompatibility</z:e> and infectious etiologies were ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rituximab therapy in conjunction with daily plasma exchange decreased the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> and transfusion requirement in our case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In addition to warm AIHA, lenalidomide use can also be associated with development of CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rituximab given in conjunction with plasma exchange can be effective in treating CAD in this setting </plain></SENT>
