<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among previous reports, the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo (IMSUT) has reported remarkably favorable results of CBT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> as a single-institute experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present multicenter prospective study was to assess the safety and efficacy of CBT performed precisely according to IMSUT transplantation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, either lacking an HLA-identical sibling/HLA-matched unrelated donor or requiring urgent transplantation were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditioning consisted of total body irradiation (12 Gy), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> were used for GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in 26 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in 4, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in 3; 12 patients were in first complete remission, and the others were in advanced stages at the time of CBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients achieved engraftment, and the cumulative incidence of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 45% (95% confidence interval, 28%-62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 46.2 months in 16 surviving patients, the 1-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 15% (95% confidence interval, 5%-30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Causes of nonrelapse mortality were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n = 4) and graft failure (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall and disease-free survival rates were 51% (95% CI, 34%-68%) and 42% (95% CI, 26%-59%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the IMSUT CBT procedures can safely provide a high disease-free survival rate in patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
