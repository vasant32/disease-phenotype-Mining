<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a study of children with Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi> may have been associated with a higher risk for developing second malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (SMNs) including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the incidence of SMNs in children and adolescents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1996 and 2010, the Dana-Faber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute ALL Consortium conducted three consecutive multicentre trials for children with newly diagnosed ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first (1996-2000), high risk patients were randomly assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (30mg/m(2)/dose, cumulative dose 300mg/m(2)) preceded by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi> (300mg/m(2)/dose, 10 doses), or the same dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi>, during induction and intensification phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subsequent trials (2000-2005 and 2005-2010), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> high risk and very high risk patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> preceded by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases of SMNs were collected prospectively and were pooled for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency and 5-year cumulative incidence (CI) of SMNs were determined for patients who had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Among 553 patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi> (1996-2000, N=101; 2000-2005, N=196; and 2005-2010, N=256), the number of SMNs observed by protocol was 0 (median follow-up 9.6years), 0 (median follow-up 5.2years), and 1 (median follow-up 2.1years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only SMN was a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, which developed in a patient with MLL-rearranged ALL 2.14years after initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year CI of SMNs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 553 patients was 0.24Â±0.24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: In a large population of children with high risk ALL who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi> as a cardioprotectant drug, the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> was a rare event </plain></SENT>
