<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied CD7 and TdT expression in the CD34+ myeloid blast cell population in 55 bone marrow samples of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD7 and/or TdT were detected in 38 out of 55 patients (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD7 expression was not related to other bad prognosis data but conversely, we found an association between TdT+ CD34 myeloblasts and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients according to the International Prognostic Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CD7 and TdT may help to establish the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and, TdT expression also seems to be a useful marker in distinguishing risk groups </plain></SENT>
