<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are common adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with progressive cytopenia and a risk of evolving into currently incurable <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until recently, the only treatment was bone marrow transplantation, but, over the past few years, a new therapeutic approach based on immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IMiDs belong to a therapeutic class whose progenitor is thalidomide, a synthetic derivative of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> that was initially used because of its sedative and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> properties but was then withdrawn because of its teratogenic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IMiDs represent a major advance in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> at different disease stages, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349641" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">5q minus syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> with the 5q deletion, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, relapsing or unresponsive high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and relapsing indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical databases and conference proceedings were searched to identify articles and clinical trials that have investigated or are investigating the use of IMiDs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An important part of their in vivo efficacy is attributed to their immunomodulatory properties because they potentiate the immune response by restoring dendritic cell function and inhibiting T-cell regulatory activity, which leads to the activation of T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells by increasing the production of interleukin-2 and interferon gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IMiDs are characterized by antitumoral and antiangiogenic activities, and they also induce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide and its derivative lenalidomide have been proposed for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> because of their action on the immune mechanisms that appear to play an important role in the pathophysiology of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This article examines the pharmacology and molecular action of IMiDs and the evidence of their efficacy in treating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in different risk classes </plain></SENT>
