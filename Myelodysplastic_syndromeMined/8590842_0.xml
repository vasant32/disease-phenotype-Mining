<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antisense oligonucleotides were used to determine the role of the BCR-ABL gene in the proliferation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) clonogenic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856536" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Philadelphia chromosome positive</z:e> cells were obtained from eight <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients at diagnosis (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase = 7; accelerated phase = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells were incubated with synthetic antisense 18-mer oligonucleotides complementary to the two different junctions b2a2 or b3a2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The type of junction (b2a2 or b3a2) was previously determined by RT-PCR techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells incubated for 12 to 14 hours with or without sense oligonucleotides served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After incubation with oligonucleotides, the cell DNA synthesis was analysed by flow cytometry using the BrdUrd/DNA method and the cell plating efficiency in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six of the seven patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, there was a significant inhibition of CFU-GM production which was only 68.4 +/- 19%; (p &lt; .01) of that found in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The S phase index, which depends upon the percentage of S phase cells as well as the fluorescence intensity, was 48 +/- 29% (p &lt; .01) of the control values for the seven patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, for the only <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patient in accelerated phase, antisense oligomers had no inhibitory effect on either the production of CFU-GM or the number of S phase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In improving the specificity of oligomers, it might be useful for gene-targeted anti-leukemic therapy and/or bone marrow purging </plain></SENT>
