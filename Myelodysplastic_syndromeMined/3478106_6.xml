<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new hematopoietic cell line derived from a patient with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-negative myeloblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> arising from a form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cell line, designated TMM, consists of immature cells with the morphological characteristics of young myeloblasts and grows in suspension culture with a doubling time of about 30 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By cytochemical analysis the cultured cells were positive for acid phosphatase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were free of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen as well as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further phenotypic analysis revealed the expression of the myelomonocytic-specific antigen Leu-M1 and receptors for the Fc portion of IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Partial differentiation of these cells could be induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi> and resulted in cells of the myeloid series expressing lysozyme and receptors for the C3b complement protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was 46,XY, lacked the Ph1 chromosome, and displayed no abnormalities at the light microscopic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No rearrangement of the bcr-c-abl gene complex was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This cell line should be useful for studying an important type of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population constituting Ph1-negative myeloblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, arising in this instance from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, as well as for studying differentiation and proliferation of human pluripotent stem cells </plain></SENT>
