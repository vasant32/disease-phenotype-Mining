<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Treatment was adapted to the activity and extent of disease, with regular evaluation by an interdisciplinary team accompanied by group education about <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The estimated median survival time was 21.7 years (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 15.60-27.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients died; 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> and/or its treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors of survival at diagnosis were age &gt;50 years (hazard ratio [HR] 5.45, 95% CI 1.97-15.02), kidney involvement with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> (HR 5.42, 95% CI 1.76-16.68), and lung involvement (HR 3.75, 95% CI 1.26-11.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At some stage, 142 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CYC), usually as daily CYC plus mesna as uroprotection, 50 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45924">trimethoprim</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9332">sulfamethoxazole</z:chebi>, and 45 received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was achieved in 83 of the 155 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One or more relapses occurred in 99 patients after either complete or partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CYC-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cystitis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> occurred in 17 and 11 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A cumulative dose of 100 gm or more of CYC resulted in a 2-fold greater risk of CYC-related morbidity than with lower CYC doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> occurred in 41 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An interdisciplinary approach to the care of 155 WG patients resulted in a median survival of &gt;21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Kidney or lung involvement at diagnosis was predictive of a &gt;3-fold higher mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although CYC remains essential in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>, it was administered as briefly as possible and under close surveillance to avoid permanent CYC-related morbidity, which can lead to serious therapeutic problems in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> relapsing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
