<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A predominance of N-ras mutations has been found in the bone marrow DNA of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, increased levels of plasma DNA have previously been observed in patients suffering from various malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present work we have investigated, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), point mutations of the N-ras gene in the DNA of plasma, blood cells and bone marrow of 10 patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The different ras mutations detected in five cases were always present in the plasma DNA while sometimes absent in the DNA of peripheral blood cells or bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This indicates that a bone marrow biopsy or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> does not necessarily contain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the malignant clones involved in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma could thus prove to be an easily accessible and useful material for detection and monitoring of myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
