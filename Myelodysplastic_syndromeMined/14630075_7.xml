<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to test the significance of the endothelial growth in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, two in vitro assays are presented in this study: a long-term culture method for the detection of human bone marrow endothelial colonies (CFU-En) (77 patients) and a human primary model for the evaluation of the influence of a "bone marrow conditioned medium" on the formation of new vessels in a culture matrix ("angio-kit assay") (in 24 out 77 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The in vitro growth pattern of bone marrow CFU-En as well as the generation of microvessels in the angio-kit system was increased in RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in comparison with controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of large islands, formed by clusters of endothelial cells, unable to generate microcapillaries was also reported </plain></SENT>
