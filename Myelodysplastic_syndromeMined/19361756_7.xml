<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this transplantation setting, factors associated with hematopoietic recovery have not been defined completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of donor and recipient characteristics on neutrophil and platelet engraftment after unmanipulated HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study group comprised 348 patients who underwent unmanipulated haploidentical blood and marrow transplantation to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> at a single institution between 2002 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors correlating with neutrophil and platelet engraftment posttransplantation were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved an absolute neutrophil count ANC of 500/microL in a median of 13 days (range, 9 to 49 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 348 patients, 331 (95.11%) achieved an untransfused platelet count of &gt; 20,000/microL in a median of 16 days (range, 7 to 356 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the amount of CD34(+) cells infused (CD34(+) cells &gt;or= 2.19 x 10(6)/kg recipient weight vs &lt; 2.19 x10(6)/kg recipient weight; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.695; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.361 to 2.112; P &lt; .0001), and disease stage (advanced vs early; HR = 0.724; 95% CI = 0.577 to 0.907; P = .005) were independently associated with increased risk of platelet engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that low numbers of CD34(+) cells in allografts and advanced-stage disease may be critical factors associated with delayed platelet engraftment after unmanipulated haploidentical transplantation </plain></SENT>
