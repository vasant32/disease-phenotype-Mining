<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective single-center study of 73 untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients we assessed whether CFU-C growth patterns were of prognostic value in addition to established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities were classified as qualitative (i.e. leukemic cluster growth) or quantitative (i.e. strongly reduced/absent growth) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients (53%) showed leukemic growth, 26 patients (36%) had strongly reduced/absent colony growth, and 12 patients showed both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis the presence of leukemic growth was associated with strongly reduced survival (at 10 years 4 vs. 34%, p = 0.004), and a high incidence of transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (76 vs. 32%, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified leukemic growth as a strong and independent predictor of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (relative risk 2.12, p = 0.03) and transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (relative risk 2.63, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative abnormalities had no significant impact on the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CFU-C assays have a significant predictive value in addition to established prognostic factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
