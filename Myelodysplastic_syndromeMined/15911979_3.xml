<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The measurement of functional and phenotypic P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> by flow cytometry is suitable for cells in suspension, and is particularly appropriate for blood and bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a functional assay for P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi>, an assay for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> accumulation, and an assay to measure P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> levels using the MRK16 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our protocols include the use of an anti-CD45 antibody for the identification of leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protocols described in this chapter were designed for use in studies accompanying UK Medical Research Council Trials of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>Myeloid Leukaemia</z:mpath> and High Risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic Syndrome</z:hpo> (&gt;10% blasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These assays are performed in more than one UK Centre, and hence each assay has been subjected to rigorous reproducibility testing </plain></SENT>
