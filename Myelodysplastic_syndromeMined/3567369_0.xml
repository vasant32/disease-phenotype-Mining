<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of low concentration of ARA-C on the growth of marrow cells that were obtained from 6 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and from 11 cases of ANLL by using the in vitro culture system for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulo-monocyte precursors (CFU-GM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At ARA-C concentrations equal to or higher than 1 ng/ml cell growth was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At ARA-C concentration of 0.1 ng/ml cell growth was slightly affected, but colony number and colony cell composition were identical to control cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This experiment did not support the hypothesis that ARA-C can induce leukemic cells to recover any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth patterns but confirmed that even very low ARA-C concentrations can inhibit or slow down leukemic cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
