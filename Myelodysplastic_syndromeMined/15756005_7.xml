<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We aimed to assess the role of CEBPalpha mutations in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and their cooperating mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Mutational analysis of CEBPalpha with direct sequencing for each PCR product was done on matched bone marrow samples obtained from 50 adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at diagnosis and at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cloning analysis was used to determine the allelic distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CEBPalpha mutations were identified in four patients at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts and three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> transformation, three patients retained the identical mutant clones as their initial diagnosis, three acquired the mutations, and one lost CEBPalpha mutation when she gained FLT3/ITD mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together, seven patients had CEBPalpha mutations throughout the disease course; four patients had NH(2)-terminal mutations resulting in a frameshift and truncation of the protein, three of them had two different mutations either on the same alleles or on different alleles, two had missense mutations, and one had a deletion in the basic region leucine zipper domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except for one with coexistence of N-ras mutation, no sample harbored cooperating mutations with FLT3 or N-ras genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CEBPalpha mutations had no influence on the time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> progression or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that CEBPalpha mutations play a role in a subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mutation status was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, exhibiting identical clone, clonal change, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> during the progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
