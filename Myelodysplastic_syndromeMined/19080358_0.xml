<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) display a very diverse pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated prognostic factors and survival rate in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA) diagnosed according to French-American-British classification and evaluated the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multi-center study on diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA was conducted to characterize the clinical features of Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The morphological criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA were first standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data of 307 MDS-RA patients collected from Shanghai, Suzhou and Beijing from 1995 to 2006 were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curve, log rank and Cox regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of 307 MDS-RA cases was 52 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of 2 or 3 lineage cytopenias was 85.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormal karyotype occurred in 35.7% of 235 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 165 cases (70.2%) in the good IPSS cytogenetic subgroup, 44 cases (18.7%) intermediate and 26 cases (11.1%) poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IPSS showed 20 (8.5%) categorized as low risk, 195 cases (83.0%) as intermediate-I risk and 20 cases (8.5%) as intermediate-II risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year survival rates were 90.8%, 85.7%, 82.9%, 74.9% and 71.2% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fifteen cases (4.9%) transformed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (median time 15.9 months, range 3 - 102 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lower white blood cell count (&lt; 1.5 x 10(9)/L), platelet count (&lt; 30 x 10(9)/L) and cytogenetic abnormalities were independent prognostic factors by multivariate analysis, but age (= 65 years), IPSS cytogenetic subgroup and IPSS risk subgroup were not independent prognostic factors associated with survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Chinese patients were younger, and had lower incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities, more severe cytopenias but a more favourable prognosis than Western patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The major prognostic factors were lower white blood cell count, lower platelet count and fewer abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The international prognostic scoring system risk group was not an independent prognostic factor for Chinese <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
