<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and its treatment with steroids are identified as main risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a single-center, prospective cohort study of patients undergoing allogeneic SCT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo>, we determined the incidence of hip AVN necessitating total arthroplasty (severe adverse event) and performed risk factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 255 patients were followed for an observation period of at least 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen potential risk factors including age, recipient and donor gender, underlying disease and disease stage, conditioning therapy, human leukocyte antigen match, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, and immunosuppressive medication were tested in univariate and multifactorial nominal logistic and Cox proportional hazard analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe adverse events occurred in eight patients (4-year cumulative incidence rate 6.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multifactorial analysis revealed a diagnosis other than <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and steroid intake as main risk factors (chi model 31.6, P=0.0005; chi diagnosis 11, P=0.001; chi steroid 6.8, P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The demonstrably strong influence of diagnosis was steroid independent (steroid intake in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> comparable to non-<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We repeated the analysis in 103 patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (70 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, 13 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and 20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo>), excluding 152 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multifactorial analyses revealed female gender (of both recipient and donor) as risk factors for AVN in addition to steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relative AVN risk for female compared with male donor transplantation was 8.7 (P=0.01); relative AVN risk for female compared with male recipient transplantation was 4.3 (P=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis and gender are steroid-independent risk factors for severe hip AVN after allogeneic SCT </plain></SENT>
