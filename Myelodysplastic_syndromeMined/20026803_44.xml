<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Older patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) have limited treatment options because of the lack of effectiveness and the toxicity of available therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of the hypomethylating agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> as initial therapy in older patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, phase II study, patients older than 60 years who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (ie, &gt; 20% bone marrow blasts) and no prior therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> 20 mg/m(2) intravenously for 5 consecutive days of a 4-week cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response was assessed by weekly CBC and bone marrow biopsy after cycle 2 and after each subsequent cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients continued to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> until disease progression or an unacceptable adverse event occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (mean age, 74 years) were enrolled and were treated with a median of three cycles (range, one to 25 cycles) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expert-reviewed overall response rate was 25% (complete response rate, 24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response rate was consistent across subgroups, including in patients with poor-risk cytogenetics and in those with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall median survival was 7.7 months, and the 30-day mortality rate was 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common toxicities were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">Decitabine</z:chebi> given in a low-dose, 5-day regimen has activity as upfront therapy in older patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, and it has acceptable toxicity and 30-day mortality </plain></SENT>
