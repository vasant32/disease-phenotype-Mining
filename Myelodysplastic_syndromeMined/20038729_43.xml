<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The current classification systems of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), including the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), do not fully reflect the molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular characterization may predict clinical outcome and help stratify patients for targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic therapy using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, a DNA hypomethylating agent, is clinically effective for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the association between DNA methylation and clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We screened 24 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> for promoter CpG island methylation of 24 genes and identified aberrant hypermethylation at 10 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then performed quantitative methylation analyses by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> pyrosequencing of the identified genes in 317 patient samples from three independent studies and assessed relations between methylation and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In an initial training cohort of 89 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, methylation frequencies of individual genes ranged from 7% to 70% and were highly concordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we defined a methylation z score based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genes for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that patients with higher levels of methylation, compared with patients with lower levels, had a shorter median overall survival (12.3 v 17.5 months, respectively; P = .04) and shorter median progression-free survival (6.4 v 14.9 months, respectively; P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This methylation prognostic model was independent of age, sex, and IPSS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Applied to two validation cohorts (228 patients), this model was confirmed as an independent prognostic predictor for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although methylation at baseline did not correlate with clinical response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, we observed a significant correlation between reduced methylation over time and clinical responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DNA methylation predicts overall and progression-free survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
