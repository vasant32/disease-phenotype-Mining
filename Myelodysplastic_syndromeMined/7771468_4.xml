<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A family is described in which three, and possibly four members, namely, the propositus, two paternal uncles, and possibly his paternal grandfather, developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) after the age of 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> resembles <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases which are commoner in older age, rather than the previously reported familial cases most of whom have been children or young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The three affected members had megaloblastoid bone marrows with an increased proportion of bone marrow blasts and developed progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> without leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The propositus showed a dramatic but temporary response to GM-CSF therapy but eventually became unresponsive with a marked increase in bone marrow reticulin and reduction in hemopoietic elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Affected members had no recognisable bone marrow cytogenetic abnormality but the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and similarity in clinical features suggest an inherited genetic defect which predisposes to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
