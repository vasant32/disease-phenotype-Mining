<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Standard Giemsa, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) and reticulin stains were used for morphologic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify the cell lineage precisely, chloroacetate esterase staining and an indirect immunoperoxidase technique using mouse monoclonal antibodies CD15, CD68, HLA-DR, and rabbit polyclonal CD3 and UEA-1 (lectin) was developed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded bone marrow biopsies (BMB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical assessment permitted accurate identification of dysplastic features such as mononuclear and binuclear megakaryocytes, Pelger-Huet neutrophils, and binuclear erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional bone marrow histologic and immunohistochemical features observed were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of immunohistochemical staining in various cell lineages, megakaryocytic emperipolesis, alteration of bone marrow microarchitecture, intravascular clusters of hematopoietic cells, and the types of benign lymphoid aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nature of abnormally localized immature precursors (ALIP) was discerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three types of clusters of immature cells were found that were difficult to distinguish on Giemsa and H&amp;E <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, these were erythroid aggregates (n = 18); megakaryocytic aggregates (n = 4), and immature granulocytic and monocytic aggregates (n = 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow histologic and immunohistologic patterns permitted the identification of four groups of clinical relevance: Group 1, cases with predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0012132'>erythroid hyperplasia</z:hpo> and without ALIP (n = 15); group 2, cases with prominent <z:mp ids='MP_0010373'>myeloid hyperplasia</z:mp> and presence of ALIP (n = 32); group 3, cases with hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 10); and group 4, cases with hyperfibrotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in survival and leukemic transformation between groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, with cases in group 2 showing the worst prognosis with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to increased propensity to leukemic transformation and cytopenia-related complications (P less than .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that immunohistochemistry is feasible on routinely processed BMB and the information obtained is of diagnostic and prognostic importance in P-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of ALIP varies with the morphologic and histologic subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the term should be reserved for cases in whom the clusters in the intertrabecular region are of myeloid (granulocytic and monocytic) lineage on immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
