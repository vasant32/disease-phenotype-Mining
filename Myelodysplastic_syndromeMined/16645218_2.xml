<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After initial analysis of donor and recipient samples at multiple loci before transplantation, one or more loci are used to follow engraftment status in subsequent specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe an unusual pattern of STRs in a transplanted patient with a prior history of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA chimerism studies showed a lack of engraftment at 1 and 2 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atypical minor peaks occurred at each of three STR loci in the pre-transplant and 2-month post-transplant recipient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these peaks were of equal amplitude as the major corresponding allele in the 1-month post-transplant sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> with specific chromosomal deletions before the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> diagnosis appears to explain the spurious peaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>STR analysis of blood and archival paraffin-embedded tissues collected from the patient at various time points before transplantation reflected the evolution, progression, and response to therapy of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The case illustrates the need for comprehensive evaluation of pertinent clinical and laboratory data during engraftment monitoring to identify potential sources for error in interpretation of STR analysis </plain></SENT>
