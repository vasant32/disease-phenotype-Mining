<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation of the p15(INK4B) gene was detected in 15 of 47 patients (32%), whereas only four patients demonstrated methylation of the p16(INK4A) gene (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of p15(INK4B) methylation was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t subtypes (p&lt;0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation of the p16(INK4A) gene was also more frequent in the subtypes that characterize advanced stages of the disease (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evolution of disease was verified in 17 (36%) of the 47 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A) methylation status with evolution of disease was clearly significant (p&lt;0.008 and p&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that methylation of the p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A) genes is an epigenetic biomarker of pediatric disease evolution </plain></SENT>
