<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that HLA DR15 plays a role in T-cell interactions with hematopoiesis and investigated the role of HLA DR15 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effects in HLA-matched allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective analysis of 119 consecutive related and 48 consecutive unrelated allogeneic BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> treated between 1991 and 2005 to investigate the influence of HLA DR15 on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and incidence of grades II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA DR15 was determined by either molecular (n = 108) or serologic (n = 59) methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of HLA DR15 was similar to the general white population (35/167 = 21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in transplantation characteristics between the HLA DR15-positive and -negative groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, OS, or PFS between the HLA DR15-positive versus-negative groups in any disease or donor relation subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HLA DR15-positive group experienced a significantly lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD grades II to IV: 23% versus 42% (P = .041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HLA DR15 reduces the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
