<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocytopathy</z:e> concomitantly to the development of a malignant haemopathy has been reported for some time, but little is known about the mechanism(s) involved in the platelet dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> VI (GPVI) has now been identified as a principal platelet receptor for collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report the cases of two patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and a B lymphopathy, respectively, who presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocytopathy</z:e> in relation to a defective GPVI-mediated platelet reactivity to collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, with regard to the different steps of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, activation secretion or aggregation, patients' platelet responses to collagen and to the GPVI specific <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, collagen related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CRP) or convulxin were null or dramatically impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet responses to other <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, TRAP, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">Arachidonic acid</z:chebi> were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or showed only a moderate decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GPVI content was repeatedly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and binding of specific ligands, such as convulxin, satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, specific activating monoclonal antibodies and convulxin failed to induce platelet secretion; collagen, CRP or convulxin were unable to provoke calcium mobilisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using a perfusion chamber model, we showed that ex vivo collagen-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> formation was very impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data provide evidence, for the first time, of an acquired defect in GPVI-mediated platelet reactivity to collagen, which reflects data observed in constitutional GPVI deficiencies, in two patients with malignant haemopathies </plain></SENT>
