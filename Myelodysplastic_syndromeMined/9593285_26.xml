<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 53 patients had a translocation involving chromosome 11, breakpoint q23, and chromosome 19, breakpoint p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyogram review enabled each patient to be further defined as t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) (21 patients) or t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) (32 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a marked difference between the type of banding and the translocation identified: t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) was detected predominantly by R-banding, whereas t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) was detected almost solely by G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional change was extremely rare in patients with t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) but occurred in nearly half of the patients with t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> of a myeloid lineage, mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), and were predominantly adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast patients with t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of both myeloid and lymphoid lineage and were mainly infants less than 1 year old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The survival of both groups of patients was generally poor, over 50% of t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) patients died within 2 years of diagnosis and the median survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) patients with t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) was 17.6 months </plain></SENT>
