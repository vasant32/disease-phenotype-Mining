<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Autonomous, factor-independent growth and differentiation of malignant cells in preleukemic and leukemic <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> is a well-recognized phenomenon and is often associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mast cells are distinct hematopoietic cells and express a unique profile of antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growth and differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mast cells is dependent on mast cell growth factor (MGF), the ligand of the c-kit protooncogene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we screened for mast cell-lineage involvement in 52 patients suffering from myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, or other diseases by probing for mast cell-related molecules (c-kit, tryptase, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>, and MGF) and by analyzing kit ligand/MGF-independent growth of mast cells in long-term suspension culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 52 patients tested, 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blast cells in transformation and 1 patient suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-BC) were diagnosed as mastocytic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were characterized by complex chromosomal abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, high percentages of circulating metachromatic cells (5% to 25%), high levels of cellular tryptase (&gt; 10 ng/10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells/mL) and a tryptase/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> (ng:ng) ratio greater than 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The metachromatic cells expressed the mast-cell-related surface antigen c-kit, but not basophil-related antigens (CD11b, CDw17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in these 3 patients, spontaneous, MGF-independent growth of mast cells along with spontaneous synthesis of tryptase was demonstrable in long-term culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No autocrine production, paracrine production, or overproduction of MGF was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous growth of mast cells could neither be abbrogated by addition of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to c-kit nor by MoAbs against MGF (&lt; 5% inhibition), whereas factor (MGF)-dependent differentiation of mast cells in these patients could be abbrogated by MoAbs to c-kit or MoAbs to MGF (&gt; 70% inhibition, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum MGF levels in these patients were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range and MGF could not be detected in cell-free culture supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of disease and had a survival time of less than 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we describe a unique form of transformation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-BC characterized by mast cell lineage involvement and factor-independent differentiation of mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This form of leukemic transformation has to be delineated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with basophilia or basophil crisis, from primary mast cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and from monocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> associated with basophilia </plain></SENT>
