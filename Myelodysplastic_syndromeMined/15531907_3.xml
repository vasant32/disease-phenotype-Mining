<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median time to leukocyte and platelet engraftment was faster in the twin group: 14 vs 17 (P=0.02) and 16 vs 26 days (P=0.09), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5 years cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the sibling than in the twin group (38 vs 27%; P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5 year cumulative incidence of relapse was 32% (95% CI: 29-35%) for the siblings and 39% (95% CI: 26-60%; P=0.6) for the twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A trend for better 5-years disease-free and overall survival was observed in the twin group: 34% (95% CI: 14-54%) vs 28% (95% CI: 25-31%; P=0.2) and 36% (95% CI: 15-57%) vs 32% (95% CI: 29-35%; P=0.09), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, stem cell transplantation from identical twins had a lower TRM: HR: 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2-0.9; P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate was similar for both groups with a HR of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.07-2.1; P=0.5), with a better survival for the twins: HR 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4-1.0; P=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that twin transplantation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/sAML is associated with a similar relapse risk, a lower TRM and a trend for better overall survival in comparison to transplantation from HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
