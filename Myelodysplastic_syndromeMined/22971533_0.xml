<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given these data, we sought to study the role of p73 methylation in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the methylation status of the p73 gene promoter was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) in bone marrow (BM) samples from 135 adult patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of MS-PCR were confirmed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that p73 methylation was present in 37% (n = 50) of these cases and methylaiton was correlated significantly with World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with advanced stages of WHO subtypes (30 vs. 59%, P = 0.002) exhibited a significantly higher frequency of p73 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a decrease in transcription of p73 was accompanied by methylation (P = 0.032) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi> treatment restored the expression of p73 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival of patients with p73 methylation was shorter than that for patients without p73 methylation (15 vs. &gt;33 months, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis also indicated that the p73 methylation status was the independent factor that impacted overall survival (OS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, we failed to find any significant association between p73 methylation and clinical responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">decitabine</z:chebi>, a hypomethylating agent that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, p73 methylation is common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and indicate poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>p73 may be a therapeutic target in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
