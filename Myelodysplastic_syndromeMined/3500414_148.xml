<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and refractory cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to improve hematopoiesis, we administered recombinant human granulocyte--macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, as part of a Phase I trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The GM-CSF was given by continuous intravenous infusion daily for two weeks and then again after a two-week rest period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the entire dose range tested (30 to 500 micrograms per square meter of body-surface area), treatment was associated with marked increases in peripheral-blood leukocytes (5- to 70-fold), including granulocytes (5- to 373-fold), in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absolute number of monocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocytes increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of eight patients also had 2- to 10-fold increases in platelet counts and improvement in erythropoiesis, with the result that two of three patients who had required red-cell and platelet transfusions no longer needed them (at 20 to 27 weeks of follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment was also associated with increased marrow cellularity and a decreased percentage of blasts in the bone marrow of patients with excess blasts, resulting in an increase in the ratio of differentiated myeloid cells to immature myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed relatively few side effects, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo> was dose-limiting when it was associated with high white-cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that GM-CSF is a potent stimulator of hematopoiesis in vivo and may produce hematologic improvement in the short term (8 to 32 weeks of observation) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More experience, with longer follow-up periods, will be necessary to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of this new treatment </plain></SENT>
