<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were made in our laboratory using WHO criteria based on morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, FISH and molecular data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 611 subjects (322 males/289 females) were prospectively diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> using WHO (2001) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Update and re-evaluation of cases using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (2008) criteria resulted in 649 MDS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using WHO (2008) criteria, refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) accounted for 68% of total cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 16.3%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), 6.5%; refractory cytopenia with unilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (RCUD), 4%; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-unclassifiable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS-U</z:e>), 4.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were administered questionnaires and information on previous disease, work histories and exposures to potential etiologic agents such as <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> (BZ) was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 80/649 (13.2%) were determined to have some BZ exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 30%, the most common being +8&gt;del(20)q&gt;del(7q)&gt;del(5q), while the analogous frequency in BZ-exposed cases was only 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> associated with BZ, we identified a subset of cases with high BZ exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These BZ signal cases were each matched by age and gender to two cases with no known BZ exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When contrasting BZ signal cases vs matched cases with no BZ exposure, we found a high odds ratio (OR) for the WHO subtype <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">MDS-U</z:e> (OR=11.1), followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and RCUD (OR=1), RA (OR=0.7) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e> (OR=0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with abnormal eosinophils (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-Eo) was strongly associated with BZ exposure, whereas the relative risk of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities was reduced for high BZ-exposed cases (OR=0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings are strongly indicative that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes are influenced by BZ exposure, and taken together with previous studies, the features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-Eo suggest that altered immune regulation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure to BZ </plain></SENT>
