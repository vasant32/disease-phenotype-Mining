<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The question as to whether the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> among the clean-up workers increased in 18 years after the catastrophe is still a point of much controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Precise diagnosis of the main forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> and comparison of these data with those in the general population will be helpful in estimating thr relative contribution of the radiation factor to the overall incidence of such pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 187 consecutive cases of malignant diseases of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues in Chernobyl clean-up workers were analyzed in Ukrainian Reference Laboratory in 1996-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 1942 consecutive patients of general population, mainly the residents of Kyiv city and district, diagnosed in References Laboratory at the same period comprised the group of comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytochemistry of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical techniques (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>, APAAP, ABC) and the panel of monoclonal antibodies to differentiation antigens of leukocytes were employed for immunophenotyping leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Various types of malignant disease of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues were registered in Chernobyl clean-up workers under study including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (nine patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (eight) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (31), chromic myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (17) and other forms of chromic myeloproliferative and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> including B-cell chromic lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (49 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The verified diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> according to modern classification (EGIL, WHO) could be the prerequisite for further analytical epidemiology study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> that may be related to the Chernobyl accident </plain></SENT>
