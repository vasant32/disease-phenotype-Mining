<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study of surface markers and in vitro growth in semi-solid and liquid medium was performed in 35 patients with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surface markers were studied by CD34, CD13, CD14, CD15, and CD33 monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no strict correlation with the FAB typing, but CD34 was expressed only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD14 was markedly positive in the 4 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colony-forming cells were assessed by culture in semi-solid medium in the presence of HTB9 as growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four growth patterns were identified: a) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth (6 cases); b) no growth or low plating efficiency (10 cases); c) low colony and high cluster number (15 cases); and d) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or high colony number with high number of clusters (4 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD34 was associated with low colony and high cluster number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally we studied the proliferation and differentiation capacities in liquid culture without stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had a spontaneous proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was not correlated with any surface marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differentiation assessed by the loss of CD34 and/or the increase of CD15 by more than 20% at day 7 was observed in 21 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the surface markers or growth patterns was associated with a specific chromosomal abnormality, except the lack of growth in liquid culture observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5q deletion cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t FAB subtypes, percentage of blasts higher than 5%, staining by CD33 and CD34, and lack of differentiation in liquid culture were significantly associated with progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, only CD34 expression (P = .002) and percentage of blasts (P = .05) remained independent significant variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CD34 was the only significant variable for prediction of survival (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that surface marker analysis at diagnosis and after liquid culture may be a useful tool for the initial evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
