<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to Ki-67 positive labelling, the proliferative fractions of bone marrow cells can be divided into low (&lt; 25%), intermediate (25%-35%), and high (&gt; 35%) grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The labelling positivity of Ki-67, BrdU and OKT9 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> higher than that of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the positive percentages of these three McAbs were significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the results of our experiment, an increase in proliferative fraction was related to clinical classification, prognosis, and therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the positive percentage of Ki-67 &gt; 40% and BrdU &gt; 30% or ratio of BrdU to Ki-67 &gt; 80% may be considered as parameters for unfavourable prognosis </plain></SENT>
