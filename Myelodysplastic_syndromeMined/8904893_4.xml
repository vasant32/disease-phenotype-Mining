<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>3 times per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients stopped the treatment after 2 months because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> (one patient) and cerebral haemorrhage (two patients); six had a partial response (PR) and continued Ly-IFN alpha; six were resistant and stopped Ly-IFN alpha; two evolved to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the six partial responders, four achieved a complete response (CR) during subsequent Ly-IFN alpha treatment (CR duration 3, 4+, 15+ and 29 months) and two did not achieve any further improvement (PR duration 3 and 9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two resistant patients had an unexpected clinical improvement soon after Ly-IFN alpha discontinuation and achieved a PR of 6+ and 14+ months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No toxicity related to Ly-IFN alpha treatment was observed and no reduction of dosage was needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion: (1) Ly-IFN alpha seems to be effective in some patients with HR-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>; (2) the best treatment duration seems to be of a least 6 months </plain></SENT>
