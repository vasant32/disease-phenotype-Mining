<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although a minor population of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>)-type blood cells is often detected in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), the significance of such cells in the pathophysiology of bone marrow (BM) failure remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined clonality in peripheral blood granulocytes from 118 female patients with AA or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> using the X chromosome inactivation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clonality, defined as a clonal population accounting for 35% or more of total granulocytes, was confirmed in 22 of 68 (32.4%) AA patients, in 13 of 44 (29.5%) RA patients, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 RA with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) patients, and in 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the frequency of patients with granulocyte clonality was compared with respect to the presence of increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells, the frequency was significantly lower in AA patients with (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>+; 21.2%) than without (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-; 42.9%) increased numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells (P =.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonality was absent in granulocytes from the 15 PNH+ RA patients but present in 13 of 29 (44.8%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>- RA patients (P =.0013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absence of clonality in AA and RA patients before treatment was strongly associated with positive response to immunosuppressive therapy (without clonality, 74.4%; with clonality, 33.3%; P =.0031) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>+ patients (without clonality, 96.2%; with clonality, 66.6%, P =.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that AA and RA with a minor population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells are benign types of BM failure with immune pathophysiology that have little relationship to clonal disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
