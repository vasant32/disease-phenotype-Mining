<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Rh antigens are not present on the platelet surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, platelet concentrates may contain enough RBCs to elicit an anti-D response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, D status must be considered in platelet transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In immunosuppressed patients, frequencies of D <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> of up to 19 percent have been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Here a prospective study is reported in which 22 D- patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> received D+ platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet concentrates were prepared from whole-blood donations according to the buffy coat method and were pooled before administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antibody screen test to detect anti-D was performed by LISS- IAT using the gel test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our series comprises 22 immunosuppressed D+ patients with a median age of 56 years (range, 23-79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients received 121 D-incompatible pooled platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- SD of RBC content was 4.17 +/- 1.74 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the 22 patients developed detectable anti-D after a median follow-up of 8 weeks (range, 1-37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of D <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> is low in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> after D-incompatible platelet transfusions using platelet concentrates prepared by the buffy coat method </plain></SENT>
