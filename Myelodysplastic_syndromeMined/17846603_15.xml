<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While a large proportion of HCT recipients become long-term disease-free survivors, recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> remains the leading cause of mortality after HCT </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report results among 16 patients treated with DLI for relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after HCT at a single institution between March 1993 and February 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cohort contained 10 men and 6 women with a median age of 49 (range, 22-67) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CR with resolution of cytopenias and prior disease markers occurred in 3 of 14 patients who could be evaluated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm prior reports that DLI can result in CR in some patients with recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> after transplant, but long-term survival is infrequent </plain></SENT>
