<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transfusion-related morbidity is an emerging problem in chronically transfused patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several iron-chelating drugs are available, the optimal way of treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron-overload</z:e> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A major disadvantage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> is that the drug has to be applied as continuous subcutaneous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, novel oral agents have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of these drugs is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">Exjade</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report on 14 MDS patients who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> (500-1500 mg daily) for up to 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these patients, treatment responses were recorded by determining serum ferritin levels before and during therapy and by applying recently established response criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except one, ferritin levels decreased during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients showed a complete response, one a minor response and five a stable iron load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the responding patients, initially <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>elevated liver enzymes</z:hpo> decreased substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No substantial change in transferrin saturation or transfusion frequency was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Side effects were mild and tolerable in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In one patient, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> was stopped because of impaired kidney function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> is a reasonable approach to counteract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
