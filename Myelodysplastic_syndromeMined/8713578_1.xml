<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had a 2-year history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> followed by marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> up to 57.5 x 10(9)/l with 88% segmented neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and biopsy showed hypercellular marrow with <z:mp ids='MP_0010373'>myeloid hyperplasia</z:mp> and 16% myeloblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were also significant morphological abnormalities which included neutrophils with few granules, hypersegmented nucleus or Pelger-Heut anomaly, and micromegakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis disclosed a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed as having CNL with dysplastic features and was treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, leukemic transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> occurred within a year and he died 16 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000219'>Neutrophilia</z:mp> is a feature not of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) but rather of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> such as CNL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this patient was considered to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with increased proliferation and differentiation of neutrophilic lineage, because of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
