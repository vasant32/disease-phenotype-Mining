<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a single case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> with HSR for cyclin D1 and postulated that HSR for cyclin D1 is an independent poor prognostic indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report 7 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> with HSR for cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases occurred in elderly men and women with an average age of 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three cases occurred in areas of intermittent sun exposure, 2 cases occurred in chronically sun-damaged areas, and 2 cases were acral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HSR correlated with aggressive histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average Breslow depth was 2.7 mm (range, 1-11 mm), the average mitotic index was 5.1 per square millimeter, and 5 of the 7 cases were ulcerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was available for 6 of the 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of the 6 cases for which clinical follow-up was available metastasized, and 1 patient died of metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> occurred in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanomas</z:hpo> with lower Breslow depths, ranging from 1.0 to 1.4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These additional cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> with an aggressive clinical course provide further evidence of the prognostic significance of HSR for cyclin D1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Larger cohort studies are needed to validate this observation </plain></SENT>
