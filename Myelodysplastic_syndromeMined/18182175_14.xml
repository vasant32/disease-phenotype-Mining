<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C/EBPalpha is encoded by an intronless gene that is 2783 bp long and maps to human chromosome 19q13.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C/EBPalpha is a member of the basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) class of DNA-binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The loss of function of C/EBPalpha has leukemogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four types of polymorphisms and 25 mutations (3 already known mutations and 22 novel mutations) were detected in CEBPA (gene for the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) alpha) in analysed samples from 390 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CEBPA mutations were found in 14/152 (9.2%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients' samples, 6/143 (4.2%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients' samples, 2/56 (3.6%) of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) patients' samples and 2/39 (5.1%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) patients' samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No C/EBPalpha mutations were detected in healthy donors (41 individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We discuss how these mutations can affect the cellular function of C/EBPalpha and block the myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
