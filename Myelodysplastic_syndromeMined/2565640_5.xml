<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromosome studies were also carried out virtually simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We chose to study only patients showing a deficit of chemotaxis (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of these patients revealed a clonal chromosome abnormality in most of the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody technique using MoAb 60.1, 60.3, 60.5, OKM1, LFA-1 and 9E8 demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leukocyte membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> CD 11a, b, c and CD 18 and therefore excludes that an abnormality of these is involved in the pathogenesis of altered leukocyte chemotaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation between chemotactic deficit and any specific clonal chromosome abnormality was found </plain></SENT>
