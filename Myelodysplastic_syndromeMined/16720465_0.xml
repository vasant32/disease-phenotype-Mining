<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: The utility of predictive systems in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancy</z:e> stems both from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of disease presentation and from the inherent disadvantages of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> morbidity and mortality associated with chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, a need for long term follow-up, the possibility of treatment failure and the issue of cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, the value of a scoring system is in its ability to quantify disease burden, classify patient subgroups and predict disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful scoring systems are disease-specific, have been validated in an independent population and are useful in different countries, centres and individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There should be good discrimination of poorly responsive and optimally responsive populations and a high rate of prediction of the disease course for individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Optimal utility should be provided by a few variables which are independent, highly predictive and easy to obtain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other considerations include economic evaluation and adaptation for population changes over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Experience gained from the use of staging and scoring systems in haematology provides useful insights into their potential use in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry disease</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085078" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lysosomal storage diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such systems may help to predict whom to treat, when to treat and what response is likely to be achieved </plain></SENT>
