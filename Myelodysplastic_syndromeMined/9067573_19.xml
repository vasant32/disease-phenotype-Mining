<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>EVI1, located at chromosome band 3q26, encodes a 1051 amino acid zinc finger protein inappropriately expressed in the leukemic cells of 2-5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activation of EVI1 often follows a chromosomal rearrangement involving band 3q26, and the two most frequent rearrangements are the t(3;3)(q21;q26) and the inv(3)(q21q26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EVI1 exists also as a longer protein that includes 188 additional amino acids at the N-terminus, named MDS1/EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both genes are expressed at very low levels in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genomic region between the first coding exon of MDS1/EVI1 and the first coding exon of EVI1 is 150-300 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the chromosomal breakpoints at the 5' end of EVI1 in the t(3;3) resulting in EVI1 activation have been mapped in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of the t(3;3), the cell would be unable to express MDS1/EVI1, although it would express EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have compared the transcriptional activity of MDS1/EVI1 and EVI1, and we show that MDS1/EVI1 is a strong activator of promoters containing the AGATA motif, whereas EVI1 is a repressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, whereas EVI1 represses activation by the GATA-1 erythroid factor, MDS1/EVI1 does not, and is itself repressed by EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By gene fusion to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4, we further show that the activation properties of MDS1/EVI1 are restricted to an acidic segment encoded by the second and third exons in the 5' untranslated region of EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We have also examined the relative expression of the two genes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and in the bone marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients with 3q26 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the rearrangements at 3q26 affect expression of EVI1, but not of MDS1/EVI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We propose that rearrangements at 3q26 involving EVI1 could result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> by a two-step process involving first transcriptional disruption of MDS1/EVI1, and next by inappropriately activating expression of EVI1 </plain></SENT>
