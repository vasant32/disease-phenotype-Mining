<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies demonstrated highly variable frequencies of DAPK1 promoter methylation by the use of methylation-specific PCR (MSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By quantitative high-resolution assessment, we demonstrate that aberrant DNA methylation is an extremely rare event in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed elevated levels just in one out of 246 (0.4%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 42 MDS patients were unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we present a refined DAPK1 methylation analysis in a large representative patient cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients proofing almost complete absence of elevated DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
