<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that standardized systemic drug delivery would improve treatment safety and provide better <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore developed an intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> formulation and combined it with fludarabine instead of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in preparation for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a Bayesian method to compare the outcomes of 67 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients who received intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (BuCy2) with 148 subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>-fludarabine (Bu-Flu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups had comparable pretreatment characteristics, except that the Bu-Flu patients were older, more often had unrelated donors and had a shorter follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A greatly improved outcome in the Bu-Flu group is unlikely to be explained by improved supportive care during this time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the data support replacing BuCy2 with or without antithymocyte globulin (ATG) with Bu-Flu with or without rabbit-ATG for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further suggest that the high level of safety and fast recovery from conditioning therapy-related side effects after the Bu-Flu regimen makes it a suitable platform technology for testing additional adjuncts for improved posttransplant immune recovery and long-term disease control in patients who are at high risk of rapidly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> after alloSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extremely low one-year treatment-related mortality as well as high overall and event-free survival of patients in the Bu-Flu group indicate that it is time to revisit the value of alloSCT compared with conventional maintenance chemotherapy for patients in first complete remission of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
