<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A specific anti-AcSDKP polyclonal antibody allows the level of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48030">tetrapeptide</z:chebi> by to be determined by enzyme immunoassay with good sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present results demonstrating the presence of AcSDKP in humans: serum levels of 34 healthy controls were found to be between 0.7 and 2.5 pm/ml, regardless of age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High levels were found in 44% of asymptomatic controls but only in 8% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients out of a total of 37 patients with HIV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, studies of serum levels were performed before treatment in 121 subjects with disorders of the nonlymphoid and the lymphoid lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results did not demonstrate any decrease in serum levels, however a moderate or marked increase was noted in one-third of the subjects, which was greater in disorders of the non-lymphoid lineages (48% of 72 patients) than the lymphoid lineage (21% of 50 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant differences were observed between controls versus patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>, 24 patients: p &lt; 0.001), controls versus patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 15 patients: p &lt; 0.02), as well as patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> versus patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (PMDS, 10 patients: p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
