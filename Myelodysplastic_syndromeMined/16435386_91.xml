<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elderly patients (age &gt; or = 65 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) generally have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-type therapy results are often derived from studies in younger patients and may not apply to elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many investigators and oncologists advocate, at times, only supportive care or frontline single agents, Phase I-II studies, low-intensity regimens, or 'targeted' therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, baseline expectations for outcomes of elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with 'standard' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-type therapy are not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim was to develop prognostic models for complete response (CR), induction (8-week) mortality, and survival rates in elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, which would be used to advise oncologists and patients of expectations with standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> type therapy, and to establish baseline therapy results against which novel strategies would be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 998 patients age &gt; or = 65 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (&gt; 10% blasts) treated with intensive chemotherapy between 1980 and 2004 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors associated with CR, induction (8-week) mortality, and survival used standard methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall CR rate was 45% and induction mortality 29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors identified consistent independent poor prognostic factors for CR, 8-week mortality, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These included age &gt; or = 75 years, unfavorable karyotypes (often complex), poor performance (3-4 ECOG [Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group]), longer duration of antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorder</z:e>, treatment outside the laminar airflow room, and abnormal organ functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients could be divided into: 1) a favorable group (about 20% of patients) with expected CR rates above 60%, induction mortality rates of 10%, and 1-year survival rates above 50%; 2) an intermediate group (about 50-55% of patients) with expected CR rates of 50%, induction mortality rates of 30%, and 1-year survival rates of 30%; and 3) an unfavorable risk group (about 25-30% of patients) with expected CR rates of less than 20%, induction mortality rates above 50%, and 1-year survival rates of less than 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic models, based on standard readily available baseline characteristics, were developed for elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, which may assist in therapeutic and investigational decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These predictive models, based on a retrospective analysis, will require validation in independent study groups </plain></SENT>
