<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed flow cytometric features of bone marrow from 70 cases of PMF and compared them with those from 17 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MF and 20 nonneoplastic control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with JAK2(V617F) and cytogenetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granulocytes and monocytes from PMF cases exhibited multiple dysplastic features overlapping with those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MF at a comparable or higher frequency: low side scattering, aberrant CD56 expression in granulocytes and monocytes, and an abnormal CD13/CD16 maturation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unique to PMF was the small granulocyte size compared with that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MF and control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the percentage of CD56+ granulocytes and monocytes did not correlate with JAK2(V617F) or cytogenetic abnormalities, a subset analysis of 36 cases revealed that median fluorescence intensity of CD56 expression correlated positively with the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that although there is considerable overlap between PMF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MF, the smaller granulocytes observed in PMF are a useful distinguishing feature </plain></SENT>
