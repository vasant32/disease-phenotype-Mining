<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interferon (IFN) has shown antiproliferative activity in several malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> and potentially may be of benefit when administered early after BMT when the number of residual cells is minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested in a phase I study the maximum tolerated daily dose of recombinant IFN alpha-2b in patients who had received a transplant for a disease at high risk for relapse (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> or non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> beyond first remission, advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> at any stage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in accelerated or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast phase</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombinant IFN alpha-2b was started at a dose of 0.5 x 10(6) IU/m2 and escalated by 0.5 x 10(6) IU/m2 in groups of three or four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intention was to administer IFN as soon as stable engraftment after BMT was achieved (defined as an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 2.0 x 10(9)/L and platelet count greater than 100 x 10(9)/L for 5 consecutive days) and continued for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 14 patients were enrolled after autologous (n = 3) or allogeneic (n = 11) BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicity was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant (grade 2 to 4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> led to discontinuation or dose reduction in five of eight patients receiving 1.5 x 10(6) or 2 x 10(6) IU/m2 IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild to moderate (grade 1 or 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> occurred in the majority of patients independent of the IFN dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>De novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD responsive to steroid treatment developed in 3 of 11 allograft recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Natural killer (NK) cell function was low before IFN treatment and was not improved with the cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, interleukin-2-activated NK cells showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function even before starting IFN and no change was seen during IFN treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clonogenic hematopoietic progenitor studies showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> progenitor lines (colony-forming unit [CFU]-granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte, CFU granulocyte-macrophage, burst-forming unit-erythroid) by IFN at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose levels except at 0.5 x 10(6) IU/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Considering this result and the incidence and severity of marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> seen at doses greater than 1.0 x 10(6) IU/m2, we would consider this the maximum dose safely tolerated if IFN alpha-2b is administered in this setting for a prolonged course on a daily basis </plain></SENT>
