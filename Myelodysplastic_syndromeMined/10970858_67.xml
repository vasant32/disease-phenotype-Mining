<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As a result of the recurring translocation t(11;16) (q23;p13.3), MLL (mixed-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) is fused in frame to CBP (CREB binding protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation has been documented almost exclusively in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> secondary to therapy with drugs that target DNA topo isomerase II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The minimal chimeric protein that is produced fuses MLL to the bromodomain, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, EIA-binding domain and steroid-receptor coactivator binding domains of CBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that transplantation of bone marrow retrovirally transduced with MLL-CBP induces myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> in mice that are preceded by a long preleukemic phase similar to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) seen in many t(11;16) patients but unusual for other MLL translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structure-function analysis demonstrated that fusion of both the bromodomain and HAT domain of CBP to the amino portion of MLL is required for full in vitro transformation and is sufficient to induce the leukemic phenotype in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the leukemic effect of MLL-CBP results from the fusion of the chromatin association and modifying activities of CBP with the DNA binding activities of MLL </plain></SENT>
