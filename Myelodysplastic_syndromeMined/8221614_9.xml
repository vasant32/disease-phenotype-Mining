<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some data also indicate that cytogenetic patterns vary with age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further investigate whether the frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chromosome aberrations differ between children and adults or between men and women, clinical and karyologic data on 14,141 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with clonal chromosome changes reported in the literature were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cytogenetically well-characterized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, recognized primary and secondary chromosome aberrations were selected, and their frequencies were calculated in men, women, children (&lt; or = 15 years), and adults (&gt; 15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, the frequencies of the various aberrations did not differ between men and women or between children and adults, but a few exceptions were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and RA with excess of blasts or in transformation, del(5q) was more common among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL-L1 + L2), t(1;19) was more frequently detected in women and del(6q) more common among men </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four primary aberrations were more common in children than in adults: t(8;21) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M2), -7 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M4, der(11q) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M5, and t(8;14) in ALL-L3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, der(16q) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M4 and t(9;22) in ALL-L1 + L2 were more common in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary cancer</z:e> chromosome aberration showing a variation with age was loss of the Y chromosome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M2 with t(8;21), being more common in children than in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These variations might be spurious and level out when more data are collected, but more probably they reflect, for reasons presently unknown, that different genetic mechanisms may be operative in children and adults--and even in men and women--in the development of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
