<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This corresponds to a 5-year actuarial prevalence of 3% and an 8-year prevalence of 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomised to treatment with either melphalan or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and the relative capabilities of these two drugs to cause these conditions were examined as a function of duration of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship with length of melphalan treatment was found but no relationship was observed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount of melphalan treatment given in various intervals before diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was studied and it was found that the amount of treatment in the most recent 3-year period was the most important determinant of risk (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that the risk of haemopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> after 10 years of follow-up is about 3% for each year of melphalan treatment and that much of this risk will occur within three years of the last treatment </plain></SENT>
