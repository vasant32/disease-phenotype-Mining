<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite limited published supportive data, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is used preemptively (pDLI) to improve donor chimerism and prevent relapse, and therapeutically (tDLI) after disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of pDLI and tDLI in 113 patients after TCD (alemtuzumab, n = 99; antithymocyte globulin, n = 14) RIC HSCT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recipients of pDLI (n = 62) had an estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) of 80% and an event-free survival of 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More than one-half (52%; n = 32) of the patients received pDLI within 6 months post-HSCT; despite this, the 5-year incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was only 31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19%-43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recipients of tDLI (n = 51) had an estimated 5-year OS of 40% and a 5-year relapse/progression rate of 69% (95% CI, 54%-81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recipients of tDLI at &gt;6 months post-HSCT had a significantly superior 5-year OS after tDLI compared with those treated earlier (P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> at 5 years after tDLI was 45% (95% CI, 23%-65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that pDLI safely promotes durable remission after TCD RIC HSCT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and that tDLI salvages patients after late relapse with greater efficacy </plain></SENT>
