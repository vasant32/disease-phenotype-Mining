<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, we showed that increased miR-181a expression was associated with improved outcomes in cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (CN-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, miR-181a expression was increased in CN-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients harboring CEBPA mutations, which are usually biallelic and associate with better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CEBPA encodes the C/EBPα transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that the presence of N-terminal CEBPA mutations and miR-181a expression are linked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the truncated C/EBPα-p30 isoform, which is produced from the N-terminal mutant CEBPA gene or from the differential translation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CEBPA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and is commonly believed to have no transactivation activity, binds to the miR-181a-1 promoter and up-regulates the microRNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that lenalidomide, a drug approved for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, enhances translation of the C/EBPα-p30 isoform, resulting in higher miR-181a levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In xenograft mouse models, ectopic miR-181a expression inhibits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, lenalidomide exhibits antitumorigenic activity paralleled by increased miR-181a expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This regulatory pathway may explain an increased sensitivity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing chemotherapy in subsets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our data provide a potential explanation for the improved clinical outcomes observed in CEBPA-mutated CN-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, and suggest that lenalidomide treatment enhancing the C/EBPα-p30 protein levels and in turn miR-181a may sensitize <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blasts to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
