<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of sixty cytogenetically aberrant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with a complex karyotype including del(5q) and del(20q), showed a hemizygous interstitial deletion of the ETV6 and CDKN1B loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No concomitant rearrangement of the other ETV6 allele was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of nineteen cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> displayed a hemizygous interstitial deletion involving CDKN1B, but not ETV6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, cryptic deletions of these genes seem to be rare in cytogenetically abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> without 12p aberrations (2%), whereas they may be more frequent in karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the present findings show that the deletions may be narrow, not including the ETV6 gene, and indirectly suggest that CDKN1B, or a closely located genomic segment, is the target of 12p deletions </plain></SENT>
