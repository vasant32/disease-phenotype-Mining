<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this phase II study (no </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NCT00443339), lower-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) level &lt;500 IU/L received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DAR</z:e> 500 μg once every 2 weeks for 12 weeks, with G-CSF added at week 12 in non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical performance was assessed with the 6-min walking test and, for fit patients, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QoL was evaluated using SF-36 and FACT-An tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 99 patients, erythroid response rate according to IWG 2006 criteria was 48 and 56 % at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of G-CSF rescued 22 % of non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 48 % of the responders, interval between darbepoetin injections could be increased for maintenance treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum EPO level was the only independent predictive factor of response at 12 weeks, and its most discriminant cutoff value was 100 IU/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>QoL and VO2max showed improvement over time in responders, compared with non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 52 months, median response duration was not reached, and 3-year cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and overall survival (OS) was 14.5 and 70 %, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Tolerance of darbepoetin was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this regimen of darbepoetin every 2 weeks yielded high response rates and prolonged response duration </plain></SENT>
