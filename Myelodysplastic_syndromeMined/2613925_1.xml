<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A modified, small volume, two phase, disc culture system for CFU-GM (seven and 14 days of incubation) was compared with a standard single layer system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 1 ml single layer cultures were counted unstained in situ before both sets of cultures were transferred to glass slides for staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrows were cultured from forty eight subjects, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Observer error was least with the disc cultures, whereas variation between replicate cultures was similar for both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high degree of correlation was found between the two methods for both day 7 (r = 0.90) and day 14 (r = 0.91) cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of colonies and clusters was higher with the disc system, indicating better cloning efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of subsets of clinical groups showed similar patterns of abnormality with both systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The simplicity of the method makes the use of this technology possible in most laboratories, and the superior morphological resolution may increase the clinical usefulness of such studies </plain></SENT>
