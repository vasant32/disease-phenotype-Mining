<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis demonstrated that OS and PFI were significantly affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since single 7q- showed a better survival than the poor IPSS cytogenetic category (P=0.009), it was considered as a new prognostic entity ('modified IPSS categories') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis OS was significantly influenced by age, marrow blast cell percentage, number of cytopenias and either modified or standard IPSS cytogenetic categories; hazard ratios for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> progression were influenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the former, except for age and cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of del(7)(q31q35) confirmed the results of univariate analysis, but the Akaike Information Criterion showed no difference in evaluating OS and PFI between the modified and standard IPSS cytogenetic grouping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, (i) chromosome defects as grouped by IPSS and blast cell percentage are the most relevant parameters for predicting OS and PFI; (ii) the prognostic power of the IPSS cytogenetic grouping is not ameliorated by the introduction of del(7)(q31q35) as a new entity; (iii) complex karyotypes have a prognostic value independent of blast cell percentage </plain></SENT>
