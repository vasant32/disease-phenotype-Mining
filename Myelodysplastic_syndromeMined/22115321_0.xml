<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) require blood product support to manage the severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemias</z:hpo>, which frequently accompany <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to show the feasibility of linking the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database with records from Puget Sound Blood Center (PSBC) to characterize blood product use over time in successive cohorts of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in the SEER registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cohort was then linked to PSBC records to discern blood product use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 783 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> entered in the SEER database from 2001 to 2007 for whom data were also available in the PSBC database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who received transfusions, 97% received packed red blood cells; 52% received platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> receiving blood products declined from 2001 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data show a recent decline in blood product use for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to further evaluate the reasons for this finding, specifically exploring the impact of newer medications on blood product use in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
