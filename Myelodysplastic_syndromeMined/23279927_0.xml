<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the whole-arm translocation der(5;19)(p10;q10) has not been fully analyzed because of its rarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we used flow cytometry to evaluate the immunophenotype of two patients' bone marrow mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients had involved der(5;19)(p10;q10) in their karyotype analyzed by standard G-banding technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patients had the CD7+ and CD41+ phenotype, and the CD41 positivity suggested that the myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> involving der(5;19)(p10;q10) were of megakaryoblastic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The der(5;19)(p10;q10) abnormality is associated with unique characteristics of the immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We address the clinical, immunophenotypic and morphological aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> involving der(5;19)(p10;q10), along with a review of the literature </plain></SENT>
