<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The translocations resulted in loss of 5q material in both cases and gain of 1q in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A compilation of previously published <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> with translocations involving the long arms of chromosomes 1 and 5 revealed a total of 23 cases--11 with unbalanced and 12 with balanced t(1;5)--with the following <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp>: 11 AML, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, two Philadelphia-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo>, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients had received chemotherapy including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> for a previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and one had been exposed to thorotrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 14 patients for whom survival data exist, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except three have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The t(1;5) was found as the sole abnormality in six cases, whereas it was apparently secondary--occurring in a subclone or together with the well-known primary abnormalities t(8;21), t(9;22), and t(15;17)--in nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints in 1q varied from 1q11 to 1q43, with a clustering to 1q21-23, and the 5q breaks occurred in 5q11 to 5q35, mainly in the distal 5q3 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The unbalanced 1;5 translocations resulted in gain of 1q material in eight of the 11 cases, 1q21-1qter being duplicated in four of them, and in loss of 5q, most often the 5q3 region, in 10 of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that translocations between 1q and 5q, although cytogenetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> of the myeloid lineages and with previous mutagenic exposure, and that t(1;5) seems to confer a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
