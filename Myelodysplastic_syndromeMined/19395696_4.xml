<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors examined the relations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and lifestyle factors to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in a cohort of 471,799 persons aged 50-71 years who were recruited into the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study, a large US prospective study, in 1995-1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was diagnosed in 193 persons during 2001-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant positive association was observed between body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) at baseline and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with persons with a BMI less than 25.0, the hazard ratios for persons with BMIs of 25.0-&lt;30.0 and &gt;or=30.0 were 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 1.64) and 2.18 (95% CI: 1.51, 3.17; P for trend &lt; 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association was not affected by physical activity, cigarette smoking, or alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As reported in previous studies, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was elevated among former smokers (hazard ratio = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.17, 2.41) and current smokers (hazard ratio = 3.17, 95% CI: 2.02, 4.98) as compared with never smokers </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This prospective investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> implicates both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and smoking as modifiable risk factors </plain></SENT>
