<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Circumstantial evidence also suggests that some individuals may be genetically predisposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and a general method used to analyse such disease susceptibility is the study of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) at particular loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Harvey ras (Ha-ras) locus includes a hypervariable region (HVR) which consists of a series of 28-base-pair (bp) tandem repeats 3' to the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This arrangement gives rise to alleles of a wide range of sizes, making such genetic analysis possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A previous study reported that white blood cell DNA from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients frequently showed allelic restriction fragments at the Ha-ras locus which were found only rarely in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> unaffected individuals, and it was concluded that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of such unusual alleles may be linked to a susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As this conclusion has major implications we sought to investigate whether this association could be confirmed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancy</z:e> reported to have the highest frequency of rare alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Ha-ras alleles were characterized in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy individuals and compared with those found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results, reported here, show that the distribution of Ha-ras alleles in myelodysplastic patients is not significantly different from that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
