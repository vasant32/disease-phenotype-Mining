<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The myeloid transcription factor CEBPA is crucial for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we found that conditional expression of AME suppresses CEBPA protein by 90.8% and DNA-binding activity by 93.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CEBPA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we detected no differences in CEBPA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in leukemic blasts of patients carrying the AME translocation (n = 8) compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CEBPA protein and binding activity, however, were reduced significantly (100% and 92.1%, respectively) in AME patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed that calreticulin (CRT), a putative inhibitor of CEBPA translation, was strongly activated after induction of AME in the cell-line system (14.8-fold) and in AME patient samples (12.2-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, inhibition of CRT by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> powerfully restored CEBPA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results identify CEBPA as a key target of the leukemic fusion protein AME and suggest that modulation of CEBPA by CRT may represent a mechanism involved in the differentiation block in AME <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
