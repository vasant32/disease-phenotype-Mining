<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of c-FLIPL, c-FLIPS and DLK1 in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of 16 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 3 controls were detected by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the expression of DLK1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, as compared with controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in expression of DLK1 between RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients (p &gt; 0.05); the expression of c-FLIPL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> both in RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients was higher than that in controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in expression of c-FLIPL between RA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients (p &gt; 0.05); the expression of c-FLIPS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was not significantly different between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients and controls (p &gt; 0.05), but its expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> patients was significantly higher as compared with RA patients and controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of DLK1, c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients are abnormal, some of which may be useful as an important indicator for the evaluation of development in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
