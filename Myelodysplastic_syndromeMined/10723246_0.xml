<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were exposed to atomic bomb radiation at distances of 1.2 and 1.1 km, respectively, and were given a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> 44 and 46 years after the bombing, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The male patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>(RA) and a bone marrow cell karyotype of 46, XY, del(1)(p22p32), t(8;11)(p11;p15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The female patient had RA with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and a karyotype of 45, X, -X, t(1;11)(p32;q23), +del(1)(p32), inv(3) (p21q27), del(5)(q15), -6, -9, -19, +mar 1, +mar 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multi-separated nuclear megakaryocytes were observed in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that they had been exposed to radiation near the atomic explosion despite the fact that their symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> developed more than 40 years after the bombing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1p32 is known to be the locus of the TAL1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, Southern blot analysis did not reveal rearrangement of the TAL1 gene in the male patient </plain></SENT>
