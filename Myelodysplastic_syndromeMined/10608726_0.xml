<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 56-year-old woman who had undergone regular hemodialysis for 10 years for complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and then had had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung tuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e>, she suffered from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> and was treated by antituberculosis agents and high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> administration without any effect on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adding a series of plasma exchanges, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> improved gradually, and her <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> began to respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma hypercytokinemia due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> was corrected by plasma exchange, and the correction of a high level of plasma inflammatory cytokine was considered to be one of the contributing factors for the improvement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that therapeutic plasma exchange should be considered as a therapeutic tool for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> refractory to conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
