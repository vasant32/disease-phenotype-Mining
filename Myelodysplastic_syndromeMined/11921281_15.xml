<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> with dmin were seen at the Roswell Park <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute between 1985 and 2000; eight had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and one a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated MYC amplification on dmin in four patients, but MLL amplification was not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spectral karyotyping showed that the dmin derived from chromosome 11 in one patient and from chromosome 19 in two others without MYC or MLL amplification; derivation from these chromosomes was confirmed by FISH with chromosome paint probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dmin of chromosome 11 origin hybridized to a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome (BAC) RP11-112M22 that maps to 11q24.3 and is predicted to contain ETS1 and other markers, including D11S11351 and D11S4091 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dmin of chromosome 19 origin in one patient hybridized to BACs RP11-46I12 and RP11-110J19; in the other patient, these clones did not hybridize with the dmin, but were found to be amplified on a marker chromosome that was derived from chromosome 19 in that patient's cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These BACs have been mapped to 19q12-19q13.1 and 19q11-19q13.1, respectively, and are predicted to contain the markers D19S409 and D19S919 and the gene for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17976">ubiquinol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> C reductase, Rieske <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30408">iron-sulfur</z:chebi> polypeptide1 (UQCRFS1). dmin originating from chromosome 19 have not been reported previously in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
