<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that an ANLL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> suppressor gene resides on 5q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the gene is most likely localized between FGF1 and PDGFRB/CSF1R loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The region has also been linked to at least four other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e>, Treacher Collins syndrome, diastrophic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006785'>limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo>, by linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC) spanning 450 kb around the FGF1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six YAC clones were isolated from a human YAC library and their restriction enzyme maps were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overlap of the clones with each other and with FGF1 cosmid and phage clones was characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of the YAC clones were found to contain the entire FGF1 gene, which spans more than 100 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proximal and distal ends of several of these YAC clones were isolated for further overlap cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proximal ends of both Y2 and Y4 were localized to previously isolated FGF1 DNA by sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The distal ends of these two clones also hybridized to a human-hamster hybrid containing chromosome 5 as the only human genetic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that these YAC clones represent colinear DNA around the FGF1 locus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
