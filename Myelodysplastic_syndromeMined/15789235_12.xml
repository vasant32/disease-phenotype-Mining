<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have already shown that DC can be successfully generated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and myeloplastic syndromes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) cells in serum-free 'standard' medium (X-vivo + GM-CSF + IL-4 +TNFalpha + FL) in 10-14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present that DC counts generated from mononuclear cells (MNC) varied between 20% (from 55 MDS samples), 34% (from 100 AML samples) and 25% (from 38 healthy MNC samples) medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between 53% and 58% of DC are mature CD83+ DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DC harvests were highest in monocytoid FAB types (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M4/M5, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>) and independent from cytogenetic risk groups, demonstrating that DC-based strategies can be applied for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytogenetic risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proof of the clonal derivation of DC generated was obtained in five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases with a combined FISH/immunophenotype analysis (FISH-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="17824,30802">IPA</z:chebi>): The clonal numerical chromosome aberrations of the diseases were regularly codetectable with DC markers; however, not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clonal cells being convertible to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-derived DC(leu) (on average, 53% of blasts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To the contrary, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DC generated carried the clonal aberration (on average, 51% of DC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 41 AML and 13 MDS cases with a suitable antigen expression, we could confirm FISH-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="17824,30802">IPA</z:chebi> data by Flow cytometry: although DC(leu) are regularly detectable, on average only 57% of blasts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 64% of blasts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were converted to DC(leu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After coculture with DC in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR), autologous T cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients proliferate and upregulate costimulatory receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The specific lysis of leukemic cells by autologous T cells could be demonstrated in three cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in a Fluorolysis assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In six cases with only few DC(leu) or few vital T cells available after the DC/MLR procedure, no lysis of allogeneic or autologous leukemic cells was seen, pointing to the crucial role of both partners in the lysis process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude: (1) the generation of DC is regularly possible in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and also in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> under serum-free conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(2) Clonal/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-derived DC(leu) can be regularly generated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-MNC; however, not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blasts being converted to DC(leu) and not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DC generated carrying leukemic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We recommend to select DC(leu) for vaccinations or ex vivo T-cell activations to avoid contaminations with non-converted blasts and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-derived DC and to improve the harvest of specific, anti-leukemic T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DC and DC-primed T cells could provide a practical strategy for the immunotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
