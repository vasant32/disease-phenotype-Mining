<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FLIP (FLICE (FAS-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-domain-like IL-1beta-converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein)) was identified as an inhibitor of FAS and TRAIL signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we characterized FLIP(Long) (FLIP(L)) and FLIP(Short) (FLIP(S)) expression in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) and in CD34+ cells of 29 MDS patients, and in 17 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression was correlated with apoptotic indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In CD34+ cells, FLIP(L) levels were higher among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among total BMMNC, FLIP(L) levels also tended to be higher in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, although this difference was not significant (P=0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FLIP(L) levels in CD34+ cells were negatively correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrows (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FLIP(Short) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in both BMMNC (P=0.03) and CD34+ cells (P=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to FLIP(L), FLIP(St) levels were positively correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the protein level FLIP was most readily detectable in patients with high blast counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that FLIP(L) and FLIP(S) are differentially regulated, and that the relative levels of both isoforms play a role in the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
