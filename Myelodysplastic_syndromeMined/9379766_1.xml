<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fact, as some authors consider ACCLS a new type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, others maintain that it is in Ph'negative/bcr-abl negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new case of ACCLS appeared in a 68 year old woman, who presented with anaemic symptoms, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>recurrent infections</z:hpo>, and a haematological picture including progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and leuco-<z:mp ids='MP_0005096'>erythroblastosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marrow hypercellularity with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012138'>granulocytic hyperplasia</z:hpo>, and mature granulocytes presenting nuclear hyposegmentation and large peripheral blocks of chromatin separated by clear zones were the characteristic features of this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No cytogenetic abnormalities were found and DNA flow-cytometry content was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (euploid), supporting the thought that a disequilibrium exists in the hetero-chromatin/eucromatin ration in AACLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reverse PCR for bcr-abl transcripts was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cell-cycle-phase analysis showed a high fraction of S-cells in the bone marrow (27%) in contrast to a very low S-phase (0.2%) in the peripheral blood, pattern that is different from both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro clonogenic assays showed a high colony forming capacity and a certain grade of autonomous proliferation of the bone marrow cells, which is reminiscent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e> growth behaviour in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi>, low dose Ara-C, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> until her demise, fifteen months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In total, the patient received 47 units of packed cells and 114 of platelet concentrates, and was transfused only when she presented anaemic or hemorrhagic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These clinical and haematological features suggest that ACCLS is a distinct entity that should be considered a sixth type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, beside <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, with which it has much in common </plain></SENT>
