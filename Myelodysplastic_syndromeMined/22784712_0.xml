<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have indicated the Musashi2/NUMB pathway as the key regulator of differentiation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; however, a comparison of both gene expressions has not yet been made in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We herein, demonstrate a statistically significant down-modulation of NUMB expression level in high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, compared with control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MSI2 expression was significantly reduced in low and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NUMB expression was significantly lower than that of MSI2 in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patient samples, but no differences in the expression levels for either gene were observed in healthy bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, NUMB expression was significantly up-regulated during differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> CD34(+) cells through the erythroid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, results suggest the involvement of NUMB in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> erythropoiesis; its down-modulation may have a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
