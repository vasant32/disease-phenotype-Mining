<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>About 40% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) present with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, and they are facing different courses of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To advance the biological understanding and to find molecular prognostic markers, we performed a high-resolution oligonucleotide array study of 107 MDS patients (French American British) with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and clinical follow-up through the Duesseldorf <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recurrent hidden deletions overlapping with known cytogenetic aberrations or sites of known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated genes were identified in 4q24 (TET2, 2x), 5q31.2 (2x), 7q22.1 (3x) and 21q22.12 (RUNX1, 2x) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient with a 7q22.1 deletion had an additional 5q31.2 deletion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> region, the smallest deletion identified so far and including the putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor (ts) genes, EGR1 and CTNNA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One TET2 deletion was homozygous and one heterozygous, with a missense mutation in the remaining allele, further supporting its role as a ts gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides these recurrent alterations, additional individual imbalances were found in 34 cases; in total, 42/107 (39%) cases had genomic imbalances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients had an inferior survival as compared with the rest of the patients (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study emphasizes the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, but points to interesting genes that may have diagnostic and prognostic impact </plain></SENT>
