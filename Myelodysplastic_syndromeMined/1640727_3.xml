<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While a response occurs regularly, it has not been unequivocally resolved whether this effect is due to the stimulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemopoiesis or to induced maturation of the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether selective responses to colony-stimulating factors of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> versus abnormal clones occurred, cytogenetic analysis was performed on bone marrow cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients before and during in vivo treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A proliferation of additional clones could be demonstrated by karyotypic analysis in one patient during GM-CSF therapy and in two patients during rhEPO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients, initially with completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics, developed a mixture of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal metaphases during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients, initially with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormal metaphases, developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metaphases during treatment with GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mosaic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal metaphases was present in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of abnormal metaphases increased in three patients during GM-CSF treatment, and in one patient during rhEPO therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic anomalies in one patient persisted after clinical response to treatment, suggesting that GM-CSF enhanced maturation of the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that cytokine therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may have diverse effects on hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
