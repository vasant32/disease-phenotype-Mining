<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified a recurring translocation, t(1;3)(p36;p21), in eight patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>: three patients with ALL, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) in accelerated phase (AP), two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>(M3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of the eight patients had a history of chemotherapy, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> in three, before the translocation was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two of these five patients, the t(1;3)(p36;p21) emerged only at relapse or in the accelerated phase of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The karyotypes of the patients were complex, including -7 and structural abnormalities of 5q, 6q, 7q, 9p, and 11q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival time varied among patients (25 days to more than 16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using FISH with 13 1p35-36 cosmid probes (tel-FB12-CA5-G7-FD2-CB1-ED8-FD9-G32-AE3-G50-AD8-GG4-G43-cen), we delineated the 1p36 breakpoint in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and ALL as lying between FB12 and FD2 (between BAC47P3 and PAC963K15), with a small deletion near the breakpoint in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, there was also a deletion at 3p21.3, as detected with the cosmid probe cosNRL9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study suggest that t(1;3)(p36;p21) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> is associated with prior exposure to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi>, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
