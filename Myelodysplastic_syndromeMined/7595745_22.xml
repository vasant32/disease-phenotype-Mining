<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed a group of 127 AML/MDS patients who received IDA-based induction and postremission or salvage therapy and achieved a complete remission (CR) that lasted &gt; or = 12 weeks for the development of IDA-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> was defined as definite if a resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &lt; or = 45% measured by radionuclide ventriculogram (RV) accompanied the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, which had to be made during or within 6 months of receiving IDA and for which no other cause was apparent; without RV confirmation, the diagnosis was considered probable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who had RVs performed were evaluated for decreasing LVEF </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred fifteen patients were assessable (median age, 40 years; median dose, 96 mg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five had RVs performed during therapy; 43 had risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probability of IDA-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was 5% at a cumulative IDA dose of 150 to 290 mg/m2, with 18 patients receiving doses greater than 150 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a cumulative IDA dose of 150 mg/m2, the probability of a mild or greater asymptomatic decrease probability of a mild or greater asymptomatic decrease in LVEF (&gt; or = 10% to a level &lt; or = 50%) was 18%, whereas the probability of a moderate or greater asymptomatic decrease in LVEF (&gt; or = 15% to a level &lt; or = 45%) was 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient with asymptomatic LVEF decreases developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> was more frequent in patients with prior/sequential exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this patient group, IDA-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was uncommon with cumulative IDA doses of up to 290 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic LVEF decreases were more frequent, but their predictive value for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> is unclear </plain></SENT>
