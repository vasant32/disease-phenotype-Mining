<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ectopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> most commonly occurs in the liver and spleen but may, in fact, occur almost anywhere in the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although previous reports have documented <z:mp ids='MP_0000240'>EMH</z:mp> presenting as paraspinal masses, such lesions have almost always been associated with a predisposing hematological disorder such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors of this report describe the first reported instance of <z:mp ids='MP_0000240'>EMH</z:mp> in a patient presenting with a symptomatic epidural and paraspinal cervical lesion arising from the posterior spinal elements and no known predisposing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial radiographs revealed a bony lesion arising posteriorly from the C2-3 laminae and spinous processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent imaging suggested the diagnosis, which was confirmed by CT-guided biopsy, peripheral blood smears, and bone marrow aspirate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite epidural compression and slight displacement of the cervical cord and thecal sac, the patient's symptoms were limited to pain and diminished cervical range of motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, surgery was deferred in favor of nonsurgical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several alternative modalities for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0000240'>EMH</z:mp> have been suggested in the literature, including cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors opted for an approach utilizing directed low-dose radiotherapy of a total of 25 Gy divided in 2.5-Gy fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the 3-month follow-up, the patient continued to be asymptomatic, and MRI demonstrated a significant reduction in the dimensions of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>Extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> in the absence of a preexisting hematological disorder has not been described in the context of clinical neurosurgical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recognizing that <z:mp ids='MP_0000240'>EMH</z:mp> may present as an epidural or paraspinal lesion is important since chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective therapeutic options in the majority of patients who suffer few if any symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Extensive evaluation for underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> is necessary before undertaking directed therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Inadvertent resection of these highly vascularized masses may risk catastrophic intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> with no proven benefit as compared with medical treatment, which usually provides excellent long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
