<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 38 patients received nonmyeloablative regimens of 2 Gy total body irradiation alone (n=2) or with fludarabine (n=36), 90mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 112 patients received a myeloablative regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, 16mg/ kg (targeted to 800-900 ng/ml), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 120 mg/ kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonmyeloablative patients were older (median age 62 vs 52 years, P&lt;0.001), more frequently had progressed to tAML (53 vs 31%, P=0.06), had higher risk disease by the International Prognostic Scoring System (53 vs 30%, P=0.004), had higher transplant specific comorbidity indices (68 vs 42%, P=0.01) and more frequently had durable complete responses to induction chemotherapy (58 vs 14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-year overall survival (27%/48% (P=0.56)), progression-free survival (28%/4 44%, (P=0.60)), and nonrelapse mortality (41%/34%, (P=0.94)) did not differ significantly between nonmyeloblative/myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall (HR=0.9, P=0.84) and progression-free survivals (HR=1, P=0.93) were similar for patients with chemotherapy-induced remissions irrespective of conditioning intensity </plain></SENT>
