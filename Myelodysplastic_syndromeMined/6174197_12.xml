<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using FAB criteria, we retrospectively classified 195 adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> cases seen over a six-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) was separated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) by negative peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoietic syndrome</z:e> was separated from ANLL when the percentage of immature leukemic cells was less than 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 55 cases of ALL and 140 cases of ANLL thus defined were initially independently subclassified with Wright's stained smears by three observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were then jointly reviewed by using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available information, and a final consensus diagnosis was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For ALL, there was complete agreement (of initial independent observations) about subtype in 32 of 55 (58%); for only one case was there total disagreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For ANLL there was complete agreement in 89 of 140 (64%) and total disagreement in 5 of 140 (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequent disagreement of independent observations with the consensus diagnosis were L1 interpreted as 12, M5 interpreted as M4, L3 interpreted as L2, L2 interpreted as L1, M1 interpreted as M2 and M4 interpreted as M5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there appears to be variation between observers, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 6 of 195 cases had at least two observers in agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disagreement appeared to be partly based on varying interpretations of subjective criteria and partly on the variability in determining percentages of cell types present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of nonspecific esterase stain or lysozyme appeared to improve diagnostic agreement over that observed using Wright's stained slides alone in approximately 5% of cases of ANLL </plain></SENT>
