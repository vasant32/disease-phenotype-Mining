<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients have a drastically reduced life expectancy as compared to sensitive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore identifying predictive factors for AZA resistance is of great interest to propose alternative therapeutic strategies for non-responsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We generated AZA-resistant myeloid cell line (SKM1-R) that exhibited increased expression of BCL2L10 an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 member </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, BCL2L10 knockdown sensitized SKM1-R cells to AZA effect suggesting that increased BCL2L10 expression is linked to AZA resistance in SKM1-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We next established in 77 MDS patients that resistance to AZA is significantly correlated with the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells expressing BCL2L10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we showed that the proportion of BCL2L10 positive bone marrow cells can predict overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose a convenient assay in which the percentage of BCL2L10 expressing cells as assessed by flow cytometry is predictive of whether or not a patient will become resistant to AZA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, systematic determination of BCL2L10 expression could be of great interest in newly diagnosed and AZA-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
