<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation offers the sole possibility for cure and prolonged survival, but is only available for a minority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of PBPC collection and transplantation in 11 patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> who were not eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In six patients, PBPC were harvested after mobilization with G-CSF alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients were harvested during the recovery phase of intensive chemotherapy combined with G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This resulted in seven patients in an adequate CD34 progenitor yield &gt; 1 x 10(6)/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients obtained a CFU-GM content of the PBPC harvest &gt; 10 x 10(4)/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients were subsequently transplanted following a standard BuCy4 regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median to ANC (absolute neutrophil count) &gt; or = 0.5 and 1.0 x 10(9)/l was respectively 14 d (range 10-18) and 16 d (range 11-25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Platelets were self-supporting &gt; or = 20 x 10(9)/l after a median of 41 d (ranges 8-144) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had a persistent lack of platelet engraftment unresponsive to infusion of back-up bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that in selected patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, adequate PBPC collection appears feasible, enabling the harvest of sufficient cell numbers required for rapid and stable engraftment after reinfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Improvement in mobilization efficiency may enable the collection of higher CD34+ progenitor cell numbers required for more rapid platelet engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PBPC transplantation may be an alternative treatment option for patients who lack an allogeneic marrow donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow-up is, however, still too limited to draw any conclusion regarding the long-term cure rate </plain></SENT>
