<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> (BMF) syndrome, some are happened to have underlying Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA), a genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease, which is characterized by progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nature of the disease, a single genetic test, as in vitro response to DNA cross-linking agents, usually is not enough to make correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether measuring repair kinetics of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can distinguish Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> from other BMF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An early step in repair of DSBs is phosphorylation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H2AX, generating gamma-H2AX <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi>, which extends over mega base-pair regions of DNA from the break site and is visualised as foci (gamma-H2AX foci) with specific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary fibroblasts, established from FA patients, were exposed to gamma-rays, a dose of 2 Gy ((60)Co), incubated for up to 24 hours under repair-permissive conditions, and assayed for the level of gamma-H2AX foci and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> at different recovery times after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell lines originating from FA patients displayed a significant delay in the repair of radiation-induced DNA DSBs relative to non-FA <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> (non-FA BMF) and control cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The delay is especially evident at recovery time of 24 hours, and is seen as about 8-fold increase of residual gamma-H2AX foci compared to self-state before irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The delay in repair kinetics of FA cells represents the unique feature of FA <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp>, which should be exploited to distinguish FA <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
