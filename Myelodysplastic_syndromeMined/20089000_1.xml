<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetics (CC) cannot accurately define the specific alterations in CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) allows the comprehensive identification of CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, M-FISH was used in 16 patients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 22 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with CCA detected by R-banding CC, and revealed 206 aberrations involved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 24 chromosomes, including 73 numerical chromosomal abnormalities and 133 structural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes most often involved were, by decreasing incidence, 5, 17, 8, 11, 7 and 21 in 57.9%, 55.3%, 44.7%, 36.8%, 34.2% and 34.2% of the cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 98 unbalanced translocations, which were the most frequently observed aberrations in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Derivative chromosome 5 and 8 were implicated most often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other derivatives were der(11), der(12), der(7), der(14), der(15) and der(17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen balanced translocations were detected in our series, and the most frequent reciprocal translocations was t(8;21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomies</z:mp>, 15 partial deletions, and 18 <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most frequently observed were -5/5q-, -17/17q-, -7, -18, -21, -19, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosome 8 and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were some abnormalities that have not been previously described, including two complex t(8;21) and seven unbalanced translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>M-FISH could refine CCA, find or correct the missed or misidentified aberrations by CC analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings confirmed that M-FISH was a powerful molecular cytogenetic tool to characterize complex karyotypes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
