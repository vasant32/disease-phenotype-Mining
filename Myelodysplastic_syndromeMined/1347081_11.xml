<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PCNA immunostaining revealed the pattern of proliferation within individual haemopoietic lineages in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two unexpected observations were made: of erythroid cells, only pro-erythroblasts and occasional early normoblasts reacted, and positivity of megakaryocytes was unrelated to nuclear lobulation or CD61 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathological cases represented conditions in which haemopoiesis is increased (reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_338'>granulocytic leukaemia</z:mpath>, myeloproliferative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">megaloblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increases in the number, and disturbances of the spatial organization, of PCNA-expressing cells were present to a variable extent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sheets of PCNA-positive megaloblastoid erythrocytes were frequently found in myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative tissue, associated with marked disturbances in the spatial organization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> haemopoietic lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">megaloblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency also demonstrated greatly increased erythroid PCNA expression, with positivity in some giant metamyelocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to reflecting increased proliferation, elevated PCNA expression in some bone marrow pathologies may be due to altered kinetics of the protein induced by disturbances in growth factor production </plain></SENT>
