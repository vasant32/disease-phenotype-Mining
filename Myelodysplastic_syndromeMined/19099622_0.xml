<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 68 cases included 22 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 32 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and 14 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the complex chromosome abnormalities were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chromosomes of 68 cases, but the incidence of chromosome 5 abnormality was higher (38.2%, 26/68), including 45.5% (10/22) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 15.6% (5/32) in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and 78.6% (11/14) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common aberrations in chromosome 5 were unbalanced translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aberrations of chromosome 5 and chromosome 17 were confirmed simultaneously in 11 cases, the aberrations of chromosome 5 and chromosome 7 were confirmed simultaneously in 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the aberration of chromosome 5 is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e>, and presents unbalanced translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aberrations of chromosome 5 often accompany with aberrations of chromosome 7 or 17 </plain></SENT>
