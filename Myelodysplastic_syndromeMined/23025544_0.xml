<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the clinical importance of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> early transcript-1 (RAET1) polymorphism in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) by determining the frequency of 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and individual RAET1 alleles in 371 patient-donor pairs and relating this to clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A strong association was observed between the presence of five SNPs within the patient RAET1L (ULBP6) gene and relapse-free survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two common alleles of RAET1L were determined and the presence of the protective RAET1L*02 allele in the patient was associated with a relapse-free survival of 44% at 8 years compared with just 25% in patients who lacked a RAET1L*02 allele (P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at this time was 55% in those with RAET1L*02 allele compared to 39% in patients who lacked a RAET1L*02 allele (P = 0·003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These novel findings indicate a critical role for NKG2D-RAET1L interactions in determining SCT clinical outcome and show RAET1L may have an important influence on regulating the strength of the alloreactive immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data will be of value in guiding the development of future transplant therapy protocols </plain></SENT>
