<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AML1 is the human homolog of the recently cloned mouse gene pebp2 alpha B, homologous to the DNA binding alpha subunit of the polyoma enhancer factor pebp2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AML1 is also involved in a translocation with chromosome 3 that is seen in patients with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have isolated a fusion cDNA clone from a t(3;21) library derived from a patient with therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>; this clone contains sequences from AML1 and from EAP, which we have now localized to band 3q26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EAP has previously been characterized as a highly expressed small nuclear protein of 128 residues (EBER 1) associated with Epstein-Barr virus small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fusion clone contains the DNA binding 5' part of AML1 that is fused to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27561">ETO</z:chebi> in the t(8;21) and, in addition, at least one other exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The translocation replaces the last nine codons of AML1 with the last 96 codons of EAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fusion does not maintain the correct reading frame of EAP and may not lead to a functional chimeric protein </plain></SENT>
