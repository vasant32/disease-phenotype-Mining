<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The serum concentration of erythropoietin in 79 cases with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uremia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> etc was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At comparable degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> had the highest levels of erythropoietin in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high level of erythropoietin titer in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> should be taken as the nom for renal synthesis and release of this hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The erythropoietin level in patients with uremic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was lower than the level in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of other causes but still higher than that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000113'>polycystic kidney disease</z:hpo> with or without <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uremia</z:mp> had a high level of erythropoietin due to local <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> of remnant kidney tissue resulting from the pressure of cystic formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different methods are used to determine the erythropoietin level, which varies with the stage and etiology of the diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are other stimulating or inhibitory factors of erythropoiesis when the assay is processed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transfusion and administration of certain drugs also influence the growth of erythroid cells, thus the serum titers of erythropoietin differed markedly between patients at comparable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
