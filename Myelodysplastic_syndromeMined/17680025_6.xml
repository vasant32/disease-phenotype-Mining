<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 286 patients and their donors for the CYP2C19 gene who underwent allogeneic transplantation for various diseases and analyzed their outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as: poor metabolizers (PMs; 3.1%), intermediate metabolizers (IMs; 24.5%) and extensive metabolizers (EMs; 72.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients genotyped as PMs had significant higher hepato- and nephrotoxicities compared to IMs or EMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maximum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels measured after transplant were approximately twofold higher than those of EMs or IMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increased toxicity resulted in an increased 4-year estimate for transplant-related mortality (TRM) with 50+/-18.6% for PMs compared to 25.1+/-3.7% for EMs (P&lt;0.018) and 22.7 +/-5.6% for IMs (P&lt;0.042), whereas no significant influence for relapse rate, overall survival or incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> grade 2-4 were found between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potential factors that might influence TRM confirmed that the genotype of CYP2C19 is an independent factor, which influenced TRM significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that genotyping for CYP450 2C19 can help to identify patients with higher risk for TRM </plain></SENT>
