<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From January 2001 to January 2003, 22 patients agreed to receive enteral nutrition via a nasogastric feeding tube; the remaining 23 patients received parenteral nutrition (n=22) or standard oral feeding (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early complications and factors influencing 100-day overall survival (OS) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who received enteral nutrition developed less often <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-grade III/IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (18%) than those who did not (35%) (P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, this group showed lower mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> during the first 100 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, only the absence of enteral nutrition was found to adversely influence 100-day OS with a hazard ratio of 8.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enteral nutrition is a safe and effective method for feeding allo-SCT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A randomized trial is warranted to confirm its advantage on early patient outcome </plain></SENT>
