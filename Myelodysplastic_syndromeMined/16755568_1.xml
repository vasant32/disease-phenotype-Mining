<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>M6c (mixed myeloblast/pronormoblast) has also been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is still defined according to the percentage of myeloblasts (% myeloblasts) without including the pronormoblast count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 20-year retrospective study was performed to identify cases demonstrating &gt;or=50% erythrocytic component and &lt;30% calculated blasts (FAB exclusion criteria) without underlying cause (96 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pronormoblast and myeloblast counts and other variables were analyzed as possible explanatory variables of the variations in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considered alone, increasing % myeloblasts and/or percentage of pronormoblasts (% pronormoblasts) were significant predictors of decreasing survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables were considered as a multivariate group, the best fitting statistical model for predicting survival was a function of age, % pronormoblasts, IPSS cytopenias, platelet count, and percentage erythrocytic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, % pronormoblasts was by far the most significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonappearance of % myeloblasts in this model is indicative of high correlations of this count with other variables </plain></SENT>
