<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case, as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases published in the literature, the karyotypes of the affected cells contained two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes #1, but only one chromosome #7, with the result that the basic karyotype was 46, -7, +t(1;7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This chromosome change is not geographically restricted, and appears to characterize a group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, including myeloproliferative syndromes, in whom exposure to previous chemotherapy, x-rays, or drugs is in the background history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The t(1;7) in secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and myeloproliferative syndromes serves to duplicate the long arm of a chromosome #1 and to rescue the short arm of a chromosome #7 </plain></SENT>
