<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> (IA) is a leading cause of mortality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Management of IA is expensive, which makes prevention desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because hospital resources are limited, prevention costs have to be compared with treatment costs and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 269 patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) during 2002-2007, evidence of IA was collected using high-resolution computed tomography and galactomannan measurement in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IA was classified on the basis of updated European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16551">Mycoses</z:chebi> Study Group definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic and therapeutic IA-related costs, corrected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> duration, were comprehensively analyzed from a hospital perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">Voriconazole</z:chebi> treatment was given orally from day 1 if possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 80 patients developed IA; 48 (18%) had probable or proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and 32 (12%) had possible IA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi>; 55 (75%) took oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> from day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with IA, the mortality rate 12 weeks after starting antifungal therapy was 22% (16 of 73 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate, registered 12 weeks after neutrophil recovery from the last dose of antileukemic treatment, was 26% in patients with IA versus 16% in patients without IA (P = .08), reflecting an IA-attributable mortality rate of 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a Cox regression analysis, IA was associated with an increased mortality risk (hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Total IA-related costs increased to euro 8360 and euro 15,280 for patients with possible and probable or proven IA, respectively, compared with patients without IA (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and treatment of IA with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> result in acceptable mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, IA continues to have substantial attributable mortality combined with a major impact on hospital resource use, so effective prevention in high-incidence populations has the potential to save lives and costs </plain></SENT>
