<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In vitro colony formation by erythroid progenitors from the bone marrow was studied in 42 patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> using both a standard assay for growing erythroid colonies and an assay designed for growing megakaryocyte colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the standard assay 5 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> numbers of erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) colonies, 8 showed reduced numbers of colonies, and 29 patients had no colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients with markedly reduced numbers of erythroid colonies or no colonies at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the standard assay showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased numbers of erythroid colonies in the megakaryocyte assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In three of these patients the erythroid colony <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, whereas the other three showed abundant diffuse growth of erythroid subclusters with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other patients, the erythroid culture results were similar in both assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the impairment of erythroid colony growth seen in most patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> is, at least in a number of patients, not due to reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors but to unusual milieu requirements of abnormal progenitors </plain></SENT>
