<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: MUTZ-1 cells were treated with As2S3 nano and traditional regular-sized particles (TRSP) at different concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell growth inhibition rate was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and flow cytometry (FCM), cell cycle by FCM and the activity of caspase-3 by chemiluminescence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of As2S3 nano and TRSP at concentrations of 2, 4, 8 and 16 micromol/L for 48 h could lead to a significant dose-dependent decrease of MUTZ-1 cells and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentages of inhibition were 48.9%, 75.9%, 89.4% and 96.5% in As2S3 nano vs 14.5%, 25.4%, 34.7% and 51.5% in TRSP and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rates were (12.9 +/- 1.9)%, (19.2 +/- 2.2)%, (30.1 +/- 2.5)% and (45.9 +/- 2.3)% in As2S3 nano vs (5.3 +/- 1.8%)%, (11.1 +/- 2.6)%, (19.3 +/- 2.3)% and (25.5 +/- 2.5)% in TRSP respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was statistically significant difference in these two groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of cell in G2/M phase and the activity of caspase-3 of MUTZ-1 cells treated with A2S32 nano were significantly higher than those treated with control group and As2S3 TRSP groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As2S3 nanoparticles and TRSP can inhibit the proliferation of MUTZ-1 cells and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which maybe through activating caspase-3 pathways and increasing the proportion of G2/M phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As2S3 nanoparticles can produce a much better antitumor effect than As2S3 TRSP do </plain></SENT>
