<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LT free survival of the D group had significant advantage over that of the N group according to the Kaplan-Meier method (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 7 cases in the N group developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, in contrast to only one in the D group (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that oral administration of 1-hydroxyvitamin D3 prevents the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> under the effect of differentiation capacity from blasts to monocytes </plain></SENT>
