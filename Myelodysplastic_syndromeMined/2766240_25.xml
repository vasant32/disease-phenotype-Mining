<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some degree of overt clinical progression occurred in 55 patients (22%), this being 29% of those patients with cytogenetic abnormalities and 17% of those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence and complexity of a clonal cytogenetic abnormality correlated with shorter survival </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analyses, the prognostic value of chromosomes was independent of (and second in importance to) the FAB type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) whichever chromosome classification was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) had the lowest incidence of chromosome abnormalities and no cases were found to have only abnormal cells (AA) </plain></SENT>
