<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By chromosome <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, deletions consistently involved bands q14 and q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to confirming the chromosome data, FISH allowed us to delineate a commonly deleted region that was flanked by YAC 833A2 and YAC 854D4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three cases with 13q translocations unexpectedly showed accompanying cryptic microdeletions of 13q, and in one case the commonly deleted region could be narrowed to a genomic segment, which includes YAC 937C7, RB1, and YAC 745E3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homozygous deletions were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This region overlaps with the smallest deleted region of 13q14 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
