<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the mechanism of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, we investigated the proliferation of eosinophil colony-forming units (CFU-Eo) in nine patients and four healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eosinophil clusters increased significantly in the patients (P &lt; 0.01) compared with controls, but eosinophil colonies were not different between controls and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the eosinophil clusters were significantly increased with rhGM-CSF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients compared with controls, although serum GM-CSF concentrations were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that eosinophil clusters are increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> either through abnormal progenitor proliferation or hypersensitivity to GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
