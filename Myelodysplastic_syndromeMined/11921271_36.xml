<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recurring translocation partners were 9p22 (48%), 19p13.3 (11%), 19p13.1 (10%), 4q21 (9%), 6q27 (6%), 1p32 (2%), 16p13.1 (2%), 10p13 (1%), and 17q25 (1%); in 9%, the translocations were seen only once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining 349 patients were divided into five subgroups based on the balanced aberration: 21q22, inv(16), t(15;17), Rare, and Unique aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in the 11q23 subgroup had a sole cytogenetic abnormality more often than those in the 21q22, inv(16), Rare, and Unique subgroups, and a complex karyotype or -5/del(5q) and/or -7/del(7q) less often than patients in the 21q22, Rare, and Unique subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically, 11q23 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) more often as their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> and a shorter latency from start of treatment for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> to their t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/t-AL diagnosis, except when compared with the inv(16) subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 11q23 subgroup demonstrated a younger age at t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/t-AL diagnosis, but this finding was not significant when patients with AL as their primary diagnosis were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival from the time of diagnosis of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/t-AL was significantly shorter for the 11q23 subgroup compared with that of the 21q22, inv(16), and t(15;17) subgroups (median 8 vs. 14, 28, and 29 months, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inferior survival occurred even though 11q23 patients were younger and more often received blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even among patients receiving BMT, 11q23 patients had a shorter median survival (9 vs. 12-31 months for the other subgroups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, among 11q23 patients, those receiving BMT survived longer, with 1- and 5-year survivals of 43% and 18% compared with 23% and 7% for patients not transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With regard to prior therapy, 11q23 patients, compared with other patients, received radiotherapy less often as their sole therapy and chemotherapy more often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6MP</z:chebi>/6TG, L-asparaginase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and VM26 more often, likely attributed to the high frequency of AL as their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More patients in the 11q23 subgroup had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, except in comparison with the 21q22 subgroup; more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, except in comparison with the Rare and Unique subgroups; and more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, except in comparison with the Unique subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients in the 11q23 subgroup more often received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> (AAs) (86% vs. 59-82% for the other subgroups), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> (TIs) (84% vs. 49-75%), and they more often reported exposure to AAs plus TIs without radiotherapy (33% vs. 12-21%), except in comparison with the 21q22 subgroup (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We performed a multivariate analysis to determine whether the adverse survival of 11q23 patients compared to other Workshop patients was explained by factors other than the presence of the 11q23 abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Covariates in the final model were the five cytogenetic subgroup indicators, where the 11q23 subgroup was the referent (P &lt; 0.0001); age at t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/t-AL (P = 0.0036); previous exposure to lomustine (P &lt; 0.0001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (P = 0.0225); BMT for t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/t-AL (P = 0.0006); and karyotype complexity (P = 0.0114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for 11q23 patients relative to patients in the 21q22, inv(16), t(15;17), and Unique subgroups was significant, even after adjustment for other risk factors (relative risks 2.3, 3.6, 3.1, and 1.5, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001 for the first three comparisons and P = 0.0125 for the last) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>When a multivariable model was constructed, excluding patients with AL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as their primary diagnosis, the relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for 11q23 patients was significantly higher than that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five other cytogenetic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We conclude that among t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/t-AL patients with balanced aberrations, 11q23 translocations are an independent adverse risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although BMT is the current therapy of choice, new treatment is required </plain></SENT>
