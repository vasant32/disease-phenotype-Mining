<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> subtypes were distributed as follows: 14 refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (RA), four refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with ringed sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), and 12 refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age ranged from 40 to 81 years (median 70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of these had previously received treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> other than supportive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>9CRA (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50648">Alitretinoin</z:chebi> capsules, kindly provided by Allergan-Ligand <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">Retinoid</z:chebi> Therapeutics) was given daily at 60 mg/m2 p.o. for 1 week, followed by an intra-patient escalation to 100 mg/m2 during the second week, up to a maximum of 140 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The planned treatment duration was 48 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five were available for assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient (4%) with RA achieved complete hematological remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four (16%), two with RA, two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, had minor responses resulting in decreased transfusion requirements or increased neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the overall response rate was 20% in evaluable patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 17% in the study group on an intention-to-treat basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequent side-effects included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (77%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000958'>dry skin</z:hpo> (57%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> (30%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although modest responses were noted in this study, the treatment tolerability was suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that a lower dosage schedule may be efficacious and better tolerated so enabling prolonged exposure which may be required to induce a differentiation effect </plain></SENT>
