<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received 20 mg/m2/day s.c </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Courses were repeated after 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 11 evaluable patients, results according to FAB-classified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were as follows: RA, 1/2 response (R), 1/2 stable disease (SD); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, 2/3 R, 1/3 SD; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, 1/6 CR, 1/6 PR, 2/6 R, 2/6 progression; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMML</z:e>, 1/2 SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e>, overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> was observed 2 and 10 weeks after initiation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With few exceptions, treatment resulted in a prompt increase in granulocytes and eosinophiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was associated with improvement of infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increases in red cells and platelets occurred variably and was apparently associated with responses of the underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dose limiting side effects consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, severe <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and dolent local reactions at the site of GM-CSF injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and diarrhoea occurred frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Less often, respiratory and cardiovascular side effects were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, GM-CSF +/- Ara-C in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> results in objective remission with manageable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conceivably, this regimen will serve as a base for future treatment strategies against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
