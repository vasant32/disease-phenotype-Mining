<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have undertaken a systematic comparison of standard cytogenetic analysis and molecular analysis for the detection of such loss, using as a model loss of chromosome 7 in 72 patients with a clonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large number of probes was used to screen three regions of chromosome 7 for loss by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were nine cases in which loss of chromosome 7 was detected by both techniques, but seven in which loss was detected by only one of the methods, demonstrating the complementary nature of these two techniques </plain></SENT>
