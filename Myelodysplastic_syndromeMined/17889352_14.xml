<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transplants were performed at a single institution between 1995 and 2004, and outcomes were analyzed according to time intervals from transplantation to detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>: "early," &lt;100 days (n = 111); "intermediate," 100-200 days (n = 73); and "late," &gt;200 days (n = 123) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall remission rate was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to early recurrence, intermediate recurrence and late recurrence were associated with increasing probabilities of remission (hazard ratios, 1.89 and 2.16; P = .05 and .02) and decreasing risks of overall mortality (hazard ratios, 0.73 and 0.33; P = .05 and &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2-year overall survival (OS) estimates for patients with early, intermediate, and late recurrence were 3%, 9%, and 19%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remission was associated with a median survival prolongation of 9.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individual types or combinations of these nonrandomly assigned relapse-directed interventions were not associated with higher or lower probabilities of remission or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More effective intervention strategies are needed for treatment of recurrent high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> after hematopoietic cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the absence of innovative clinical trials, patients with early recurrence might wish to forego further interventions in favor of palliative care </plain></SENT>
