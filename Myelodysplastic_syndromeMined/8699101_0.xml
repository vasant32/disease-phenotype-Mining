<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An 83-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011134'>low grade fever</z:hpo> on April 19, 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission, hematological data were as follows: WBC 1,000/microliters with 19% neutrophils, RBC 367 x 10(4)/microliters, Hb 9.5 g/dl and platelets 6.7 x 10(4)/microliters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination revealed 6.6% myeloblasts and 33.5% erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphological abnormalities included hypersegmentation, degranulation and pseudo-Pelger's nuclear anomaly in neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was made and therapy with low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">Cytarabine</z:chebi> (Ara-C) was initiated in April 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient had two episodes of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in June and July </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 75 micrograms/day of G-CSF was given in addition to antibiotic therapy for the second episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in July </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter the severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> subsided, and G-CSF administration was switched to an intermittent schedule (75 micrograms twice a week) since September </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">Cytarabine</z:chebi> ocfosfate (100 mg/day) was added for 10-14 days at interval 1-2 months from October,1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He has been well with no episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> for more than two year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One major concern regarding the clinical application of G-CSF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is related to the possible stimulation of leukemic cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Frequent hematological monitoring is necessary in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> who are prone to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, we administered G-CSF at a relatively low dose twice a week for over two year and could successfully prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> without inducing the leukemic changes </plain></SENT>
