<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry might add significantly to diagnostic and prognostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our analysis of bone marrow samples from 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showed aberrant expression of differentiation antigens in the myelomonocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This also accounted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) with or without ringed sideroblasts (RS), indicating multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 38% of patients, CD34(+) myeloid blasts expressed CD5, CD7, or CD56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry data were translated into a numerical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> flow-score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow-scores increased significantly from RA with or without RS, refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) with or without RS up to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts-1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-1</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-2</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between WHO cytogenetic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow-scores were highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> within International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in progression to advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> had a significantly higher flow-score compared with non-transfusion-dependent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 60% of patients with transfusion dependency or progressive disease, myeloid blasts expressed CD7 or CD56, in contrast to only 9% of non-transfusion-dependent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with pure RA with or without RS with aberrant myeloid blasts showed an adverse clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, flow cytometry in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> identified aberrancies in the myelomonocytic lineage not otherwise determined by cytomorphology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, flow cytometry identified patients at risk for transfusion dependency and/or progressive disease independent of known risk groups, which might have impact on treatment decisions and the prognostic scoring system in the near future </plain></SENT>
