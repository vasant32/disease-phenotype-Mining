<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the morphologic findings of archival bone marrow specimens with M4Eo, specifically assessing for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and performed immunohistochemical studies to assess the growth fraction using the MIB-1 (Ki-67) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the apoptotic rate by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-nick end labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> assessable cases had more than 10% dysplastic forms in at least 1 lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases had 10% or more dysplastic forms, and 3 cases had more than 50% dysplastic forms in at least 2 lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for Ki-67 was higher in M4Eo than in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> types (P = .000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic rate in M4Eo was similar to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> types (P = .724) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data show that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is a prominent feature, but not a prognostic indicator, in M4Eo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>M4Eo is associated with a significantly higher proliferation rate than other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
