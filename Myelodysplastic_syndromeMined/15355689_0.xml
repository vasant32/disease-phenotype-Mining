<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNAs from 194 cases of AL were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis for FLT3-ITD mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FLT3-ITDs were found in 37 (25.9%) of 143 de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeoloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients, including 10/53 of M(2), 15/40 of M(3), 4/20 of M(4) and 8/23 of M(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly more FLT3 aberrations were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M(3) and M(5) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No FLT3-ITD was found in 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hybrid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of 5 cases with abnormal PCR electrophoretic patterns revealed that the ITDs were located within exon 14 from 21 bp to 60 bp, in 3 cases the ITD was a simple tandem duplication, and in 2 cases the ITD was tandem duplication with insertion, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the above ITD did not altered the FLT3 reading frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FLT3-ITD was associated with a higher peripheral white cell count (P &lt; 0.05) and a lower complete remission rate (P &lt; 0.05), and was more prevalent in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FLT3-ITD mutation occurs with a significant percentage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M(3) and M(5) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequences of the mutants are in frame mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FLT3-ITD mutation was associated with a higher peripheral white cell count and a lower complete remission rate </plain></SENT>
