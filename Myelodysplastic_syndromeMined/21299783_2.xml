<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> between 1 January 2002 and 1 September 2007 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their bone marrow biopsy, clinical record, cytogenetic analysis and transfusion record were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy myelodysplastic patients were identified yielding an incidence of 2.75 per 100,000 per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 23 months, and transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> occurred in five patients (7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients (4.3%) received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and five patients (7.1%) received disease modifying treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six of 70 patients (80%) received a blood transfusion, a mean of 32.9 red blood cell (RBC) units were transfused to each transfusion recipient during the study period of 68 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of 70 patients developed a clinical syndrome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> in Wellington, NZ is similar to incidence figures from previously published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment these patients received was predominantly supportive through RBC transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Effective iron chelation therapy measures were not used although there appeared to be a low incidence of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data in this study will be available for comparison with future studies to assess trends in incidence, treatment and outcome in myelodysplastic patients in NZ </plain></SENT>
