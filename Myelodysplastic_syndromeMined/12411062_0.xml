<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the four techniques for clonal analysis in the early diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four techniques for clonal analysis were performed in bone marrow samples from fifty patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>: (1) Conventional cytogenetics (CC) for clonal chromosomal abnormalities; (2) BrdU-sister chromatid differentiation (BrdU-SCD) for cell cycle analysis; (3) Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8; (4) PCR-SSCP for N-ras mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnosis of forty-five patients was compatible with FAB criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the other five patients didn't fully meet the FAB criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They had either only one lineage dyspoiesis or no any obvious dysplastic features and two of them were diagnosed as suspicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), one as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with hypercellular bone marrow and two as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the four techniques performed in them showed that four patients had clonal karyotype abnormalities, two had prolonged cell cycle, three had <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 of different proportions, and one had N-ras mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, they were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnosed as RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The untypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients can be diagnosed early by examination with combining several clonal analysis techniques </plain></SENT>
