<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin is a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> which controls red blood cell production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human erythropoietin, 50 U/kg/day, was given subcutaneously to 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient was transfusion dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diverse pretreatment endogenous serum erythropoietin levels were noted and ranged from 17 to 3616 IU/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients (12.5%) demonstrated an improvement in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels obviating the need for transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their responses lasted 5+ and 7 months with maintenance erythropoietin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The responders had endogenous serum erythropoietin levels of 44 and 170, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment was generally tolerated without constitutional side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, three patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and one developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, six patients showed changes in non-erythroid cells: two patients had an increase in platelet counts; three patients, a decrease in platelet counts; and one patient, an increase in white blood cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of these changes reversed rapidly once erythropoietin was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that (a) serum erythropoietin levels are extremely variable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, (b) only a minority of patients benefit from treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin, and (c) erythropoietin can affect cells of the myeloid and megakaryocytic lineage in a small proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
