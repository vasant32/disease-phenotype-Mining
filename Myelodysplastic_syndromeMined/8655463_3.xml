<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HDMP was administered orally at a single dose of 20-30 mg/kg/day combined with low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (LD Ara-C) (10 mg/m2, 12-hourly s.c.) for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment continued with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (10 mg/m2, i.v.) and Ara-C (5 mg/kg, i.v.) once a week for four doses followed by maintenance chemotherapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extramedullary infiltration disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases within 2 weeks to 3 months after initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the exception of two patients who relapsed 6 and 24 months after remission, treatment could be stopped in others who remained in remission for 36 months without evidence of EMI; 6 months later one of them developed myelodysplastic relapse (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
