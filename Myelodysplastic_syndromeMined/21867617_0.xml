<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>That is to say if there are abnormal clones in CD34(+)CD38(-) and CD34(+)CD38(+) cells and their proportions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immuno-magnetic bead technique was used to sort CD34(+)CD38(-) and CD34(+)CD38(+) in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 9 MDS patients with chromosome abnormalities (four cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, 1 case with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 complex karyotype, 2 cases with 5q(-), 1 case with 5q(-)complex karyotype, 1 case with 5q(-) accompanying <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8) and smears were made respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then the percentage of abnormal clones in CD34(+)CD38(-) and CD34(+)CD38(+) cells were compared by using FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that abnormal clones were involved in the two population cells in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of abnormal clones in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells (41.8 ± 8.4%)was obviously lower than that in CD34(+)CD38(+) cells(72.4 ± 7.7%) (p &lt; 0.001), and the percentage of abnormal clones in karyocytes was 70.8 ± 9.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded the abnormal clones of bone marrow hematopoietic cells may originate from stem cell stage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with 5q(-) and +8, and the abnormal clones are predominant at stage of progenitors </plain></SENT>
