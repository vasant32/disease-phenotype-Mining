<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are limited reports of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients exposed to erythropoiesis stimulating agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether erythropoiesis stimulating agents are associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, as they are among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The association between use of erythropoiesis stimulating agent and transient <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> was assessed in a case-crossover study nested within a cohort of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare-linked database, cases with an incident diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using conditional logistical regression, the odds of exposure to erythropoiesis stimulating agents in the 12 weeks prior to the incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (hazard period) was compared to the exposure odds in a prior 12-week comparison period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within the cohort of eligibles with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (n = 5,673) there were 212 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 76.2 (standard deviation = Â± 8.6) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> in the crude nor the adjusted models (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.60, 2.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Central venous catheter placement (OR = 6.47, 95% CI: 2.37, 17.62) and red blood cell transfusion (OR = 4.60, 95% CI: 2.29, 9.23) were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the link between use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, this study provides evidence that their safety profile may be different among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
