<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine this possibility, we analyzed clinical outcomes in a cohort of 105 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> who received T cell-replete grafts from HLA-matched sibling donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presence of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) for nonself HLA class I ligands had no effect on disease-free survival, incidence of relapse, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal analysis of the NK-cell repertoire and function revealed a global hyporesponsiveness of NK cells early after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional responses recovered at approximately 6 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, NKG2A(-) NK cells expressing KIRs for nonself HLA class I ligands remained tolerant at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a direct comparison of NK-cell reconstitution in T cell-replete and T cell-depleted HLA-matched sibling stem cell transplantation (SCT) revealed that NKG2A(+) NK cells dominated the functional repertoire early after transplantation, with intact tolerance of NKG2A(-) NK cells expressing KIRs for nonself ligands in both settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results provide evidence against the emergence of alloreactive NK cells in HLA-identical allogeneic SCT </plain></SENT>
