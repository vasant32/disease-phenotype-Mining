<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three groups received flu vaccine: healthy controls, hematologic patients not treated with rHuEPO ("No EPO" group), and hematologic patients receiving rHuEPO for their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> ("EPO" group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-flu Ab titer was measured (complement fixation test) from blood samples drawn before and approximately 3-4 weeks, 7-8 weeks and 4 months after vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen healthy subjects were compared with 17 No EPO and 17 EPO patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean ages were 59.5, 61.3, and 73.1 years, respectively (EPO patients were older; p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the healthy group, the percentage of those sustaining only a partial (twofold) response, a strong (fourfold or greater) response, and an overall response (combined partial and strong responses) were 31.6%, 57.9%, and 89.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the No EPO group, values were 35.3%, 17.6%, and 52.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EPO group results were similar to those of the healthy controls: 23.5%, 58.8%, and 82.4% (p = 0.016, EPO vs. No EPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, hematologic patients (NoEPO group) respond poorly to the flu vaccine, compared with healthy subjects, and rHuEPO treatment is associated with an improved immune response to the flu vaccine in hematologic patients, with titers similar to those of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
