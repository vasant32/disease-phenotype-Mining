<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) have ineffective in vivo and in vitro erythropoiesis, characterized by an impaired response to erythropoietin (Epo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined proliferation and maturation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> marrow cells in response to Epo in more detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epo-dependent DNA synthesis as well as induction of GATA-1 binding activity in marrow cells from 15 MDS cases were severely reduced as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (NBM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the appearance of morphologically identifiable erythroid cells was decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that both the Epo-dependent proliferation as well as the differentiation induction by Epo is suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To study more upstream events of the Epo signal transduction route we investigated activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 MDS samples tested, STAT5 activation was absent or greatly suppressed in response to Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, interleukin-3 induced a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> STAT5 response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the subset of CD71+ BM cells that is phenotypically similar to Epo-responsive cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow, was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the Epo response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is disturbed at an early point in the Epo-receptor (EpoR) signal transduction pathway </plain></SENT>
