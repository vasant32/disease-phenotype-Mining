<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Pharmacologic differentiating agents have had relatively limited clinical success outside of the use of ATRA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The differentiating effects of such agents can be enhanced in combination with lineage-specific growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a dose finding trial to assess toxicity, differentiating activity, and clinical impact of the combination of bryostatin-1 and GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with poor risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> were eligible to enroll in a dose finding study of continuous infusion bryostatin-1 combined with a fixed dose of daily GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toxicities were graded per NCI CTC version 2.0 and pharmacokinetic and correlative study samples were obtained to assess the combination's clinical and biologic differentiating effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were treated with the combination therapy and the dose determined to be most suitable for study in a larger trial was continuous infusion broystatin-1 at 16μg/m(2) for 14 days and subcutaneous GM-CSF at 125μg/m(2) daily for 14 days every 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>Arthralgias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgias</z:hpo> limited further dose escalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the combination impacted differentiation with improvement of absolute neutrophil counts (p=0.0001) in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there were two objective clinical responses, including a CR after a single cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the bryostatin-1 plasma concentrations and the correlative studies supported biologic activity of the combination at the doses where clinical responses were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combining growth factors with pharmacologic differentiating agents may increase their clinical effectiveness and further studies should focus on such combinations </plain></SENT>
