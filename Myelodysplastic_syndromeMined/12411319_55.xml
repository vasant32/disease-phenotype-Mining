<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD34(+) cells were isolated by magnetic cell separation, and high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For confirmation, the expression of selected genes was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Class membership prediction analysis selected 11 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the expression profile of these genes, we were able to discriminate patients with low-risk from patients with high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and both patient groups from the control group by hierarchical clustering (Spearman confidence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The power of these 11 genes was verified by applying the algorithm to an unknown test set containing expression data from 8 additional patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (3 at low risk, 5 at high risk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients at low risk could be distinguished from those at high risk by clustering analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, we found that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic-acid</z:chebi>-induced gene (RAI3), the radiation-inducible, immediate-early response gene (IEX1), and the stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) were down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that CD34(+) cells from patients with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> lack defensive proteins, resulting in their susceptibility to cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, we propose that gene expression profiling may have clinical relevance for risk evaluation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> at the time of initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study provides evidence that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, hematopoietic stem cells accumulate defects that prevent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
