<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities are predominantly characterized by total/partial chromosomal losses or gains and rarely by balanced structural aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 8 represents the most common chromosomal gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the numerical aberration of chromosome 8 was evaluated by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and the results compared with those of conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty adult patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, 17 with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and 13 with several chromosomal abnormalities except chromosome 8, were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On comparing the results of FISH and conventional cytogenetics, a superiority of FISH over the karyotype was detected in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one of them, further cytogenetic analysis confirmed the FISH results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the FISH technique has limitations, detecting only abnormalities specific for the target FISH probe used In clinical practice, conventional cytogenetics continues to be the basic technique for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, a large number of metaphases, even those of poor quality, must be analyzed in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FISH technique could be considered to be complementary to achieve a more accurate analysis </plain></SENT>
