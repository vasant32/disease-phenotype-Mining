<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of TP53 mutations and the level of p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in low-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with del(5q) and to assess their impact on disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pre- and postprogression bone marrow (BM) samples from 55 consecutive patients with International Prognostic Scoring System low risk (n = 32) or intermediate-1 risk (n = 23) were studied by next-generation sequencing of TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IHC for p53 was performed on 148 sequential BM samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TP53 mutations with a median clone size of 11% (range, 1% to 54%) were detected in 10 patients (18%) already at an early phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations were equally common in low-risk and intermediate-1-risk patients and were associated with evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (5 of 10 v 7 of 45; P = .045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of 10 patients carrying mutations showed more than 2% BM progenitors with strong p53 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of a complete cytogenetic response to lenalidomide was lower in mutated patients (0 of 7 v 12 of 24; P = .024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: By using sensitive deep-sequencing technology, we demonstrated that TP53 mutated populations may occur at an early disease stage in almost a fifth of low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with del(5q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, mutations were present years before disease progression and were associated with an increased risk of leukemic evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutations could not be predicted by common clinical features but were associated with p53 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate a previously unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the disease which may significantly affect clinical decision making </plain></SENT>
