<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other cellular features of FA cells are hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and accelerated telomere shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have quantified overall genome chromosome fragility and euploidy as well as chromosomes 7 and 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in peripheral blood lymphocytes from a group of FA patients and age-matched controls that were previously measured for telomere length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The haematology of FA samples were also characterized in terms of whole blood cell, neuthrophil and platelet counts, transfusion dependency, requirement of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>, cortico-steroids or bone marrow transplantation, and the development of bone marrow clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As expected, a high frequency of spontaneous chromosome breaks was observed in FA patients, especially of chromatid-type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences in chromosomes 7 and 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp>, polysomy and non-disjunction were detected between FA patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same was true for overall genome haploidy or <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the spontaneous levels of chromosome fragility but not of numerical abnormalities were correlated to the severity of the haematological disease in FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the variables included in the present investigation (chromosome fragility, chromosome numerical abnormalities and haematological status) were correlated to telomere length </plain></SENT>
