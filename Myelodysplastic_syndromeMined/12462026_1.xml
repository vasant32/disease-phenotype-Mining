<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was combined in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients who consisted of 4 treated with CyA, 3 with ATG/CyA, and one with ATG, achieved transfusion-independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responses were observed in 8/9 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, 0/3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blast, although the recovery was incomplete in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the CyA-responsive patients took drug-dependent courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of GPI-anchored protein-deficient granulocytes (CD11b+CD55-CD59-) was examined by flow cytometry after treatment in 6 responsive patients, and was demonstrated in 2 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR15 was found in 5 of 7 responsive patients, suggesting that the presence of this allele may be associated with a good response to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responsive patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> classified to IPSS Int-1, and had common conditions as follows: absence of chromosomal abnormality, short interval from diagnosis to therapy, and employment of ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
