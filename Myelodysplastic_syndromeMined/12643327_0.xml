<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The changes in prothrombin time (PT) ratio, fibrinogen, fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), antithrombin, and protein C, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex (PPIC), and soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> were significant during the clinical course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, but those of D-dimer, thrombomodulin (TM), tissue factor (TF), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and PT were significantly longer in the poor response group than in good response group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of FDP, TAT, PPIC, SFMC, TM, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> score were significantly higher in poor response group than in good response </plain></SENT>
