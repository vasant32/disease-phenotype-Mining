<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had myeloid transformation according to FAB criteria, but coexpression of lymphoid-associated antigens was detected in five of the 20 patients who underwent an immunophenotypic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was also observed in one of the five patients who coexpressed lymphoid markers and that of the T-cell receptor beta chain gene in another one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None had pure lymphoid transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were noted in 12 (63%) of the 19 patients who underwent cytogenetic study, most commonly - 7 (six patients or 32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 18 patients who underwent serial analyses both at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis and at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformation, seven (39%) underwent karyotypic evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common new or additional aberrations were +8 and +21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>N-ras gene mutation was detected in two of the nine patients at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median interval from diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transformation was 10 months (1-36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype at diagnosis had a significantly longer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase duration than those with chromosomal abnormalities (median of 20 months vs. 5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a short survival time after diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, whether chromosomal anomalies were present or not </plain></SENT>
