<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2008, The International Committee for Standardization in Hematology recommended the use of two types of slides for the microscopic evaluation of bone marrow: wedge-spread film and crush film slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because these techniques have not yet been compared, we performed such a comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Routine bone marrow samples from 250 patients diagnosed due to different neoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major differences between the two compared techniques were identified in 13 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, seven patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> and 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_501'>myelomonocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences were noted also in many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, but the clinical significance of these discrepancies was rather modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major causes of the differences observed seemed to be the dilution of marrow with blood cells and the focal growth of many neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe that the crush technique is more advantageous compared to the wedge-spread films </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we recommend the use of crush films as the primary method for establishing a diagnosis or for making therapeutic decisions based on the microscopic examination of bone marrow </plain></SENT>
