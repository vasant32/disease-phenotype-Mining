<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The development of techniques for sequencing the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq) enables it to study the biological mechanisms such as alternative splicing and gene expression regulation more deeply and accurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most existing methods employ <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq to quantify the expression levels of already annotated isoforms from the reference genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the current reference genome is very incomplete due to the complexity of the transcriptome which hiders the comprehensive investigation of transcriptome using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Novel study on isoform inference and estimation purely from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq without annotation information is desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A Nonnegativity and Sparsity constrained Maximum APosteriori (NSMAP) model has been proposed to estimate the expression levels of isoforms from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq data without the annotation information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous methods, NSMAP performs identification of the structures of expressed isoforms and estimation of the expression levels of those expressed isoforms simultaneously, which enables better identification of isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the simulations parameterized by two real <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq data sets, more than 77% expressed isoforms are correctly identified and quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then, we apply NSMAP on two <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq data sets of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) samples and one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sample in order to identify differentially expressed known and novel isoforms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NSMAP provides a good strategy to identify and quantify novel isoforms without the knowledge of annotated reference genome which can further realize the potential of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-Seq technique in transcriptome analysis </plain></SENT>
