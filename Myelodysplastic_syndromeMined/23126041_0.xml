<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mediastinal myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> is very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are two major types of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>: granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> and monoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, according to immature cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> is found in 2%-8% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> may develop before or concurrently with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, or may be the initial manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> relapse in previously treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blast transformation of some form of myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> may also manifest as myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A major differential diagnostic problem is isolated primary myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> without bone marrow and peripheral blood involvement, which may precede leukemic stage for months or years, and which is frequently misdiagnosed, mostly as malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A case is presented of a 56-year-old female patient complaining of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, dry cough and breathing difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination revealed enhanced vascular pattern on the right chest and right arm <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed an expansive growth measuring 11 cm craniocaudally in the anterior mediastinum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> cytology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass yielded a scarcely cellular sample with individual atypical immature cells, fine chromatin structure and scarce cytoplasm with occasional granules and Auer rods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Considering the morphological, cytochemical and immunocytochemical characteristics of immature cells, the diagnosis of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> was made and verified by histopathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Immature cells were not found by analysis of bone marrow puncture sample, immunophenotyping of bone marrow cells and bone biopsy analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As immature cell proliferation was not detected in bone marrow and peripheral blood, while spread of the disease beyond the mediastinum was ruled out by imaging methods (CT, ultrasonography), it was decided to be a primary non-leukemic form of mediastinal myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> should be taken in consideration on differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> because making an accurate diagnosis is necessary for timely initiation of appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Weakly expressed or lacking clear signs of myeloid differentiation may hamper morphological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As isolated myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> is a very rare entity frequently resembling <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in clinical presentation, it poses a major diagnostic challenge for both morphologists and clinicians </plain></SENT>
