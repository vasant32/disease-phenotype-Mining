<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relapsed cells from four out of five patients had a reduced ability to stimulate proliferation of lymphocytes from an HLA-mismatched responder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was decreased susceptibility to lysis by CTL in three and reduced susceptibility to NK-mediated lysis in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> had marked alterations in expression of critical surface molecules involved in immune responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three had decreased expression of MHC class I and II, with no change or increase in CD54 (ICAM-1) or CD80 (B7.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of these responded to treatment with donor lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed no change, or increased expression of MHC with no change or decrease in ICAM-1 or B7.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two achieved remission - one in response to donor lymphocytes and one following withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one patient transplanted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> in transformation, interferon-gamma upregulated expression of MHC molecules in relapsed cells and increased their stimulatory capacity and target susceptibility to unmatched responder lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that immune escape through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is a common occurrence in patients who relapse with myelogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> after BMT </plain></SENT>
