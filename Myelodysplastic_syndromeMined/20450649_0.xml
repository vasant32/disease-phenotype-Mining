<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 2001 to February 2009, 60 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> underwent allo-HSCT in our hospital were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimens were Myleran (BU)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) or Flu for identical sibling HSCT, and BU/Cy or Flu plus anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) for haploidentical and unrelated HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and short-course MTX were used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diseased free survival (DFS) was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total DFS rate was 75.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate was 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DFS rates in RA/<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>/5q-, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-I</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318551" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB-II</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) subgroups were 84.6%, 80.0%, 81.0%, 56.2%, respectively (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DFS rates in IPSS low risk group, intermediate-I risk group, intermediate-I risk group and high risk group were 80.0%, 84.6%, 81.8% and 65.4%, respectively (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DFS rates for allo-HSCT from identical sibling, unrelated or haploidentical donors were 79.2%, 60.0%, 76.9%, respectively (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DFS rates for percentages of blasts in bone marrow pre-transplant were 87.0%, 65.5%, 75.0% in &lt; 5% blasts, 5% - 20% blasts, &gt; 20% blasts subgroups, respectively (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since favorable clinical outcomes have been seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kinds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> by allo-HSCT, HSCT should be the first-line therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant differences are found based on different stem cell donors and the percentages of bone marrow blasts pre-HSCT, unrelated or haploidentical donors should be important alternatives if there is no identical sibling available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy before transplantation is not necessary except overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A larger clinical study is needed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of allo-HSCT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
