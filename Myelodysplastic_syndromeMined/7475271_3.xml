<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Constitutively 'activating' point mutations of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> have been detected at high frequency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">preleukaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, however, the distribution of expression of p21RAS in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or preleukaemic primary haematopoietic cells has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the expression of p21RAS and its negative regulator/downstream effector, p120GAP, in combination with lineage-specific cluster of differentiation markers in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and preleukaemic myeloid bone marrow cells using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> bone marrow was characterized by low and uniform levels of p21RAS expression throughout <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lineages analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 28% (9/32) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) over-expressed p21RAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three of these patients a single over-expressing peak of p21RAS expression was observed, with no evidence of a population exhibiting expression within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 6/32 MDS patients over-expression of p21RAS was observed only in a subpopulation of the myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up samples were analysed in three of these six patients; over-expression was confirmed in each patient and in two patients a relative expansion of the over-expressing cell population was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight out of nine of the patients with aberrant p21RAS expression were diagnosed with low-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From 21 MDS patients screened for p120GAP expression, no reduction or loss of expression was observed, however, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patient demonstrated a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>p120GAP expression was lower (P &lt; 0.05) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> group than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of the study suggest that over-expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> gene product, p21RAS, may represent an alternative or additional mechanism of activation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> signalling pathway and that this may play a role in leukaemogenesis, however, there is no evidence from this study that loss of p120GAP expression is a feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
