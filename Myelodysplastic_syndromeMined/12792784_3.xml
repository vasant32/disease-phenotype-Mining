<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these activities are mediated by direct binding of the p53 tetramer to specific target sequences in promoters of directed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lack of p53 function is often connected with development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, but the frequency of p53 mutations is low in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of mutations in the p53 gene in leukocytes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) using the FASAY functional analysis and to assess the relationship between the presence of p53 mutation and disease outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following observations were made: i) the presence of p53 mutations was detected in 13 of 62 tested <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases (21%) and in 1 of 4 tested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) cases by FASAY; ii) the presence of p53 mutation was shown to be a poor prognostic/predictive factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (p=0.03/0.002); iii) although there is a statistically significant relationship between the presence of p53 mutation and p53 protein accumulation (p=0.05), not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples having p53 mutation exhibited p53 protein accumulation; iv) five of 13 p53 mutations detected in the leukocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (38.5%) and the mutation detected in the leukocytes of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patient (altogether 6/14-42.9%) were partially inactivating ts mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of the ts p53 mutations in our study; and a novel modification in performing FASAY, are discussed; v) different ts mutations differ in the level of their temperature sensitivity and in their responsiveness to the cytoprotective drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
