<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We surveyed DNAs from patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> by Southern blot hybridization to analyze bcr rearrangements, and detected a new restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the breakpoint cluster region at a BamHI site in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using a 1.2-kb HindIII-BglII 3' bcr probe, unusual BamHI restriction enzyme fragments (1.9 kb and 1.4 kb) were detected from the DNAs of three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNAs from cultured fibroblasts derived from the skin of a patient, as well as from peripheral leukocytes of the father of a patient and the mother of another patient, showed identical 1.9- and 1.4-kb additional bands, besides a 3.3-kb germline band, establishing that polymorphism, rather than gene arrangement, was responsible for these additional restriction enzyme fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, RFLP was not detected in the DNAs of 40 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> unrelated individuals </plain></SENT>
