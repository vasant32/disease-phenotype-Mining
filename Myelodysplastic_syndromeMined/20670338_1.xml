<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) are often polymorphic and nonspecific including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Standard parameters provided by an automated analyzer seldom bring any argument for this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether some structural parameters, not routinely provided by Sysmex™ XE 2100 analyzer, could help diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in a simple way, adapted to routine practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples from 184 MDS fully annotated cases and 3545 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood count controls were performed with XE 2100 Sysmex™ analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative and structural parameters were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the structural neutrophil parameter, NEUT-X, converted into a semi-quantitative parameter, the granularity index (GI), could be used as a flag for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in front of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Negative GI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> were able to make otherwise unrecognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> stand out in routine practice, increasing the number of slides addressed to review from 67% to 96%, without leading to a large excess of unfounded slide review among non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Including the GI index in the routine parameters provided by the Sysmex analyzer could be of major help for nonspecialized routine laboratories in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
