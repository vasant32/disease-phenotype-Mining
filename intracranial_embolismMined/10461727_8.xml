<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A prior study has reported that a rapid recanalization therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, using liquid jet impacts generated by the interaction of gas bubbles with shock waves, can potentially penetrate through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in as little as a few microseconds with very efficient ablation (Kodama et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1997) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to examine the liquid jet impact effect on fibrinolysis in a tube model of an internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, the conditions for generating the maximum penetration depth of liquid jets in the tube were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gelatin was used to mimic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The shock wave was generated by detonating a silver <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40910">azide</z:chebi> pellet weighing about a few micrograms located in a balloon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The collapse of the inserted gas bubbles and the subsequent liquid jet formation were recorded with high-speed photography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Second, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were formed using fresh human blood from healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fibrinolysis induced by the liquid jet impact with urokinase was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was conducted under selected conditions based on the experiment using the gelatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolysis was calculated as the percentage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolysis with urokinase alone and with a single liquid jet impact with urokinase was 1.9 +/- 3.7% (n = 16) and 20.0 +/- 9.0% (n = 35), respectively, for an incubation time of 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Statistical differences were obtained between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that liquid jet impact thrombolysis has the potential to be a rapid and effective therapeutic modality in recanalization therapy for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and other clinical conditions of intra-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
