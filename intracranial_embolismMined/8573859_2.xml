<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The duration of support ranged from 46 to 390 days (mean, 206 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, stable hemodynamics were achieved with 3.5-5.5 L/min flow rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients survived long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One was transported to the United States by a chartered jet while on LVAS and successfully underwent heart transplantation after 119 days of support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other is on LVAS and is doing well for 390 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining two patients died of multi-organ failure while their hemodynamics were quite stable under LVAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these two patients, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> had developed before LVAS implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> occurred in the two survivors, but neither of them experienced permanent neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In only the initial patient were major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> noted on the diaphragm of the pump; the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> required pump exchange four times during 119 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the patient supported for 390 days, a small tear in the diaphragm was observed after 209 days of support, and the pump was safely exchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the Toyobo LVAS can provide consistent and reliable performance for long-term use </plain></SENT>
