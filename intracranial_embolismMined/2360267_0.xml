<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In seven cases, the neurological deficits were of thromboembolic origin and in further seven cases the deficits occurred in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cases were classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>-equivalents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining eleven cases it was not possible to decide whether the persisting neurological deficits were of migrainous or thromboembolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine of these 11 patients were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and six had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> or photo/phonofobia </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>Migraine</z:hpo>-aura was most probably the cause of the persisting deficits in some of these 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>-aura is relatively often the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in young adults </plain></SENT>
