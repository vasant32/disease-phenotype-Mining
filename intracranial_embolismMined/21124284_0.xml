<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Despite distal embolic protection (DEP) during carotid artery stenting (CAS), there is still an appreciable risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially in symptomatic patients and octogenerians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of embolic events is possibly related to microembolization of debris remaining on or forming on stent struts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the safety of using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between August 2006 and July 2010, 80 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with severe carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (&gt;80%) underwent CAS utilizing DEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After completion of CAS and before removal of DEP, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> catheter was passed through the CAS segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both extracted volume and the DEP were visually examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients were divided into two groups, Group 1 (N=7) comprised those who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy to treat no-flow or an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic change that occurred during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group 2 (N=73) comprised patients that underwent prophylactic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were then compared to a control group (N=925) who had CAS with DEP, but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate to large amounts of debris were extracted from the CAS segment in the majority of thrombectomy patients (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1%) and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1%) in the thrombectomy groups, while the control group had 3.0% rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P=0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo> thrombectomy recovers large to moderate amounts of debris and is safe and does not increase adverse periprocedural events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A large scale, randomized trial with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed to further investigate our findings </plain></SENT>
