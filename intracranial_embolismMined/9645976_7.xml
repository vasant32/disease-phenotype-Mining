<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we compared risk factor profiles as indicators of underlying vessel pathology, between patients with SDI and patients with PICH, and those with a non-cardio-embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> involving the cortex (CORTI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis showed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> [odds ratio (OR) 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.90] and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.40-0.99) were more strongly associated with CORTI than with SDI </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with PICH, CORTI was more strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR 3.27; 95% CI 1.38-7.76), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (OR 24.42; 95% CI 4.99-119.45), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> (OR 3.12; 95% CI 1.47-6.65), whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was associated with PICH (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18-0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data support the hypothesis that small-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> rather than small-vessel lipohyalinosis underlies lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in most cases </plain></SENT>
