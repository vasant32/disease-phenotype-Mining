<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and combined stent-grafting (SG) were evaluated to reduce morbidity and mortality of patients with descending or infrarenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CABG and SG (thoracic n=6, infrarenal n=36) were performed during the same hospitalization in 42 patients (mean age of 73+/-14 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 29 patients (mean Euroscore: 9), SG was performed under local anesthesia 9+/-3 days after coronary surgery (simultaneous) and in 13 patients (mean Euroscore: 7) during the same anesthesia (synchronous) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the latter group, 11 out of 13 patients underwent off-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated by implantation of commercially available self-expanding grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CABG was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, but one patient with left internal mammary artery hypoperfusion syndrome, requiring an additional distal saphenous graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SG was uneventful in 98% (41/42 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative computerized tomography showed incomplete sealing in seven patients (17%), but only the two attachment endoleaks had to be treated by one proximal and one distal SG extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall hospital stay for the synchronous repair was 12.5+/-6 days and that of the simultaneous group 17.5+/-7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality was 5% (2/42) as one patient of the simultaneous group experienced a lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during SG and one patient of the synchronous group developed an untreatable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up of 4 years, there were two vascular reinterventions but no additional procedure-related morbidity or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This experience shows that combined CABG and SG of thoracic or infrarenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> is a safe and less-invasive alternative to the open graft repair, especially in the older patients or patients with severe comorbidities </plain></SENT>
