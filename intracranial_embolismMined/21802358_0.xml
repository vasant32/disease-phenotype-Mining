<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a swine model of CAGE to determine if quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) is a useful tool in diagnosis and prognostication of CAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 0.05 ml/kg of air was injected into the ascending pharyngeal artery in 16 pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> in brain microdialysate and brain oxygen tension were measured during 4h after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The qEEG parameters mean amplitude (MAMP), alpha-delta ratio (ADR), spectral edge frequency (SEF(90)), spatial brain symmetry index (sBSI) and temporal brain symmetry index (tBSI) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MAMP and tBSI but not ADR, SEF(90) and sBSI correlate with intracranial pressure, brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and brain oxygen tension after 4h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early levels of MAMP and tBSI can predict intracranial pressure, brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and brain oxygen tension after 4h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MAMP and tBSI are sensitive for cerebral injury and can predict outcome in a swine model of CAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides evidence for the utility of qEEG for diagnosis and prognosis in CAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to investigate the use of this method in patients </plain></SENT>
