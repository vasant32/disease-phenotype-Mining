<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of inability of these patients to express <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, the diagnosis of PPU was suspected only in the presence of the frequently associated clinical signs such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002789'>tachypnea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the diagnosis of PPU in these patients is generally delayed, mortality up to 60% is noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of PPU was made by chest X-ray with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> in only 5 of the 10 patients, whereas that of the remaining 5 patients was made by peritoneal lavage with bile-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is a good correlation between the presence of shock after PPU and the survival of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recommend that once there are abnormal abdominal signs, inexplicable hemodynamic changes in patients with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system injury, immediate thorough examination in search of PPU should be made to detect early the life-threatening PPU and to reduce the mortality thereafter </plain></SENT>
