<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were caused by emboli of mucin and emulsified fat, originating in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Attention is drawn to this process because emboli of this type have never been reported and because this distant nonmetastatic effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> may have been overlooked in other cases </plain></SENT>
