<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we aimed to evaluate global cognitive function (Mini Mental State Exam MMSE) in relation to both cardiac function (evaluated by echocardiogram) and cerebrovascular hemodynamics (evaluated by transcranial Doppler TCD) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 83 patients studied, no correlation was found between echocardiographic parameters and MMSE scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a significant correlation was found between right middle cerebral artery (RMCA) mean flow velocity and MMSE score (r=0.231 p=0.039), as well as between RMCA pulsatility index and MMSE score (rs= -0.292 p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After excluding patients with a previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, only RMCA pulsatility index correlated with MMSE score (rs=-0,314 p=0,007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between high cerebrovascular resistance and worse cognitive scores suggest that microembolism may be responsible for a significant proportion of cognitive symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
