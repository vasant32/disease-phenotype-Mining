<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, differences between mechanical reperfusion versus clot thrombolysis may influence reperfusion injury profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we compared blood flow recovery, blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression in cortex after mechanical versus thrombolytic reperfusion in rat focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male spontaneously hypertensive rats were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mechanical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion was achieved with the use of an intraluminal filament to occlude the middle cerebral artery for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic reperfusion was achieved by administering tissue plasminogen activator at 2 hours after embolic focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional cortical blood flow was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability in cortex was measured by Evans blue dye leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cortical MMP-9 levels were assessed with zymography and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood flow recovery during mechanical reperfusion was complete in both central and peripheral areas of ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, after thrombolysis, reperfusion was incomplete, with moderate recovery in the periphery only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was mainly increased in the central regions of the ischemic cortex after mechanical reperfusion but was increased in both central and peripheral areas after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, MMP-9 levels were higher after embolic versus mechanical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, even though ischemic injury was similar in both models at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the profiles of blood flow recovery, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage, and MMP-9 upregulation in mechanical versus thrombolytic reperfusion after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
