<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated angiographically occlusion or stenosis of draining veins in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 51 cases who were diagnosed as cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> by angiography in our hospital between April 1973 and January 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those consisted of 8 dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>, 3 mixed pial-dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>, and 40 pial <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography was stereoscopically done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiograms obtained prior to treatment were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases of dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> or arteriovenous fistulae in the cavernous sinus were excluded from the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of 51 cases (16%) had occlusion or stenosis of draining veins; i.e., 2 dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>, 1 mixed pial-dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, 5 pial <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of 2 dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> was located in the sigmoid sinus, and another involved the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One mixed pial-dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was a vein of Galen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Occlusion or stenosis was recognized at the junction of the vein of Galen to the straight sinus (3 cases), in the straight sinus (2 cases), at the junction of the vein of Labbe to the transverse sinus (1 case), in the superior sagittal sinus (1 case), and in the sigmoid sinus (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of 8 cases with occlusion or stenosis of draining vein presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> at the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In cases of pial <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>, occlusion or stenosis of draining vein seemed be related to endothelial changes due to turbulent and irregular flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in cases of dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> with dural sinus occlusion, sinus abnormalities may precede the formation of fistulous communications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
