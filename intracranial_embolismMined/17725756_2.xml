<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are extensive and have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we evaluated the cardiovascular status with special reference to persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF) combined with the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We divided 315 consecutive patients admitted to our Department of Neurosurgery with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> into four types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> using clinical history, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and brain imaging: cardioembolic (group E, n = 105), lacunar (group L, n = 92), atherothrombotic (group T, n = 111), and unclassified (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent standard electrocardiography (ECG), a 24-hour ECG recording (Holter ECG) and transthoracic echocardiography (UCG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Persistent AF or PAF was detected in 97 patients (31.5%) using Holter ECG: more frequently in group E (67.6%) than in groups L (15.2%) or T (9.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Persistent AF or PAF was first diagnosed on admission using a standard ECG in 16 patients (5.2%) with no previous history and 14 of these patients belonged to group E (13.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PAF was newly detected on Holter ECG in another 26 patients (8.4%) and 13 of these patients (12.4%) belonged to group E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concerning UCG, left atrial enlargement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> were more frequent in group E than in group L or T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Holter ECG in addition to ECG on admission is important for detecting persistent AF or PAF in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, especially with cardioembolism as diagnosed by neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
