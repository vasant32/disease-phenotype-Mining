<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The main advantage of bioprostheses, avoidance of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, is compromised during the early postoperative period; in fact, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> is often administered during the first 3 postoperative months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 250 patients undergoing tissue aortic valve replacement between January 2002 and December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients received either aspirin (group 1) or oral anticoagulation (group 2) during the first 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of these patients, we investigated the possible presence of clinically silent microembolization by means of transcranial Doppler for microembolic signal detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No major neurologic events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were observed in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up time was 24 +/- 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall late mortality rate was 0.8% in group 1 versus 12% (mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> related) in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group 2, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were due to major ischemic neurologic events; overall, 3 major neurologic episodes occurred (international normalized ratio was within therapeutic range) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no neurologic events in group 1 (P = .12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-free survival did not reach statistical significance between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler was performed after a mean interval of 55 +/- 19 days, with no detection of microembolic signals in patients receiving either aspirin or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or neurologic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin therapy appears to be the appropriate response to both cardiac surgeons' and patients' needs in the early postoperative course after aortic valve replacement with tissue valves, demonstrating adequate antithromboembolic efficacy with no added risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> as well as ease of administration </plain></SENT>
