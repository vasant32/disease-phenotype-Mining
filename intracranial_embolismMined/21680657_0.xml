<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic events</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> coiling are common, but the optimal algorithm for emboli prevention remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MESs correlate with the occurrence of impending ischemic events and may be used for management guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study reports the use of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> monitoring with regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> characteristics and coiling technique after a specific anticoagulation protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 123 consecutive, elective endovascular procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received intraprocedural and continuous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> if feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size, type of intervention/complication, medication, imaging, and clinical outcome were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> monitoring was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients both immediately after as well as &gt;12 hours after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Heparinization within the first 12 hours was associated with lower numbers of MESs early after coiling (3.4 versus 18.8 MESs/hr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size, stent-assisted procedures, or incomplete occlusion did not lead to a significant increase in MESs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If the initial <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> count on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was &gt;10 MESs/hr, it was always safe to discontinue <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inability to initiate early, continuous heparinization was associated with new neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional administration of antiplatelet agents showed lower <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts initially, but the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> monitoring is a powerful adjunct to monitor efficacy of treatment algorithms for emboli prevention after coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our series, early heparinization was associated with a lower incidence of MESs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is of particular importance in larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, stent-assisted procedures, and incomplete occlusions, in which the thromboembolic risk is greatest early on and antiplatelet treatment alone may not suffice </plain></SENT>
