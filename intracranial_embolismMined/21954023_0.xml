<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Registry data and the PARTNER trial have shown a significant risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (3-5%) following the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies using cerebral Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) have suggested the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to be multiple small embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, possibly from aortic atheroma dislodged during the movement of the valve and its apparatus around the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is higher than clinically apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Medtronic CoreValve (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota) prosthesis is a self-expanding nitinol frame with porcine valve, whose deployment is achieved by the retraction of the delivery catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential complications of this method include valve mal-positioning and dislocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The partially deployed valve may then be resheathed following retraction back into the descending aorta and subsequently redeployed </plain></SENT>
