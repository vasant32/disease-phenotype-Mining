<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> has been found in 100% of BIH and 28.5% of CVT, visual acuity loss in 52% of BIH and 6% of CVT, obnubilation in 0% of BIH and 65% of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid, EEG, cerebral angiography and Scanner were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of BIH, while in CVT the same investigations were abnormal in respectively 90%, 100%, 100% and 54% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was excellent in BIH with only one residual mild loss of visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrences occurred in 18% of BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among CVT 18% died, 23% developed neurological sequelae, 59% totally recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this comparative study we emphasize the following points: 6% of CVT only follow a course of BIH from end to end, according to Johnston and Paterson's diagnostic criteria of BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cases concern only <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of lateral sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other cases of CVT rather deal with patients admitted in neurosurgical units on emergency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of CVT is a difficult one and prognosis is still serious in spite of the use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>85% of BIH are irrelevant to CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BIH is a "quiet" intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> without trouble of vigilance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prognosis is really good if diagnosis is early made, in spite of possible multiple recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treatment consists of CSF subtraction, preferably through external lumbar drainage, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> prescription </plain></SENT>
