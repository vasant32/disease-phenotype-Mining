<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Beam-hardening artifacts in CTA can be greatly reduced by using metal-free coils for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the embolic masses and remnants of experimental rabbit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> coiled with hydrogel filaments by using DSA, CTA and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Embolization of 12 rabbit bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was performed with detachable hydrogel filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were embolized as completely as possible, and 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were embolized incompletely to intentionally leave remnants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in each group underwent follow-up at 4 and 13 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DSA, MRA, and CTA were performed immediately before sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The harvested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were evaluated histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For each imaging technique, the areas of the embolic mass and remnant were determined by using image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were compared by using paired t tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CTAs were suitable for quantification of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and remnant areas because only small streaking artifacts were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The areas of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> were larger on CTA compared with DSA and histologic sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The areas of the remnant were larger on CTA and MRA compared with DSA and histologic sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Like DSA and MRA, CTA was suitable for determining whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> retreatment was necessary, provided that loops of hydrogel filaments were not present in the parent artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that CTA is a technique with potential for surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with hydrogel filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additional work is required to determine the accuracy of the technique compared with currently accepted imaging modalities of DSA and MRA </plain></SENT>
