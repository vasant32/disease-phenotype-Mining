<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative monitoring of blood flow in artery ophthalmic vas carried out with 60% of patients, in the middle cerebral artery-with 40% during the main stages of CEA, and with 64 patients in the middle cerebral artery during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The comparison of the data of intraoperative monitoring of blood flow in middle cerebral artery with the result of brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) 24 hours after the operation shows, that solid microembolic signals and vasospasm are prognostic signals (sensibility and specifics make up 95%) in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The monitoring of blood flow in artery ophthalmic is of the greatest diagnostic value in estimation of the hemodynamic situation, but it is of the lowest practical value in detecting microembolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the data of the intraoperative blood flow monitoring in middle cerebral artery in group CEA the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> were predicted with 11,1% of patients and the cause of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, developed by 2,9% of the patients, was specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the result of DW-MRI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> were diagnosed with 21% of patients, that is, 18% of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group CAS ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> were prognosed with 30% of patients, actually they were later detected with 40,6% of cases by means of DW-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the data of intraoperative of blood flow monitoring the cause of the development of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was specified in 6,2% of cause; in 34,4% of cause the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
