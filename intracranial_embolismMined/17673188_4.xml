<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNFalpha) is involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> following large clot embolism-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in New Zealand white rabbits by intracisternally administering either TNFalpha or a goat-anti-rabbit-TNFalpha antibody following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first aim of the study showed that TNFalpha administration increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> incidence to 53.3% from 18.5% (an increase of 188%) in the control group and also increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volume by 87% (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second aim showed that administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) using a standard dose of 3.3 mg/kg increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> incidence in rabbits to 76.5% from 18.5% (an increase of 314%) and this effect was reversed by administration of an anti-TNFalpha antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the tPA-anti-TNFalpha antibody group, the absolute <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate was 38.8% and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volume was 98% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, following an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, TNFalpha administration increased the incidence and volume of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and an anti-TNFalpha antibody counteracted tPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that TNFalpha may either be directly or indirectly involved in vascular damage following an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, TNFalpha may mediate some of the detrimental effects of tPA on the vascular compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based upon our studies, TNFalpha receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> or TNFalpha processing inhibitors should be further pursued as targets for the treatment of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as adjuvant treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients receiving thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
