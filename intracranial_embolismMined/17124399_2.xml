<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound detection of weak embolic signals is inhibited by intrinsic limitations within the human auditory system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Psychoacoustics effects are likely to be exacerbated in a clinical environment, where automated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection has potential to surpass manual detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we quantify the impact of clinical environment on manual detection of Doppler embolic signals following carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also discuss the implications of psychoacoustics considerations for the evaluation of automated detection systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Concurrent monitoring by vascular technologists and an automated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection system were performed for 50 consecutive patients during postoperative recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both detection methods were evaluated against a majority decision human expert panel analyzing under ideal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical environment reduced the overall sensitivity of manual monitoring by approximately 23%, mainly due to a approximately 2-dB increase in the lower threshold for detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical environment was also associated with a reduction in positive predictive value for manual detection of approximately 9% compared to ideal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Automated monitoring, which is not affected by environment, was marginally more sensitive for detection of weaker embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One in 4 weak embolic signals was missed during routine clinical monitoring compared to ideal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Automated detection (in this study) performed slightly better than human observers but did not approach the performance of the majority decision panel </plain></SENT>
