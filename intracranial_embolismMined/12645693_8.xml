<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As waiting periods for heart transplantation have lengthened, the application of long-term mechanical circulatory support (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>) has become more common in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anticipating increased long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>, a policy to discharge patients home has been instituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compares the results of outpatient on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> to a group of patients remaining hospitalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report our 10-year experience with 108 patients on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>, who were supported for more than 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group A consisted of 38 patients (25 Novacor, 13 Berlin Heart) who underwent assist implantation from 1996 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had a mean support time of 454 days (range 100 to 1074 days) and spent a mean of 326 days (range 20 to 769 days) at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group B consisted of 70 patients (24 Novacor, 46 Berlin Heart) who underwent assist implantation between 1991 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They had a mean support time of 234 days (range 95 to 795 days) and were not discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients were monitored for complications, hospital readmissions, and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and thromboembolic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group A total mortality was 16% (6/38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, one from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, two from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic infection</z:e>, and one from multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients (84%) required 95 readmissions to the hospital due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (n = 9), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (n = 1), wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (n = 23), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorder</z:e> (n = 13) for heart transplantation (n = 5), and (n = 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In group B the mortality was 43% (30/70) for noncardiac reasons and thus significant higher (p = 0.004, chi2 test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (n = 5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n = 7), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic infection</z:e> (n = 14, significantly higher, p = 0.04, chi2 test), and multiorgan failure (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> can be used in outpatients without increased mortality and with an acceptable rate of readmissions (2.8/patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It ensures the survival of the patient, enables recovery from multiorgan failure, and offers an acceptable quality of life </plain></SENT>
