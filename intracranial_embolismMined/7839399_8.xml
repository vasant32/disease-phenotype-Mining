<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The combined use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin appears to reduce the risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> at a low risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The remaining incidence of embolism of approximately 2%/y is still high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods for real-time detection of embolic events have not been used thus far to monitor the efficacy of therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They might permit individually tailored, effective treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The frequency of embolic signals in both middle cerebral arteries was monitored using a two-channel 2-MHz transcranial Doppler system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined five patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves suffering from recurrent cerebral ischemic symptoms despite adequate <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy (international normalized ratio, 3.0 to 4.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements were performed on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> alone (four baseline values) and subsequent to the addition of intravenous (500 mg bolus) and oral (100 mg/d for 10 days) aspirin or intravenous (5000 IU bolus) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prothrombotic markers thrombin-antithrombin III complex, fibrinopeptide A, D-dimer, and platelet beta-thromboglobulin were measured simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the combined drug regimens led to a significant reduction of the emboli count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The values of thrombin-antithrombin III complex, fibrinopeptide A, and D-dimer were already within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The beta-thromboglobulin levels, however, were increased, and additional aspirin or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> did not reduce them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the emboli count and the prothrombotic markers or between the prothrombotic markers and the different drug regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> measured with transcranial Doppler in the group of high-risk patients studied was not influenced by additional antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The emboli are likely to be composed at least in part of platelets, and their generation seems not dependent on thrombin or cyclooxygenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is an apparent discrepancy between the unchanged rate of emboli during Doppler monitoring found in this and other studies and the partial efficacy of combined treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> and aspirin in clinical long-term studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This may be explained by differences in the composition or size of the emboli </plain></SENT>
