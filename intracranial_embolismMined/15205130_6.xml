<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical cerebral-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> shows both reversible and irreversible changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging to investigate the reversibility of embolized lesions induced with a fat-emulsion technique and to evaluate the histologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A fat emulsion was made with 0.05 mL of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> and 20 mL of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline and vigorous to-and-fro movement through a three-way stopcock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 50 cats, the internal carotid artery was infused with the fat emulsion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cats were divided into six groups on the basis of time delay after embolization: 1 hour; 1 and 4 days; and 1, 2, and 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and histologic examination were performed at these times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Embolized lesions were hyperintense on T2-weighted images, isointense or mildly hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images, isointense on apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and enhancing on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced T1-weighted images at 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings were less evident at day 1 and reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after day 4 (isointense on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> images) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed minimal findings in the cortical lesion in groups 1 and 2 (group 1 at 1 hour and group 2 at 1 hour and 1 day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Light microscopic findings revealed evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>-small focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> in the periventricular white matter-in only one cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of intravascular fat globules was not significantly different between groups, as visualized by oil red O staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> induced by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> emulsion revealed reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings and minimal histologic findings </plain></SENT>
