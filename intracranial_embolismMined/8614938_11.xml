<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The pathophysiology of sinus-vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) in patients and experimental animals is still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine and further elucidate the pathophysiological sequence of events, especially the relationship between local and regional blood flow and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> oxygen saturation (HbSO2) detected at identical locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of both parameters as outcome indicators should be compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> was induced by ligation of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and slow injection of kaolin-cephalin suspension into the SSS in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was assessed by laser-Doppler flowmetry together with regional HbSO2, which was measured by a microspectrophotometric technique at 48 identical locations for 90 minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> using a scanning technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence angiography was performed before and 30 and 90 minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 48 hours the animals were killed for histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The fluorescence angiographic findings could divide animals into three groups: (1) group A, with a solitary SSS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (n=8); (2) group B, with a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of SSS and cortical veins (n=10); (3) group C, animals that had undergone sham operation (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreases of rCBF and HbSO2 and brain damage were seen in group B but not in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduction of local HbSO2 preceded the flow decrease after sagittal sinus ligation but before <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure in group A was found to be significantly higher after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> than in groups B and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The brain with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> extension of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> from the SSS into cortical veins experiences a critically reduced supply of blood and oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CBF, local HbSO2, and repeated angiography can be helpful monitors for the early detection of critical conditions after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Local HbSO2 has a greater sensitivity to predict outcome than lCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, therapies directed to improve perfusion pressure or reduce vascular resistance may open further therapeutic windows during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
