<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of white blood cells (WBCs) on the red blood cell (RBC)-filterability, and the influence of plasma components on their interaction of their microcirculatory behaviour in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects studied were 20 patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (60 +/- 4.7 years old) (mean +/- SD) and 28 healthy controls (59 +/- 5.4 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Filterability indices of RBC suspension (RFI) and suspension with RBCs plus WBCs (RWFI) were measured by the method of Nuclepore filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The values of RFI in patients and controls were 0.44 +/- 0.12 and 0.56 +/- 0.16 ml min-1 (mean +/- SD), and RWFIs were 0.33 +/- 0.092 and 0.40 +/- 0.11 ml min-1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The differences in both of these values between patients and controls were significant (p &lt; or = 0.01 for RFI and p &lt; or = 0.05 for RWFI, based on Student's t test, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both RFI and RWFI in bed-ridden patients were lower than those in the more active counterparts (p &lt; or = 0.05, based on Student's t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients, RFI and RWFI correlated positively with serum albumin (r = +0.515, p &lt; 0.05; r = +0.533, p &lt; 0.05, based on Student's t test, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The net lowering effect of WBCs on RFI (RFI-RWFI) correlated positively with serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> in patients (r = +0.574, p &lt; 0.01, based on Student's t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WBCs play a significant role in reducing RFI, and its effect is related to the pathemas of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
