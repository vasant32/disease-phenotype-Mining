<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repeat CABS is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) in saphenous or internal mammary bypass grafts or native coronary arteries in 23 patients after CABS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We successfully dilated 35 of 37 lesions (95%) present in 33 of 35 vessels (94%) of 21 of 23 patients (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean vessel narrowing decreased from 86 +/- 22% to 13 +/- 19% (p less than 0.001) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 patients with angiographic evidence of success functional capacity improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single vein grafts were successfully dilated in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or needed emergency surgery, but 1 had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PTCA is effective therapy for recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> after CABS, and in many patients is preferable to another operation </plain></SENT>
