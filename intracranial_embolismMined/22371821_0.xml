<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One example of this would be the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> often reflecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, frequently from a cardiac source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Posterior reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome (PRES) describes a usually reversible neurologic syndrome with a variety of presenting symptoms from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, diminished spontaneity and speech, abnormalities of visual perception and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a patient presenting with elevated blood pressure, CT characteristics of PRES but a highly circumscribed neurologic syndrome (Wernicke's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>Aphasia</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>) suggestive of a cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> affecting the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>That is, PRES mimicked a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The importance of recognizing this possibility is that his deficits resolved with blood pressure control, while other treatments, such as intensifying his anticoagulation would have been inappropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, allowing his blood pressure to remain elevated as is often done in the setting of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> might have perpetuated the underlying pathophysiology of PRES leading to a worse clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For this reason PRES needs to be recognized quickly and treated appropriately </plain></SENT>
