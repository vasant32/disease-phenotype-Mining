<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications of lymphography are extremely rare but may be life-threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Speculations as to the mechanisms which may be responsible for these complications, through a modification of the usual distribution of the contrast media, include lymphovenous shunts, lymphatic vessel compression or obstruction, pulmonary arteriovenous shunts and right-to-left intracardiac shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These mechanisms may facilitate cerebral embolization of the contrast media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indications of lymphography must be restricted in patients with patent lymphatic obstruction </plain></SENT>
