<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or Evans blue was given immediately following a 2-min photochemical sensitization period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 5 min following irradiation, multifocal sites of peroxidase extravasation were noted within the irradiated area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural examination revealed endothelial cells filled with HRP which in some cases extended into the basal lamina and extracellular spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 15 min, protein leakage was more pronounced within the irradiated zone and reaction product was also apparent within the subarachnoid and perivascular spaces of brain regions remote from the site of irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Widespread staining on the surface of the irradiated hemisphere was apparent in rats perfused 8 h following Evans blue infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Water content increased significantly by 15 min within the irradiated zone but not in brain regions remote from this site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is an early event in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, increases in water content are restricted to the irreversibly damaged site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, protein tracer escaping from microvessels coursing within the irradiated zone was widely distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings implicate endothelial barrier dysfunction in the genesis of tissue injury in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Morphological evidence for the capability of macromolecules to escape from a site of evolving infarction and to migrate to distances remote from the area of primary microvascular damage is also discussed </plain></SENT>
