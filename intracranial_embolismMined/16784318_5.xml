<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate whether filter-protected carotid artery stenting (CAS) using a covered self-expanding stent reduces the risk of cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen asymptomatic patients (13 men; median age 77 years, IQR 73-83) were enrolled in a randomized pilot trial comparing the rates of cerebral microembolism during and after filter-protected CAS using either a self-expanding covered (n=8) or a bare (n=6) carotid stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring was done during and for 90 minutes after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) was performed before and 24 hours after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for 6 months for neurological events and occurrence of restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant reduction in ipsilateral microembolic signals by TCD was observed with the covered (median 1, IQR 0-4) versus the bare stent (median 6, IQR 3-8; p=0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the preprocedural and 24-hour postprocedural DW-MRI images showed no new ipsilateral lesions but 1 new lesion in the contralateral hemisphere in the covered stent group, resulting in an overall 7% (95% CI 0%-20%) rate of new ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No neurological complications occurred up to 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restenosis (&gt;70%) occurred in 3 (38%) of 8 patients with the covered versus none of the bare stents (p=0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The trial was stopped when the third restenosis of a covered stent was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Self-expanding covered stents potentially reduce the risk of cerebral microembolism during and after carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the problem of in-stent restenosis has to be resolved before these devices can be considered for further investigation </plain></SENT>
