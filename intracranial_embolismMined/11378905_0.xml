<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">encephalomalacia</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> are usually caused by transient or permanent obstruction of the brain arteries lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beside local dysfunction of vessels the obstructions could be based on embolic events originating in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such an obstructions are resulting in global and focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemias</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Arterial occlusion</z:mp> results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> and the lack of oxygen (<z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp>) which leads to reversible or irreversible injury of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> cells in the ischaemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The local cell injury or cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> causes attraction of macrophages invading into the devitalized tissue within 72-96 hours after the beginning of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to find out the correlation between asymptomatic or symptomatic course regarding localisation of the ischaemic lesions in the cerebral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our anatomical findings were collected from 318 autopsies, and reports on postmortem examinations during the period between September-December 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The grossing of the brain was carried out by using of Virchow's method </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of those patients with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> had 87.5%, 44.3% were suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and 25% from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> analysed in this study originated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> or thromboembolic obstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We divided the lesions into 3 groups according to their size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most frequently apparent lesions (72%) were the small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> (0-10 mm in diameter)-lacunae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The majority of them (90%) was found in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The second group consisted of postmalatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_468'>pseudocysts</z:mpath> (10-30 mm in diameter), and the third group was represented by encephalomalatic lesions which were larger than 30 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cerebral ischaemic lesions were present in 27.8% of the studied cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, more than the half (56.8%) of the affected brains (postmalatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_468'>pseudocysts</z:mpath>, lacunae and malaciae) belongs to the group of patients who were clinically asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The asymptomatic lesions, having negative results in the patient's history, and the clinical course were localised mainly in the basal ganglia of both sides and in the frontal part of the right (nondominant) hemisphere </plain></SENT>
