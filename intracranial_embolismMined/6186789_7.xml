<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No satisfactory management of this condition is known; in addition, the early diagnosis of severe lesions of the "intradural vertebrobasilar artery" on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms alone is difficult and regularly requires invasive procedures </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two cases, in whom bilateral intracranial vertebral artery lesions and basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were successfully treated with the help of local intraarterial fibrinolysis, Doppler sonography proved to be a reliable diagnostic tool for the evaluation and the non-invasive follow-up of thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
