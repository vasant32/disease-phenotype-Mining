<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined with cerebral angiography and computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stenotic lesions in major cranial arteries were analyzed by measuring the apparent diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe stenosis was defined as 75 per cent constriction or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enhanced aggregation of platelets (secondary aggregation at 1 microM <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> or less) was present in 5 of 25 patients (20%) who had severe vessel stenosis or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT examination frequently revealed both cortical and deep involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 13 of 23 patients (57%) with less stenotic lesions showed enhanced aggregation and that was statistically significant (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many patients of this group had persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and small deep infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was also measured in 20 hypertensive control subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of them (20%) showed enhanced aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a combination of enhanced platelet aggregation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> increases the risk of small deep infarctions accompanied by mild stenotic changes of the major cranial arteries </plain></SENT>
