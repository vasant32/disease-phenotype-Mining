<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A detailed description is given of a new model of reversible focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A spherical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, attached to the end of an 8-0 surgical thread was injected into the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) via the external and internal carotid arteries (ECA and ICA) and could be withdrawn by pulling the extravascular portion of the thread when reperfusion was to follow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to similar techniques, the 8-0 thread did not block blood flow in either the common carotid artery (CCA) or the ICA during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and, as the CCA did not have to be ligated, flow could be restored via the ipsilateral CCA and ICA after the ischaemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit, mortality rate, tissue water content, regional pH, ATP and, in some experiments, electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were evaluated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and after various length of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate was 21%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these animals were lost in the first hours of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The water content of their brains differed significantly from those who survived 24 hours (81 and 77% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in CBF of the ipsi- and contralateral putamen was found immediately after embolization (a CBF decrease of 26 +/- 5 and 5 +/- 5 ml/100 g/min, respectively), and relative hyperperfusion (+23 +/- 27 ml/100 g/min) was observed in the ipsilateral putamen during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EEG amplitude declined on both the affected and non-affected sides after embolization (to 54 +/- 8% and 71 +/- 6% of pre-ischaemic values) and remained decreased (66 +/- 8% of control) on the ipsilateral side after 1 hour of reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
