<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to identify the predictive factors of systemic emboli in patients with MS in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Twenty patients with MS in sinus rhythm with recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and 32 with MS in sinus rhythm without any history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> were studied between January 2004 and May 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and echocardiographic data were assessed using stepwise logistic regression for prediction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.26) and left atrial spontaneous echo contrast (LASEC) grade 3+ and 4+ (OR, 46.42; 95% CI, 5.00-436.49) were associated with, and predictive of systemic emboli, whereas left atrial appendage contraction flow velocities, left atrial size and mitral valve area were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that age and LASEC are the major predictive factors of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> in patients with MS in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It would therefore be prudent to give <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> to patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> as well as to those in sinus rhythm at risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
