<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To develop, implement, and evaluate a pharmacist-led multidisciplinary intervention in a hospital setting that would optimize antithrombotic use in elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that there would be an increase in the proportion of patients receiving antithrombotic therapy at discharge was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Evidence-based algorithms were developed to define the criteria (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk vs contraindications) by which an elderly patient's requirement for antithrombotic therapy was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A major Sydney teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighteen consecutively admitted elderly patients (mean age 85.2) were recruited over a 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: A pharmacist-coordinated multidisciplinary review process was implemented to coordinate risk assessments and subsequently recommend appropriate antithrombotic therapy, as per the algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The proportion of patients receiving antithrombotic therapy was assessed on admission (preintervention), at discharge (postintervention), and postdischarge (follow-up at 3 and 6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As a result of the intervention, 78 patients (35.8%) required changes to their existing antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these changes, 60 (76.9%) were "upgrades" to more-effective treatment options (e.g., from no therapy to any agent or from aspirin to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining 18 (23.1%) changes were "downgrades" to less-effective, albeit safer, options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite a significant increase in anti thrombotic use overall (59.6% vs 81.2%, P&lt;.001), fewer patients received <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> postintervention, after having been assessed as inappropriate candidates (20.7% vs 17.4%, P=.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A pharmacist-led multidisciplinary process was successfully developed and implemented within the hospital setting to increase overall antithrombotic use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Having addressed some of the known barriers and limitations to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use, these algorithms may allow allied health workers, patients, and clinicians to work collaboratively to achieve optimal and, importantly, appropriate (i.e., safe and effective) antithrombotic use in at-risk elderly patients </plain></SENT>
