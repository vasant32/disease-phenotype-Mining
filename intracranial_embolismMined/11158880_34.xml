<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> embolization using Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC) is gaining increasing acceptance as a viable alternative to surgery in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although recent reports describe a significant rate of symptomatic thromboembolic complications with GDC use, many of the neurologic deficits are transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the incidence of silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> with the use of diffusion-weighted imaging and to correlate radiologic findings with the results of neurologic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed within 48 hours in 14 consecutive elective GDC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Embolizations were performed under systemic heparinization; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> flush solutions were heparinized, and both guiding catheters and microcatheters were placed for continuous heparinized infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic examination, including the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale determination, was performed by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neurologist before the coiling procedures were performed, immediately after the procedures were performed, and before discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging examinations were reviewed by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neurologist and an interventional neuroradiologist, with determination and characterization of diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Small areas of restricted diffusion, presumed to represent procedure-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarctions</z:e>, were noted on the images of eight of 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except one of the areas were located ipsilateral to the side of the catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients had evidence of multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most lesions were small (&lt;2 mm); one patient with coil stretch and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> into the parent vessel had numerous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with a dominant posterior frontal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pre- and posttreatment National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores were unchanged for 13 of 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, the rate of asymptomatic emboli was 61% (eight of 13 treatments) in uncomplicated treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> occurred independently of the number of coils used; the mean number of coils used for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was 7.6 (range, two to 13) and for patients without evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 10.2 (range, one to 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This was not a significant difference (P &gt; .5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> related to the use of the GDC system are a common occurrence, despite meticulous technique and systemic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although clinical sequelae are rare, the high rate of occurrence suggests that alterations in the technique, such as the addition of antiplatelet agents, should be considered </plain></SENT>
