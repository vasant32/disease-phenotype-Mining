<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two consecutive patients underwent both duplex ultrasonography examination and cerebral angiography within 24 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cases who had no flow velocity and 8 cases who had systolic flow velocity but no anterograde diastolic flow velocity were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnosed as having internal carotid occlusions by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 22 cases who had anterograde diastolic flow velocity were diagnosed as having occlusions at distal side of M 1 portion or no occluded lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides, among 11 cases who were diagnosed as having occlusions of internal carotid arteries by cerebral angiography, five had end diastolic ratios (ED ratio) of common carotid arteries that were less than 4.0s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is useful to evaluate the existence of anterograde diastolic flow velocity by duplex ultrasonography for the diagnosis of internal carotid occlusions in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
