<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The present study investigated the prevalence of cerebral microemboli detected by transcranial Doppler sonography in unselected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) patients under standard clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and the value of the method for clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 937 consecutive patients who were investigated between October 1995 and August 2004 at our institution were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> were subtyped using the TOAST classification criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-four subjects were excluded because there was an interval of &gt;14 days between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and examination, no definite diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> at discharge, or an artificial heart valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals (ES) were detected in 37 (5.7%) of the remaining 653 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects with positive ES detection the mean interval between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and ES detection was 4.9 (SD 4.0) days compared with 5.4 (SD 3.5) days in the remaining patients (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ES were more common in patients with large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> compared with other subtype groups (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of detected signals was influenced by the antihemostatic treatment: ES were found more often in anticoagulated patients than in patients receiving antiplatelet medication (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study shows a high clinical significance of ES in patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributable to arterio-arterial embolism or of cardiac embolic origin and the high specificity of the technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the low sensitivity shown, ES detection cannot generally be recommended for routine diagnostics in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
