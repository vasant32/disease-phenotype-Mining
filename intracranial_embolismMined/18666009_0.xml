<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection system (EDS) is presented, built with the intention of detecting ongoing cerebral embolization in patients at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is based on the analysis of the audio-Doppler signal of a transcranial Doppler machine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The algorithm of the EDS estimates the intensity, duration and zero-crossing dynamics of the audio signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EDS has a multi-layer neural network which classifies events into micro-emboli signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) or artefacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decision-making component of the software has been validated against human experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from patients in the post-operative phase of carotid surgery were used for the validation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed agreement in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and artefact classification of &gt; 93% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apart from a monitoring display, the monitoring system includes a verification unit that allows the user to listen and to look at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data of individual <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and artefacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the system allows the user to record, store and re-calculate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data are stored using European Data Format, which allows data transportation over the Internet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The EDS may have a potential in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk stratification, evaluating the effect of novel anti-thrombotic therapies, and in peri-operative and remote monitoring of carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
