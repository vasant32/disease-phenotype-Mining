<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols of T(2)-, T(2)*-, diffusion- and susceptibility-weighted imaging (T2WI, T2*WI, DWI, and SWI, respectively) with a 7T system, we tested the hypothesis that treatment of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with erythropoietin (EPO) initiated at 24 hr and administered daily for 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> has benefit in repairing ischemic cerebral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult Wistar rats were subjected to embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by means of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and were randomly assigned to a treatment (n = 11) or a control (n = 11) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treated group was given EPO intraperitoneally at a dose of 5,000 IU/kg daily for 7 days starting 24 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls were given an equal volume of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed at 24 hr and then weekly for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI and histological measurements were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial T2WI demonstrated that expansion of the ipsilateral ventricle was significantly reduced in the EPO-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The volume ratio of ipsilateral parenchymal tissue relative to the contralateral hemisphere was significantly increased after EPO treatment compared with control animals, indicating that EPO significantly reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the ipsilateral hemisphere, although no significant differences in ischemic lesion volume were observed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> and white matter remodeling were significantly increased and occurred earlier in EPO-treated animals than in the controls, as evident from T2*WI and diffusion anisotropy maps, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that EPO treatment initiated 24 hr poststroke promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and axonal remodeling in the ischemic boundary, which may potentially reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
