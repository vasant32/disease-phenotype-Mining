<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> is not rare in elderly individuals over the age of 80 and is usually detected on postmortem microscopic examination of myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a 67-year-old male patient who was clinically diagnosed as having SSA with cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial event was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> conceivably due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endomyocardial biopsy was performed twice, which led to a definitive diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> at the second biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This amyloid was immunolabeled by an anti-TTR antibody and direct DNA sequencing of the TTR gene did not detect any mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical confirmation of SSA in individuals before the age of 70 is infrequent and cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> associated with this disease might have been the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it is important to distinguish cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> of SSA from that of primary immunoglobulin light chain (AL)-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, because the treatment and prognosis differ considerably from those of primary AL <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
