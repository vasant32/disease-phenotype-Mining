<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Isolated left ventricular noncompaction (ILVNC) is a rare congenital condition that is the result of an intrauterine <z:hpo ids='HP_0007281'>developmental arrest</z:hpo>, which stops the compaction of the loose myocardial fiber meshwork of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This condition is recognized by an excessively prominent trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular recesses of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although these intertrabecular recesses are prone to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, with resulting embolic sequelae, the literature describes only 1 adult case of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by ILVNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We describe a case of cerebral cardioembolism in a 33-year-old man due to ILVNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of echocardiography (ECHO) findings in this case, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) was performed, which allowed a definite diagnosis to be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case should highlight the importance of performing cMRI especially in younger patients with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, if the ECHO suggests a suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
