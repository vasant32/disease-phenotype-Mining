<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine the distribution of fat which reaches the brain by the internal carotid artery, and the consequent alterations in the blood brain barrier, in a rat model of cerebral arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the blood flow in this model was determined by the injection of radiolabelled microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over 44% were trapped in the brain, 43% in the extracerebral tissues of the head and neck, and 7% in the lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over 30% of radiolabelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> was present within the brain 30 min after injection, and 4% still remained after 17 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> which went to the brain moved through the cerebral vessels and left within the first 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> distributed to the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, with significantly less to the contralateral cerebral hemisphere, brain stem and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood brain barrier opened, as measured by uptake of 99mTc, within the first 15 min and remained open for at least 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant percentage of fat reaching the brain persists for days, and causes rapid and long-lasting damage to the blood brain barrier </plain></SENT>
