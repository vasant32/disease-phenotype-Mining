<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hour after embolism a significant, though small, reduction in blood flow and oxygen consumption of the embolised hemisphere was recorded, at which time the animals were killed and brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> was reduced in the ipsilateral caudate nucleus, the reported site of maximal ischaemic damage in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> levels were increased in frontal and occipital grey matter sampled from areas surrounding the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory and in similar brain areas of the opposite non-embolised hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">Noradrenaline</z:chebi> was increased in grey matter from both cerebral hemispheres, as well as subcortical structures bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain 5-hydroxytryptamine levels were unaltered, but increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in cisternal cerebrospinal fluid suggested transient alteration in 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolism after embolism </plain></SENT>
