<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous and the visually driven activity were quantitatively analyzed and compared with those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control cells showed a mean response strength of 52.7 impulses/s, this value was increased to 69.3 impulses/s in the vicinity of ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous activity was also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epileptiform burst activity with frequencies above 500 I/s was observed in 37.7% of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Directional and orientational specificity was significantly reduced in these regions because of an increase in responses to stimuli in non-preferred directions and with non-preferred orientations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, an increase in activity-dependent energy consumption occurs in the vicinity of lesions in the ischemically severed cortex </plain></SENT>
