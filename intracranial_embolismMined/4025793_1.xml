<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In severe low-output syndrome hemodynamic parameters are: <z:mp ids='MP_0004876'>reduced mean arterial pressure</z:mp>, increased left ventricular filling pressure, increased mean arterial pulmonary pressure as well as significantly reduced total peripheral resistance [4-6, 28] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inspite of pharmaco-therapy, cardiac performance regarding peripheral perfusion is insufficient; this leads to a vicious cycle of irreversible O2-debt and severe cellular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After haemofiltration there was a significant improvement in the haemodynamic parameters, which in our opinion was due to the elimination of toxic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> such as Myocardial Depressant Factor (MDF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 27 of a total of 29 patients, haemodynamic parameters returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>19 patients were discharged, eight patients died after a number of days or weeks from causes not related to the original cardiogenic shock (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, reinfarction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardiopathy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
