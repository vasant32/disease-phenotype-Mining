<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that the morphological features of plaques may aid in the identification of aortic plaques that are more likely to be associated with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify aortic plaques that are more likely to be associated with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by means of their morphological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcutaneous B-mode ultrasonography was used to image aortic arch plaques in 500 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The criteria used to identify the morphological features of carotid artery plaques that are more likely to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> rather than homogeneous) were applied to aortic arch plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparisons were made using the Fisher exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischemic symptoms (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>) were present in 38% of 104 patients with CAP and in 34% of 391 patients without CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (51%) of 37 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> CAP were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (31%) of 67 patients with homogeneous CAP were symptomatic (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transcutaneous B-mode ultrasonography of the aortic arch can help to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> plaques that are more likely to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> using morphological criteria derived from studies of carotid artery plaque </plain></SENT>
