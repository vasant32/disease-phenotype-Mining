<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Air microbubbles are identified as a contributing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A dynamic bubble trap might reduce the number of gaseous microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 50 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operation were recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 26 patients a dynamic bubble trap was placed between the arterial filter and the aortic cannula (group 1), and in 24 patients a placebo dynamic bubble trap was used (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of high-intensity transient signals within the proximal middle cerebral artery was continuously measured on both sides during bypass, which was separated into 4 periods: phase 1, start of bypass until aortic clamping; phase 2, aortic clamping until rewarming; phase 3, rewarming until clamp removal; and phase 4, clamp removal until end of bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>S100 beta values were measured before, immediately after, and 6 and 48 hours after the operation and before hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The bubble elimination rate during bypass was 77% in group 1 and 28% in group 2 (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of high-intensity signals was lower in group 1 during phase 1 (5.8 +/- 7.3 vs 16 +/- 15.4, P &lt;.05 vs group 2) and phase 2 (6.9 +/- 7.3 vs 24.2 +/- 27.3, P &lt;.05 vs group 2) but not during phases 3 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum S100 beta values were equally increased in both groups immediately after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group 2 patients had higher S100 beta values 6 hours after the operation and significantly higher S100 beta values 48 hours after the operation (0.06 +/- 0.14 vs 0.18 +/- 0.24, P =.0133 vs group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age and S100 beta values were correlated in group 2 but not in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gaseous microemboli can be removed with a dynamic bubble trap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Subclinical cerebral injury detectable by increases of S100 beta disappears earlier after surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
