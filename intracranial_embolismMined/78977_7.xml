<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed impaired circulation in the vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EEG initially showed generalized cerebral dysrhythmia but tended, over the years, to become more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with desynchronized fast activity of low voltage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological examination postmortem revealed a large cystic lesion in the pressure equalization area of the carotid and basilar circulation in the upper pons, mesencephalon, posterior hypothalamus and basal thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No definite stenosis or occlusion was seen in the cerebral vessels on angiography or at the postmortem examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of the lesion is considered to have been temporary interference with the blood flow in the vertebrobasilar system during manipulation of the cervical spine sufficient to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and subsequent infarction of the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of vascular lesions of the brain stem following manipulation of the cervical spine is discussed briefly </plain></SENT>
