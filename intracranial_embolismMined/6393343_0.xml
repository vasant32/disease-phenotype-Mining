<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Doppler findings were controlled by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Doppler sonography turned out to be highly reliable for both the detection and the exclusion of high grade intracranial vertebrobasilar lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The parthognomonic finding was a pathologically altered time profile of extracranial flow with an abrupt deceleration during systole and discontinued flow or even reflux during diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was called a "high resistance flow profile" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, if significant extracranial lesons are also present, the intracranial flow impedance may be masked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The limitations of Doppler sonography in this diagnostic field are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Doppler sonography can provide the basis for a non-invasive differentiation of various types of cerebrovascular disease to define the optimal therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
