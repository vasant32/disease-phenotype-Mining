<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, 1 with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the level of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity was greater than 1.5 times control </plain></SENT>
