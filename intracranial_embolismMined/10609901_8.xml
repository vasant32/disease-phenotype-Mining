<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at a comparative analysis of neurobiochemical markers of brain damage and the neurobehavioral outcome in patients undergoing either valve replacement (VR) or isolated coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to control for well known risk factors both samples were strictly matched according to age, sex and preoperative neuropsychological performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed neurone-specific enolase (NSE) and protein S-100B (S-100B) concentrations in serial venous blood samples taken preoperatively and 1, 6, 20 and 30 h postoperatively in 36 patients undergoing VR (N = 18) or isolated CABG surgery (N = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mini Mental State Examination (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>) was performed preoperatively, 3 and 7 days after surgery and 0.5 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychiatric assessments were based on the diagnosis of postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DMS</z:e>-IIIR criteria and the Brief Psychiatric and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Delirium</z:e> Rating Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VR and CABG patients, respectively, showed an increase of both S-100B (exact two-tailed Wilcoxon signed ranks test: P = 0.0001) and NSE (P = 0.0001) concentrations followed by a decrease during the next 30 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas S-100B values did not differ between patients groups subjects undergoing VR surgery exhibited higher NSE values during the postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, VR patients showed a higher decline in cognitive performance which was also detectable 0.5 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a weak association between the degree of individual postoperative decline of cognitive performance and S-100B area under curve values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that--apart from patients' age and preoperative neuropsychological performance--type of surgery remains a risk factor for postoperative neurobehavioral disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The different vulnerability of neurobehavioral disorders might be mirrored in different postoperative release patterns of NSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We assume that both, NSE release and neurobehavioral disorders might be caused by a higher amount of intraoperative cerebral embolic events in VR patients </plain></SENT>
