<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been shown by bioassay used for monitoring the level of PG-like substances in sagittal sinus blood (ssb) in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> was induced by inhalation of 8% O2 in N2, embolism by an injection of air into internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This led to an increase in the level of PG-like substances in ssb, with no detectable change in the concentration of PGs in peripheral venous blood, indicating that PGs detected in ssb originate from cerebral venous outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The output amounted 6 ng/ml (in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> equivalents) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">Hydrocortisone</z:chebi> (HC) in a dose of 30 mg/kg suppressed the release of PG-like substances induced by either <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> or embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed by radioimmunoassay of PGs in ssb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of PGs E and F2 alpha were elevated following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> as compared to initial values and greatly suppressed by HC administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Suppression of PG formation by HC in this experimental system seems to be related to the membrane--stabilizing action of this hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is of interest in view of the usefulness of steroid therapy in cerebrovascular pathology </plain></SENT>
