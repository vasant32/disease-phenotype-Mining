<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contribution of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the diagnosis of IE and the spectrum of such findings has been only sparsely described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report cranial MRI findings in 12 patients with IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each of the patients had MRI evidence of cerebral embolization, with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> noted in most patients (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical branch infarction was the most common lesion (n = 8), which usually involved the distal middle cerebral artery tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The next most common finding (n = 7) was numerous small embolic lesions which typically lodged in the supratentorial gray-white junction, some of which were clinically silent and many of which enhanced (probable microabscesses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were noted in four patients, most commonly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed multiple frank parenchymal macroabscesses/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebritis</z:e> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A previously unreported finding in septic embolization, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that became infected with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation ("septic infarction"), was noted in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI showed orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most patients studied with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> showed enhancement of lesions (n = 5/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that cranial MRI may be a valuable tool in the evaluation of patients with IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of characteristic cranial MRI lesions, especially of multiple types, may prompt early diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
