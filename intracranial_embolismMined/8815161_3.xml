<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of these signals in 60 patients with increased risk for cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in a control group of 20 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient groups (n = 20) were characterized by either non-rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AFIB) (I) or a history of prosthetic valve surgery with AFIB (II) or without AFIB (III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals were not seen in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group I, 3 patients (15%) demonstrated HITS, in groups II and III 10 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals in patients with prosthetic heart valves (II, III) had a higher signal intensity, indicating different embolic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation of microembolic signals with the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment or the position of the prosthetic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HITS were found in 1/9 (11%) of the patients with a bioprosthetic valve as compared to 19/31 (61%) with a mechanical valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 6-12 months, 1 of 12 HITS positive patients had experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 2 had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the 28 patients without HITS had suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 2 had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals are frequent events in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In these patients they do not appear to be a major prognostic factor for an impending cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
