<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An ultrasound (US) contrast agent was used to artificially produce microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) to imitate the intracranial distribution of systemic emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systemic microemboli were simulated by IV administered US agent (Levovist(R) 300 mg/mL as bolus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 20 patients were monitored by means of transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), 3 min after the injection, with a 2-MHz transducer simultaneously at 50 mm (middle cerebral artery, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, on one side) and 90 mm (basilar artery, BA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four 3-min recordings were done (two of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, two of the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, with the BA, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three observers and an automatic detection system independently performed an off-line analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 160 recordings were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean numbers of detected high-intensity transient signals (HITS) were 34.5 +/- 28.2 in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (simultaneously registered HITS in the BA: 9.4 +/- 16.8) and 39.1 +/- 34.2 in the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (simultaneously registered HITS in the BA: 12.2 +/- 14.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 21.4 to 23.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HITS were recorded in the BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals artificially produced by means of US contrast agent made it possible to mimic the physiologic distribution of small embolic particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In future, these might help to investigate the distribution of systemic emboli in different vascular territories in various pathologic conditions of the cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
