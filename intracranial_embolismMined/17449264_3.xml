<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The use of antithrombotic therapy during the postoperative period after biological aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients without thromboembolic risk factors remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> is recommended for the first 3 months after biological AVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of antiplatelet therapy - mainly aspirin (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) - is suggested as an alternative treatment but its efficacy is still unsettled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to the increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications even no use of any antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy was advocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given this ongoing dispute, the aim of this retrospective double-institutional study was to evaluate the necessity of antiplatelet treatment by <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> with no postoperative antiplatelet therapy in terms of survival, major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> of patients undergoing biological AVR without thromboembolic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2001 to December 2003, 288 consecutive patients (72.8+/-7.5 years, 134 males) with sinus rhythm and no other thromboembolic risk factors underwent single biological AVR with porcine or bovine pericardial valves without concurrent coronary artery bypass graft surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By surgeons preference, 100 mg <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was given to 132 patients, and 156 patients received no antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for cerebral ischemic events, major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp>, need for repeat operation, NYHA class and survival at three time intervals postoperatively (30 days, 3 and 12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients died during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality within 30 days was 3.8% in the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and 3.9% in the no <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> group (p=0.777) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> within 3 months after AVR (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> 0.8% vs no <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> 1.3%: p=0.884) and 3 to 12 months after AVR (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> 0.8% vs no <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> 0%; p=0.933) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> occurred in two <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>-treated patients and in one patient without antiplatelet therapy (p=0.884) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of NYHA class III-IV after 3 months (1.5% vs 1.9%; p=0.850) and 12 months (9.0% vs 5.1%; p=0.278) were similar, as were the need for repeat operative AVR after 12 months (0.8% vs 0.6%; p=0.553) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survival rates at 12-month follow-up were 95.5% for <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> treatment and 94.9% for no <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> treatment (p=0.963) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients without thromboembolic risk factors undergoing biological AVR administration of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> confers no advantage compared to no antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Functional status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and survival were not adversely affected by withholding any antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Guidelines need to be reviewed for the antithrombotic therapy of patients without risk factors undergoing bioprosthetic AVR </plain></SENT>
