<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a striking variety of signs and symptoms caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> embolization, haemodynamic obstruction, and auto-immunological reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis should be made early before the occurrence of irreversible complications, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography is a simple technique for the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> but a negative result does not exclude it, and diagnosis has to be confirmed by angiocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> should be removed as soon as possible after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is danger of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> embolization in the course of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality is low in patients with only haemodynamic complications, but in patients with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> the risk is higher because of possible <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the infarcted areas of the brain resulting from anticoagulation during cardio-pulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the operation is indicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If removal of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> is complete, recurrence is rate and long-term results are good </plain></SENT>
