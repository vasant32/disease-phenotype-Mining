<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the 66 patients with transient hemispheric or ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, potentially embolic lesions were more common than hemodynamically significant lesions (84% versus 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 29 patients with fixed neurologic deficits, 25% had occlusion of the internal carotid artery on the appropriate side; ulcerated lesions were again more common in the remaining patent arteries than were hemodynamically significant lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major difference between the transient group and the fixed group was the 29% incidence of intracerebral disease or anomaly in the transient group, with similar lesions in 90% of the group with fixed neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are more likely to be related to ulceration than to hemodynamically significant lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> seems greatest when there is also intracerebral siphon disease or anatomic anomaly of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
