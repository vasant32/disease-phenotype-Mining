<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Less than half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects display a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> configuration of the Circle of Willis, according to anatomical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variations of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) such as duplication or accessory <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> are infrequent but nevertheless have important clinical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the case of two patients with these variations of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and their repercussions in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Case 1: a 53 year old male with a 2 hour history of sensory motor syndrome; a transcranial Doppler (TCD) scan revealed asymmetrical speeds in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was suspected and we therefore decided to perform a magnetic resonance angiography scan before administering fibrinolytics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The magnetic resonance angiography scan showed an accessory <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lying ipsilateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We interpreted the anomalies in blood flow detected in the TCD recording as being secondary to this anatomical variation and not due to reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following the magnetic resonance angiography study, the possibility of fibrinolysis was ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered the neurological deficit in a matter of hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Case 2: a 21 year old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, who was diagnosed as suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Later, following another <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, it was shown that the previous clinical symptoms had been secondary to intracranial dissection with embolism in the lenticulostriate arteries and ischemic infarction in that territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance angiography scan showed duplication of the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The double vascularisation of the hemisphere in cases of anatomical duplication can give rise to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with a better progression and prognosis, despite the occlusion of one of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of anatomical variations of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> can lead to mistaken interpretations of the transcranial Doppler scan and may affect decision making as regards the therapy to be employed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
