<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Carotid ligation was performed in a series of 30 consecutive cases of infraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, of which 6 had not ruptured, and 9 cases of supraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were operated on before, and 18 after, the eleventh day after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The internal carotid artery was primarily ligated in four cases, with two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and in one case lasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the rest of the cases, the common carotid artery was primarily ligated without operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After varying intervals, the internal carotid artery was ligated both in the neck and intracranially in 25 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three cases late complications occurred due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, resulting in one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four cases there were transient symptoms caused by insufficient cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cerebral circulation was investigated in 23 cases using an intravenous isotope technique before and after ligation of the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In each of the cases the circulatory values were sufficient, with a slight diminishing of the flow on the ligated side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After ligation of the internal carotid artery at a later stage the flow in both hemispheres increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding has been interpreted as being due to the interruption by internal carotid ligation of the retrograde internal carotid flow that occurs after common carotid ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In five cases aorto-cervical angiography was performed some months after ligation of the common carotid artery, and in four a retrograde flow in the internal carotid artery on the ligated side was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In accordance with the results obtained suggestions are made for carotid ligation in the treatment of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> not accessible for neck ligation </plain></SENT>
