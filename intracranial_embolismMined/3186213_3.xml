<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the saccadic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo> caused by ocular lateropulsion was recorded during memory-guided saccades in the same manner as visually guided saccades, the eyes reached precisely the intended position by corrective saccades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean latency of corrective saccades was significantly longer than that of corrective saccades observed for visually guided saccades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This long latency of corrective saccades supports the assumption that feedback information of the eye position is a signal generated by orbital afferents rather than a copy of the motor command </plain></SENT>
