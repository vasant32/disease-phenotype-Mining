<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evoked cerebral potentials have been accepted as a technical method of confirmation of clinical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 32 patients with the signs of apneic brain-stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001284'>areflexia</z:hpo> acoustic evoked brain-stem potentials and median-evoked somatosensory potentials were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In supratentorial lesions evoked potentials are adequate to confirm complete cessation of brain function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three cases of primary brain-stem disease evoked potentials were abolished, however, unequivocal EEG activity was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The registration of evoked potentials is sufficient to confirm the brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome in primary supratentorial lesions, in infratentorial disease, however, demonstration of isoelectric EEG is necessary </plain></SENT>
