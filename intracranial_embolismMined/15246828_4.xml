<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Caffeinol is currently being tested in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the pharmacology or safety of caffeinol in preclinical embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the pharmacological effects of caffeinol administration on clinical rating scores in rabbits following small clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (RSCEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male New Zealand white rabbits were embolized by injecting blood clots into the cerebral circulation via a carotid catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral analysis was conducted 24 h following embolization, allowing for the determination of the effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> dose (P50) or clot amount (mg) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the P50 values for the control groups were 1.32 +/- 0.23 and 1.66 +/- 0.29 mg for the bolus-injected and infused groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rabbits treated with caffeinol (bolus) starting 15 min following embolization had a P50 value of 1.70 +/- 1.18 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Caffeinol-infused rabbits had a P50 value of 2.05 +/- 0.47 and 1.67 +/- 0.48 mg for low- and high-dose <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In tPA-treated rabbits (0.9 mg/kg), the group P50 was 1.58 +/- 0.43 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In caffeinol (bolus) and tPA-treated rabbits, we measured a decrease in the P50 value to 0.70 +/- 0.30 mg and an increase in the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This primary finding of this study indicates that neither bolus-injected nor infused caffeinol affects behavioral deficits following embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the combination of caffeinol plus low-dose tPA does not improve behavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, our study suggests that there is the potential for exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced behavioral deficits following caffeinol administration in combination with a thrombolytic that may be related to increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
