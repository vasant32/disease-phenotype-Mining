<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is superior to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> that may result in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical importance of these abnormalities is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We classified 96 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients into high- or low-risk groups for cardioembolism based on historical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, atrial smoke, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, and plaque in the ascending aorta was assessed with TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> type and other possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> occurred only in the high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>Patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, and most cases of left atrial smoke occurred in the presence of another embolic source or were associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> related to hypertensive small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protruding atherosclerotic plaque in the ascending aorta and aortic arch was the most significant cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> diagnosed by TEE because it frequently occurred in those without other risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TEE identified aortic plaque in one and left atrial smoke in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> without risk factors for small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TEE should be considered in both lacunar and nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that occur in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, although optimal management of most TEE findings is yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
