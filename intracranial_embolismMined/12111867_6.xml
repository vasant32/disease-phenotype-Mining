<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to characterize alterations in the adenylyl cyclase (AC), cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), and spatial memory function after sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by injection of 900 microspheres (48 microm in diameter) into the right (ipsilateral) hemisphere of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the AC and cAMP in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were examined up to 7 days after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A decrease in the cAMP content was seen in the ipsilateral hemisphere throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microsphere embolism (ME) decreased the activity of Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-sensitive AC in the ipsilateral hemisphere throughout the experiment, whereas the basal and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24460">5'-guanylyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48497">imidodiphosphate</z:chebi> (Gpp(NH)p)-sensitive AC activities were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting analysis of AC subtypes with specific antibodies showed a decrease in the immunoreactivity of AC-I in the ipsilateral hemisphere during these periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the immunoreactivity of AC-V/VI and AC-VIII were observed after ME </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-binding proteins Galpha(s), Galpha(i), and Gbetawere unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, microsphere-embolized rats showed prolongation of the escape latency in the water maze task determined on the seventh to ninth day after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may induce the impairment of the AC, particularly a selective reduction in the AC-I level and activity, coupled with the decrease in cAMP content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This reduction may play an appreciable role in the disturbance in cAMP-mediated signal transduction system, possibly leading to learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
