<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: During transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR), multiple microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) can be detected in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to characterize composition and clinical relevance of these <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and to evaluate strategies to reduce cerebral microembolization during TMLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: TMLR was performed in pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laser energy was set to 4-10 J (group A) or 80 J (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oxygen concentration was varied between 21 and 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were recorded in the ophthalmic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain and spinal cord were investigated histologically after 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> could be detected during high- compared to low-energy laser procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ventilation with 100% oxygen reduced the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No lesions were found on histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> depends on the laser energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Laser-induces cavitation-effects lead to an additional release of nitrogen bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the microembolic load can be reduced by ventilation with 100% oxygen and by decreasing the laser energy </plain></SENT>
