<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive imaging tools that better characterize arterial wall, and atherosclerotic plaque structure and composition may help to determine the factors which lead to the development of unstable lesions, and identify patients at risk of plaque disruption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging allows for the characterization of carotid vessel wall and plaque composition, the characterization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological arterial wall, the quantification of plaque size, and the detection of plaque integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, various ultrasound (US) measurements have also been used to quantify <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, intima-media thickness, total plaque volume, total plaque area, and vessel wall volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combining the complementary information provided by 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and US carotid images may lead to a better understanding of the underlying compositional and textural factors that define plaque and wall vulnerability, which may lead to better and more effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention strategies and patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combining these images requires nonrigid registration to correct the nonlinear misalignments caused by relative twisting and bending in the neck due to different head positions during the two image acquisition sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high degree of freedom and large number of parameters associated with existing nonrigid image registration methods causes several problems including unnatural plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alteration, high computational complexity, and low reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, a "twisting and bending" model was used with only six parameters to model the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> movement of the neck for nonrigid registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The registration technique was evaluated using 3D US and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> carotid images at two field strengths, 1.5 and 3.0 T, of the same subject acquired on the same day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean registration error between the segmented carotid artery wall boundaries in the target US image and the registered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images was calculated using a distance-based error metric after applying a "twisting and bending" model based nonrigid registration algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An average registration error of 1.4 +/- 0.3 mm was obtained for 1.5 T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm for 3.0 T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, when registered with 3D US images using the nonrigid registration technique presented in this paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Visual inspection of segmented vessel surfaces also showed a substantial improvement of alignment with this nonrigid registration technique compared to rigid registration </plain></SENT>
