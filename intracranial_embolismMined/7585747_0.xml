<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transesophageal echocardiograms of 30 consecutive patients who underwent surgical closure of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001684'>secundum atrial septal defect</z:hpo> were compared with those of 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001684'>secundum atrial septal defect</z:hpo>, the maximal diameter (mean +/- SD) of the fossa ovalis was 21.73 +/- 3.43 compared to 11.43 +/- 1.00 mm in the control group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 7 (23%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, the mean maximal diameter of the fossa ovalis was 25.28 +/- 3.03 compared to 20.65 +/- 2.78 mm in those without an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> was smaller in patients with than in those without an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> who had a history of a cerebrovascular event, the interatrial communication was only detected by contrast echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> tend to be smaller but the incidence of cerebrovascular events is greater </plain></SENT>
