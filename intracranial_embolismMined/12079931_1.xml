<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1990 and 2000, 18 patients (6 males, 12 females), aged 24 to 73 years (mean, 55.3 years), were operated on for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common location of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> was the left atrium (78%), and the transseptal surgical approach was preferred (78%) as it allows total resection of the left <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> along with its pedicle </plain></SENT>
