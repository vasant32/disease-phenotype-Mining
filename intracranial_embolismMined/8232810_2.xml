<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty monkeys were randomly assigned to one of five groups of four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each group underwent baseline cerebral angiography followed by bilateral craniectomy and experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An Ommaya reservoir was inserted on the right side with its catheter placed into the ipsilateral subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, depending upon group assignment, the animals received 100,000 IU URO, 200,000 IU URO, 1 mg rt-PA, 2 mg rt-PA, or the equivalent volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On Day 7, angiography was repeated and the animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One animal died as a result of complications during the baseline angiography, presumably due to blood loss and prolonged anesthesia, and a replacement animal was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No animals demonstrated any delayed neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrated that a single intracisternal bolus injection of rt-PA, 2.0 mg in 2 ml <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> water, or URO, 200,000 IU in 2 ml <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> water, 24 hours after induction of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in primates, was equally effective in thrombolysing ipsilateral clot, but neither dosage prevented angiographic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm occurred bilaterally in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whereas gross subarachnoid clot was found bilaterally in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals in the placebo group and both smaller-dose URO and rt-PA groups, right-sided subarachnoid clot was virtually absent and left-sided clot reduced in both higher-dose URO and rt-PA groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
