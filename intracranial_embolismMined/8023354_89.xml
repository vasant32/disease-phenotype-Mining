<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the incidence of high-intensity transcranial signals (microemboli) and their relation to changes in neuropsychological performance after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity and detect microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of high-intensity transcranial signals was determined and related to a neurological examination and absolute changes in neuropsychological performance as well as the number of patients considered to exhibit a neuropsychological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were available on 100 consenting patients undergoing routine cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty of the patients were randomly assigned to a procedure that included a 40-microns arterial line filter, and 50 had the procedure without any arterial line filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly more patients were found to have neuropsychological deficits in the group without the arterial line filter at both 8 days (P &lt; .05) and 8 weeks (P &lt; .03) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, more "soft" neurological signs were found in the nonfiltered group 24 hours after surgery (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More high-intensity transcranial signals were found in the nonfiltered group, and the number of high-intensity transcranial signals was found to be related to the likelihood of a patient having a neuropsychological deficit at 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that neuropsychological deficits after routine cardiopulmonary bypass are related to the number of microemboli delivered during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the numbers of microemboli may be reduced by including a 40-microns filter on the arterial line </plain></SENT>
