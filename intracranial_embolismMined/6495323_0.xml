<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No atrial activity was recorded from the right atrium which did not respond to stimulation with up to 10 volts </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The atrium then responded to electrical stimulation (less than 2 volts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persistent sinus node activity with intraatrial block was found during post-pacing atrial pauses </plain></SENT>
