<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Filter cerebral protection during carotid stenting has been proposed as a new tool to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiographic findings (filter patency), pathological analysis of the collected materials inside the filters and coagulation parameters were analyzed to identify potential down sides in the use of these protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 29 consecutive endovascular treatments with filter cerebral protection in 27 patients affected by symptomatic internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>&gt;70% were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographic findings, activated clotting times and histopathologic specimens were recorded and correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Satisfactory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the stenosis was always achieved with a complication rate of 3% (1 transient neurological deficit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the procedure, 9 filters (31%) appeared occluded, with temporary flow impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic examination demonstrated material inside the filters in 86% of cases but this material was fibrin alone in 38% and plaque debris in 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant statistical correlation (p=0.009) was found between low activated clotting time and occlusion of the filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Distal protection filters can collect plaque fragments occurring during carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant proportion of the debris found in the filters consisted of thrombotic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Precise monitoring of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> anticoagulation is recommended to prevent filter occlusion </plain></SENT>
