<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the incidence of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> after complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) ablation with or without PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) patients (50 paroxysmal and 50 persistent, including 10 longstanding) who underwent CFAE ablation combined with (n = 41, PVI+CFAE group) or without (n = 59, CFAE group) PVI were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography (CAG) was conducted with AF ablation in 5 cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> was suspected on 3D-computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PVI was performed before CFAE ablation without circular catheter during AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After termination of AF, additional ablation was performed to complete PVI with a circular catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted MRI and T2-weighted MRI the day after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: New <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was detected in 7.0%, and there was no significant difference between the 2 strategies (7.3% in PVI+CFAE group, 6.8% in CFAE group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CHADS2 score (1.6 ± 1.0 vs 0.8 ± 0.9, P &lt; 0.05), left atrial volume (LAV; 83.8 ± 27.1 vs 67.8 ± 21.8, P &lt; 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, 53.1 ± 9.2 vs 65.1 ± 9.7, P &lt; 0.01) were significantly different when comparing patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, LVEF (odds ratio [OR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.99; P &lt; 0.05) and concomitant CAG (OR 18.82; 95% CI, 1.77-200.00; P &lt; 0.05) were important predictors of new cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of cerebral microthromboembolism after CFAE ablation was not greater than previous reports in PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cautious management is required during AF ablation, especially in the patients with low LVEF </plain></SENT>
