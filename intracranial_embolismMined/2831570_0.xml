<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thromboemboli were induced in the middle cerebral artery of 21 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urokinase was started at different time intervals after infarction (1, 3 and 5 hours) at a rate of 1000 IU/kg/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographically controlled thrombolysis was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 treated cases, whereas in the control group (n = 6) no case of recanalisation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic fibrinolysis occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postmortem examinations of the brains showed no intracerebral haemorrhages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that urokinase treatment may be of value in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
