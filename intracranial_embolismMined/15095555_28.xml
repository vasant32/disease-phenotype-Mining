<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors present Phase I data of the CLOTBUST (Combined Lysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> using transcranial Ultrasound and Systemic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Nonrandomized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> on a prebolus TCD receiving intravenous 0.9 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> within 3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were monitored with portable diagnostic TCD equipment and a standard headframe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization was defined as thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> (TIBI) flow grades 4-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 55 patients (mean age 69 +/- 15 years, median baseline NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale [NIHSS] 18, range 4-29, 90% with 3 9 points) were treated at 125 +/- 36 minutes from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring began at 117 +/- 39 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization on TCD within 2 hours after bolus was found in 20 patients (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dramatic recovery (NIHSS score &lt; or = 3) occurred in 20% at 2 hours and in 24% at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall improvement by &gt; or = 4 NIHSS points was found in 49% at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvement was associated with recanalization during or shortly after <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> infusion (phi r2 = .5, P = .03); however, in 6/20 patients with complete recanalization (30%), no immediate clinical change was noticed within 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate was 5.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Continuous TCD insonation for up to 2 hours at maximum intensities allowed by current bio-safety guidelines is safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dramatic recovery and complete recanalization shortly after <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> bolus are feasible goals for thrombolysis given with TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
