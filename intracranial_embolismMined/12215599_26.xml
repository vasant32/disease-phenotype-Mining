<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been proposed that the novel thrombolytic microplasmin may be useful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study the effects and safety profile of microplasmin were evaluated in 2 rabbit embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models that have been used successfully to develop tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) as the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rabbit small clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model (RSCEM) and rabbit large clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model (RLCEM) were used to determine the potential neuroprotective properties and safety profile of microplasmin, respectively, after an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbits were embolized by injecting small blood clots (RSCEM) or large blood clots (RLCEM) into the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the RSCEM, 126 rabbits were included, with behavioral analysis conducted 24 hours later, allowing for determination of the effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> dose (ES50) or clot amount (milligrams) that produces severe neurological deficits in 50% of rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For RLCEM safety study analysis, 47 rabbits were included, with postmortem analyses consisting of assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate and size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In test animals microplasmin was infused intravenously 60 minutes after embolization, whereas control rabbits were given infusions of the saline/Plasma-Lyte vehicle with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assessments performed in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the RSCEM, a drug is considered neuroprotective if it significantly increases the ES50 compared with the vehicle-treated control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ES50 of the vehicle-treated control group 24 hours after embolization was 1.36+/-0.42 mg (n=38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microplasmin, infused starting 60 minutes after embolization, increased the ES50 to 2.32+/-0.57 (n=21), 1.89+/-0.48 (n=21), 2.81+/-0.55 (n=22), and 1.89+/-0.28 mg (n=24) for the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-mg/kg doses, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant behavioral improvement in the 4-mg/kg dose arm (P=0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The microplasmin dose of microplasmin that was statistically significant (4 mg/kg) was subsequently determined to be safe in the RLCEM because it did not increase the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> (56%) compared with vehicle-treated rabbits (63%), nor did it significantly alter <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volume, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that microplasmin improves behavioral rating scores in the RSCEM when administered 60 minutes after embolization, at a dose that does not increase <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> in the RLCEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to tPA, which significantly enhances the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate in the RLCEM </plain></SENT>
