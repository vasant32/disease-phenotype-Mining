<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We carried out three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA in six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> treated by local thrombolysis, and compared the findings with those of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, MRA before thrombolysis clearly demonstrated the occluded arteries, which corresponded precisely to those shown by DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In four patients with complete recanalisation of the occluded vessels after thrombolysis, the recanalisation could be demonstrated by postoperative MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient with reocclusion of the recanalised artery, repeat MRA also demonstrated the reocclusion, confirmed by DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MRA may be helpful for noninvasive investigation before and after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
