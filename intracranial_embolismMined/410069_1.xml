<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The earliest CT changes are noted by 12 to 24 hours and include generalized ventricular enlargement and a focal region of decreased absorption in the opercula-basal ganglia region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The area of diminished brain absorption is better circumscribed and of lower attenuation coefficient with increasing chronicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo> and ventricular displacement occurred with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Little additional diagnostic information was obtained via intravenous enhancement and care should be taken as mild enhancement may obscure an area of abnormality </plain></SENT>
