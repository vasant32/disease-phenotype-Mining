<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The safety limit of retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) in aortic arch reconstruction was evaluated in comparison with long (&gt; or = 60 min: group A = 28 cases) and short (&lt; 60 min: group B = 88 cases) RCP time (RCPT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RCPT was 60-94 min in group A and 24-59 min in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 7.1% and 6.8% in group A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no case who was died due to cerebral insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative neurological complication was observed 3 in group A and 3 in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significance between 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the time to awake, ICU stay, electroencephalogram, and cognitive functions between 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, the safety limit of RCP is over than 60 min and, maybe, about 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We monitored the increase of deoxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbR) during RCP using a near infrared spectroscopy (n = 55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since HbR increased gradually during RCP, HbR reflects oxygen metabolism non-invasively in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HbR can be one of useful indexes of the brain protection during RCP </plain></SENT>
