<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in infants undergoing operations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> has not been well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as assessed by postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), characterize the neuroanatomic features of focal ischemic injury, and identify risk factors for its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brain MRI was performed in 122 infants 3 to 14 days after cardiac operation with cardiopulmonary bypass, with or without deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors were tested by logistic regression for univariate and multivariate associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was identified in 12 of 122 patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> were preoperative in 6 patients and possibly intraoperative or postoperative in the other 6 patients, and were clinically silent except in 1 patient who had clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial-occlusive and watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were identified with equal distribution in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified lower birth weight, preoperative intubation, lower intraoperative hematocrit, and higher blood pressure at admission to the cardiac intensive care unit postoperatively as significant factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Prematurity</z:e>, younger age at operation, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, and use of deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> were not significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in infants undergoing operations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> was 10%, half of which occurred preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most were clinically silent and undetected without neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and hypoperfusion, with patient-specific, procedure-specific, and postoperative contributions to increased risk </plain></SENT>
