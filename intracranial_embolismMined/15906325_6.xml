<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the ability of map-ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique) to classify the different categories of ischemic damage in the lesion and to evaluate a combined (thrombolysis plus antiplatelet) treatment efficacy in an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats subjected to embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with (N=12) and without (N=10) rt-PA and 7E3 F(ab')2 treatment (4 hours after embolization) were followed (at 2, 24, and 48 hours post-MCAO) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using T1, T2, and apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCw) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ISODATA was computed from T1, T2, and ADCw maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The signatures characterized by the map-ISODATA were compared with histological quantitative evaluation and were employed to demarcate the specific regions in the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The signature described by map-ISODATA is highly correlated with the degree of tissue damage in the lesion and can distinguish the severity of ischemic tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based upon map-ISODATA, ischemic lesion area can be divided into three specific regions, each characterized by a distinct evolution of injury and treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined treatment significantly reduces the lesion size between 24 and 48 hours and improves the outcome 48 hours post-MCAO compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Map-ISODATA provides an accurate means to identify lesion area, to distinguish ischemic damage, and to detect treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>7E3 F(ab')2 extends the rt-PA treatment window to at least four hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of rat </plain></SENT>
