<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goals of this study were (1) to compare the frequency, number, and size of new DWI lesions after unprotected and protected CAS; and (2) to determine the clinical significance of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DWI was performed immediately before and within 48 hours after unprotected or protected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome measures were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of patients with any new ipsilateral DWI lesion (49% versus 67%; P&lt;0.05) as well as the number of new ipsilateral DWI lesions (median=0; interquartile range [IQR]=0 to 3 versus median=1; IQR=0 to 4; P&lt;0.05) were significantly lower after protected (n=139) than unprotected (n=67) CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The great majority of these lesions were asymptomatic and less than 10 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there were no significant differences in clinical outcome between patients treated and not treated with protection devices (7.5% versus 4.3%, not significant), the number of new DWI lesions was significantly higher in patients who developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (median=7.5; IQR=1.5 to 17) than in patients who did not (median=0; IQR=1 to 3.25; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of cerebral protection devices significantly reduces the incidence of new DWI lesions after CAS of which the majority are asymptomatic and less than 10 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequent occurrence of these lesions and their close correlation with the clinical outcome indicates that DWI could become a sensitive surrogate end point in future randomized trials of unprotected versus protected CAS </plain></SENT>
