<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a new-generation transcranial Doppler ultrasound, we compared the number and nature of microemboli in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting during performance of proximal anastomoses with three techniques: an aortic side-biting clamp and two clampless devices (the Enclose II device [Novare Surgical Systems, Inc, Cupertino, Calif] and the Heartstring II device [Guidant Corporation, Santa Clara, Calif]) developed to obviate the need for an aortic side-biting clamp, thereby reducing the number of cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bilateral continuous monitoring of the middle cerebral arteries was performed with a multirange, multifrequency transcranial Doppler device that both automatically rejects artifacts online and discriminates between solid and gaseous microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recordings were continuously undertaken during performance of 66 proximal aortic anastomoses in 42 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five anastomoses were performed with an aortic side-biting clamp, 20 with the Enclose device, and 11 the Hearstring device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most microemboli occurred during application/insertion and removal of each device from the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median number (interquartile range) of total microemboli was 11 (6-32) during side clamping, 11 (6-15) with the Enclose device, 40 (31-48) with the Heartstring device (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of solid microemboli was significantly higher in the side-clamp group (23%) compared with 6% and 1% in the Enclose and Heartstring groups, respectively (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Avoidance of aortic side clamping results in a significant reduction in the proportion of solid microemboli detected with transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As solid microemboli are probably the most damaging, use of the Enclose and Heartstring devices may represent an important strategy for minimizing cerebral injury during proximal aortic anastomoses </plain></SENT>
