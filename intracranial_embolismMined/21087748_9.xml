<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We describe initial human experience with a novel cerebral embolic protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral emboli</z:e> are the major cause of procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during percutaneous aortic valve interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With right radial artery access, the embolic protection device is advanced into the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Once deployed a porous membrane shields the brachiocephalic trunk and the left carotid artery deflecting emboli away from the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Embolic material is not contained or removed by the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The device was used in 4 patients (mean age 90 years) with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> undergoing aortic balloon valvuloplasty (n = 1) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Correct placement of the embolic protection device was achieved without difficulty in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuous brachiocephalic and aortic pressure monitoring documented equal pressures without evidence of obstruction to cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional procedural time due to the use of the device was 13 min (interquartile range: 12 to 16 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pre-discharge cerebral magnetic resonance imaging found no new defects in any of 3 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation and a new 5-mm <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 1 asymptomatic patient after balloon valvuloplasty alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient developed new neurological symptoms or clinical findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve intervention seems feasible and might have the potential to reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
