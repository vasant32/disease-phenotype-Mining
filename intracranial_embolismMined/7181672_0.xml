<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In study (A), niceritrol, 750 mg/day was given for initial period of 12 weeks and 1,500 mg/day was prescribed for an additional 12 weeks to 12 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In six of them, the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (Ch) levels were less than 45 mg/100 ml with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma cholesterol levels and with plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels of less than 250 mg/100 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining six subjects, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-Ch, plasma cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits except in one subject having a higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level, 213 mg/100 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> were fractionated by sequential ultracentrifugation and analyzed for cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>(PL), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi>(Apo) B and Apo A-I, every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Niceritrol decreased plasma-Ch, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-Ch, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-Ch, plasma-TG, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-TG, plasma-PL, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-PL and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-PL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Niceritrol increased <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-Ch and the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-Ch/<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-Ch ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects were more significant for the dose of 1,500 mg/day than 750 mg/day and were more marked in the patients with lower pretreatment <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-Ch levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apo B level at 20 weeks was significantly lower than that before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial plasma Apo A-I levels of the patients were approximately one-half of the control plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After treatment with niceritrol, Apo A-I concentration tended to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In study (B), changes of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> concentration in HDL2 and HDL3 fraction were investigated in 5 patients during treatment with niceritrol, 1,500 mg/day for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">Lipoproteins</z:chebi> were analyzed every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HDL2-Ch levels tended to increase without significant changes of HDL3-Ch levels and HDL2-Ch/HDL3-Ch ratio showed a tendency to increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A significantly but weakly inverse correlation between changes of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-TG and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-Ch was observed, suggesting that the increment of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> might be due partly to promoted lipolysis of TG-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, it was suggested that the effects of niceritrol on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> synthesis in the liver and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> catabolism should be considered </plain></SENT>
