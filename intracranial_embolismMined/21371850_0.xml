<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Thoracic endograft placement has become an acceptable treatment alternative to open repair of the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral embolization when manipulating the aortic arch during cardiac catheterization is well described, but the influence of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) on this event remains poorly studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to quantify the number of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) during different stages of TEVAR and correlate them with landing zones, subclavian revascularization, and postoperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TCD was used to monitor 20 patients during TEVAR for the treatment of thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi>) in 17 (85%) patients, followed by three (15%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and one (5%) Crawford type I thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (TAAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging and medical parameters were entered into a combined database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD signals were recorded digitally for the entire case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, velocities, and pulsatility index values were entered into a combined database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> calculated for the diagnostic phase before TEVAR placement and during the treatment phase for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases combined was 1081 and 1141, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts were generated by the pigtail catheter placement during the diagnostic phase and by device placement during the treatment phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Embolic count to right/left sides was equal overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the diagnostic phase, an average of nine <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were seen right/left, whereas during the treatment phase, 45 and 43 MES were seen, respectively, for right/left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between the total number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (P = .0055), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P = .0053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD can detect microemboli during TEVAR and is able to identify the procedural aspects most associated with cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
