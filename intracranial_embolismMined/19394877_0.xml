<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the transcranial Doppler (TCD) to monitor <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and the Doppler ultrasound to classify carotid plaques in newly symptomatic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>)), formerly symptomatic (relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> per anamnesis) and asymptomatic patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-related arteries evidenced a significantly greater presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-related and asymptomatic arteries (p=0.04), with no significant difference found between the latter two groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: 42/90, 46.7%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>: 15/49, 30.6%; asymptomatic: 40/130, 30.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for anti-platelet treatment did not change this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of stenosis, ultrasonic characteristics of texture and the density of plaques were not found to be associated with the presence or quantity of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MESs are present significantly more often in stenosed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related carotid arteries as compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-related or asymptomatic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither the ultrasonic characteristics nor the degree of stenosis were found to influence the presence or rate of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
