<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prominent vascular changes of the brain were <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, fibrinoid degeneration, endothelial swelling and proliferation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e>, and perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From clinico-pathological viewpoints, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> seemed to play an important role in the development of neurological signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five cases, characteristic granular or homogeneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were observed in the small blood vessels including venule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> without proved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular obstruction</z:e> but probably due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was seen in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The true character of the granular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> was not determined, either electronmicroscopically or immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These suggested the presence of a tendency for in situ formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fibrinoid degeneration seen in four cases mainly affected arterile of less than 50 micrometer in diameter in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This change of arteriole did not play a significant role in neurological signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endothelial swelling and proliferation of the small blood vessels were prominent in the cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fibrinoid degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Perivascular infiltration of the inflammatory cells was observed in about one-half of the cases but its significance was not clear </plain></SENT>
