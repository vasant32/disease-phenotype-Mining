<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the 6 cases in which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> predominated on the paralyzed side, it occurred early, the deficiency affecting the upper limb in particular and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbance</z:e> being irregular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Attempted numeration of the motor units remaining, according to the "incremential" method of stimulation, suggests a numerical reduction on the hemipelgic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite reservations and general criticisms of this method, its comparative value, although approximate, must be acknowledged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>amyotrophy</z:hpo> presumes a transsynaptic change in trophic function to have taken place in the peripheral neurone, neuronal depopulation--if one accepts it--cannot be other than functional </plain></SENT>
