<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for embolization of particles during CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty consecutive patients undergoing conventional multi-vessel CABG were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plaques of the ascending aorta were determined by epiaortic ultrasonography prior to aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intra-aortic filters (Embol-X, Mountain View, CA) were inserted before removal of the aortic cross-clamp and extracted after end of cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Filters underwent histologic analysis at a core lab (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average number of proximal anastomoses was 2.2 (SD 0.55, range 1-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had particles in the filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average number of particles per filter was 10.5 (SD 5.4, range 2-23) with a mean surface area of 8.1mm(2) (SD 9.3, range 0.3-51.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fibrous atheroma was extracted from 85% (34/40) of the filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression explained 46% (r(2)=0.46, P&lt;0.001) of the number of particles harvested by the filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most important independent risk factors for particles were number/grade of atheromas in the ascending aorta (P&lt;0.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.02) and number of proximal anastomoses (P&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Atheroma in the ascending aorta is the most important risk factor for particle embolization during CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The number of particles correlated with the extent of atheromatous disease in the ascending aorta and logistic regression identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the number of proximal anastomoses to have significant influence on the number of captured particulates </plain></SENT>
