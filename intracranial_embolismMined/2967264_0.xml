<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lesions involved one coronary vessel in 24 patients, two in 34, and three or more vessels in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary patient success rate was 96%, and we successfully dilated 162 (91%) of 179 significant (i.e., greater than 70% obstructive) coronary lesions, mean 2.4 lesions/patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete coronary revascularization was achieved in 24 patients (Group 1), while major narrowings were not dilated either by intention or due to failure of dilation in 42 others (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical state of the patients improved markedly after successful PTCA, and 44 (72%) of 61 were in the New York Heart Association Functional Class I or II 3 to 24 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the clinical results, there was a significant improvement in treadmill exercise performance, in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with complete revascularization, however, tended to exercise longer (NS) to a greater heart rate (P less than 0.004) with less or no ischemic ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> on ECG (P less than 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications were few and limited to patients undergoing PTCA for unstable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> or following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient (1%) died, two (3%) had Q-wave infarction and one patient sustained a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> during catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Restenosis was observed in 6 (29%) of 21 consecutive patients recatheterized 6 to 12 months (or sooner for symptoms) after successful PTCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients underwent a repeat PTCA, one was referred for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and in one restenosis was minor and symptoms were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PTCA should be considered in patients with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenoses</z:e> in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or most of the significant lesions can be dilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Partial revascularization by PTCA is clinically useful and may be preferable to CABG in patients in whom the surgical risk is increased </plain></SENT>
