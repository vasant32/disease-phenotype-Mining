<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A matched case-control study was performed between 1993 and 1996 in 16 centers in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Austria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to determine the influence of oral contraceptives (OC), particularly those containing modern <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi>, on the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in women aged 16-44 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 220 women who had had an incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and were compared with 775 control subjects who were unaffected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least one hospital and one community control subject per patient was matched and interviewed with the corresponding patient for 5-year age band and for area of residence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crude odds ratios (95% confidence intervals [CI]) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For current use of any OC versus no use 2.3 (1.7-3.2), the adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.6 (2.4-5.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OC associated risk was higher for first generation than for second or third generation OC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk estimates for patients versus community control subjects were always lower than for hospital control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No major regional difference of the risk estimates was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with nonusers of OC without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who used OC had an almost 10-fold increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, OC users who had had a blood pressure check before OC prescription had a lower risk than did those without such a check </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Smoking &gt; 10 cigarettes/day is associated with higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, particularly for OC users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant effect was found for duration of OC use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although there is a small relative risk of occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for healthy women currently using OC, the attributable risk is very small because the incidence in this age group is very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The small increase in risk of OC use may be further reduced by preventive efforts for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and smoking </plain></SENT>
