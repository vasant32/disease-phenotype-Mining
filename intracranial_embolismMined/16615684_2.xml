<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective clinical trial compared the effect of an auto-venting arterial line filter on intraoperative cerebral microemboli and NP outcome compared to an arterial line filter with a vent line, in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and ten patients received either an Avecor Affinity (n =73) or Pall AV-6 (n =37) control filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli during cardiopulmonary bypass were recorded by transcranial Doppler monitoring of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evidence of cerebral impairment was obtained by comparing patients' performance in a NP test battery (nine tests) administered 6-8 weeks postoperatively with their preoperative scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During cardiopulmonary bypass, the median number and range of microemboli were 67 (5-846) and 55 (2-773) for the Avecor and AV-6 groups, respectively (p = 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in NP outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no difference in the filtering ability of vent-line and auto-vent filters as assessed by cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This, together with the similar NP outcome, suggests that both types of filter are equally safe for clinical use </plain></SENT>
