<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is a devastating complication in patients with prosthetic valves, but characterization of its late occurrence from a large cohort is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three thousand one hundred eighty-nine adult patients who underwent a total of 3,576 operations for left-heart valve replacement were managed with contemporary anticoagulation guidelines and prospectively followed in a dedicated clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total follow-up was 20,096 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bootstrapped survival analysis was used to determine the impact of patient and valve related factors on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were embolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linearized embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were 1.3% +/- 0.2% per year for aortic bioprostheses, 1.4% +/- 0.2% per year for aortic mechanical valves, 1.3% +/- 0.3% per year for mitral bioprostheses, and 2.3% +/- 0.4% per year for mitral mechanical valves (p = 0.002, vs other implant types) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age more than 75 years, female gender, and smoking were independent risk factors after aortic and mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo>, and tilting-disc mechanical prostheses were independent predictors of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was an independent risk factor in patients with mitral prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary operative indication, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, redo status, or the presence of two prosthetic valves were not associated with an increased hazard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> salicylic or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> anticoagulation did not significantly lower embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in patients with mechanical prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 20% of patients with valve prostheses have an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by 15 years after valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Some risk factors such as the avoidance of smoking, mitral mechanical prostheses, aortic tilting-disc valves, and proceeding to mitral surgery before LV dysfunction occurs are potentially modifiable </plain></SENT>
