<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>Patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) is considered as an important risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the relationship between the distribution of high-intensity transient signals (HITS), resulting from injection of air mixed with saline and detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD), and clinical cerebrovascular syndromes in these patients has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using TCD, we screened 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was proven by transesophageal echocariography (TEE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 30 patients (75%) with artificially produced HITS either in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) or the basilar artery (BA) were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in the carotid territory and 11 patients in the vertebro-basilar territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HITS were found in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 patients and in 21 of the 30 patients in the BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the latter, ten patients were in the carotid group and 11 patients were in the veretebro-basilar group, p = 0.011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between the distribution of artificial HITS and the clinical cerebrovascular syndromes </plain></SENT>
