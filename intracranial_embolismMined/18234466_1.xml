<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This prospective, randomized, single-center, open-label pilot study evaluated the safety and efficacy in carotid surgery of a single intraoperative bolus of body weight-adjusted enoxaparin compared with unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high-grade internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was to evaluate perioperative efficacy (incidence of thromboembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The secondary objective was to evaluate safety, including avoidance of <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> at the site of surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo>, rate of blood transfusions, and occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From July 2005 to June 2006, 338 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were enrolled; of these, 115 patients did not fulfill inclusion criteria, and 63 patients refused to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 160 patients were assigned in a 3:1 randomization to receive enoxaparin (0.5 mg/kg) or unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (5000 IU) intraoperatively as an intravenous bolus (120 and 40 patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age was 70.3 years (range, 43.3-94.7 years), and 54 were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was asymptomatic in 55% and symptomatic in 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in baseline characteristics between these groups was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of cerebral embolic events was 0.8% in the enoxaparin group (n = 1) and 2.5% in the unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications was 1.7% in the enoxaparin group (n = 2) and 5% in the unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group (n = 2; P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This pilot study found no difference between enoxaparin and unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during carotid endarterectomy in perioperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A large multicenter trial seems to be warranted </plain></SENT>
