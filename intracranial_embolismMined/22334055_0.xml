<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 36 consecutive patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery atherosclerotic stenosis underwent <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> monitoring by transcranial color Doppler and 3-T HR MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proton density-weighted cross-sectional images with submillimeter voxel size were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remodeling patterns and plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the sites of maximal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing were analyzed in terms of their association with the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive remodeling (PR) was found in 16 lesions (44·4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remodeling index was 1·11±0·05 in the PR group and 0·99±0·05 in the non-PR group (P&lt;0·0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the non-PR group, the PR group had a greater vessel area (19·97±1·42 mm(2) versus 18·23±1·23 mm(2)) and greater wall area (16·93±1·47 mm(2) versus 14·93±1·52 mm(2); both P&lt;0·0001) at the sites of maximal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, MESs were observed more frequently in the PR group than in the non-PR group (62·5% versus 15·0%, P = 0·003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery atherosclerotic stenosis, MESs were observed more frequently in the PR group than in the non-PR group </plain></SENT>
