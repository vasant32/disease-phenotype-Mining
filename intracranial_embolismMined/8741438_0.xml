<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 24 (63%) patients were successfully cured by operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of the 8 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> who underwent emergency operation died of low cardiac output syndrome and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> early postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the 6 patients with late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> had preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and died of multiple organ failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of them had annular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 6 patients with annular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, 3 patients who had Staphylococcus epidermidis and <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram negative</z:mp> bacterium as a causative microorganism had a short duration within 4 weeks from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two died suddenly in the long-term period after surgery because of prosthetic valve detachment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second operation were required for other 4 patients because of prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or perivalvular leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of them were lost from low cardiac output syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that delayed surgical intervention may be a major causative factor resulting in high surgical mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients with active native infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, an early aggressive operation should be considered prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and the destruction of the annulus </plain></SENT>
