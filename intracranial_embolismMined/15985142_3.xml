<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) have an undefined but certainly considerable risk of repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Especially, if a cerebrovascular event has already occurred and the combination with an atrial septum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) is present this risk increases tremendously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to demonstrate that surgical closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in combination with an <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> is safe and useful in preventing recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, proven by CT or MRI, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in combination with an <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> were prospectively scheduled for surgical closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with extracardiac sources of embolic disease were excluded from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, one patient suffered from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients (mean age 35.5 +/- 19.1 years) underwent direct suture of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and plication of the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest (n = 3) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean operation time was 123.1 +/- 20.2 minutes; mean bypass time was 34.5 +/- 9.9 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no mortality or significant postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean hospital stay was 5.1 +/- 1.5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up of &gt;4 years, no recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> occurred and no patient received anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that surgical closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in combination with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is safe and efficacious to prevent recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and avoids lifelong anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
