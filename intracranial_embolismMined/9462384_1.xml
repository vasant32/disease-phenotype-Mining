<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The number and nature of microemboli detected during the first 75 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed with TCD monitoring during 1992-1993 (group 1) were compared with those in a similar series of 75 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy in 1995 (group 2), after substantial experience (210 patients) with TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emboli were classified as either particulate or gaseous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with evidence of particulate emboli during the dissection phase of the operation, the total number of particulate emboli fell significantly in patients in group 2 (P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in patients in whom microembolization was detected on immediate opening of the shunt, the total number of microemboli also fell significantly in group 2 (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the median (95 per cent confidence interval) number of particulate emboli detected during the entire procedure fell significantly from 21 (16-29) in group 1 to 9 (7-14) in group 2 (P = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD monitoring plays an important role in the training and quality control of carotid endarterectomy and helps significantly to reduce the amount of microembolization </plain></SENT>
