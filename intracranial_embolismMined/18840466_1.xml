<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral embolization models have been hindered by the fact that delivery is predominantly one-sided and cannot be quantified easily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed a model for bilateral cerebral micro-embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49648">holmium</z:chebi> microspheres, it is possible to quantify intracerebral delivery using MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To validate the quantification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49648">holmium</z:chebi> microspheres a phantom study was performed in which concentration of microspheres in solution was compared with the number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49648">holmium</z:chebi>-induced artifacts on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After that identical microspheres were administered by unilateral injection in the carotid artery, while the opposite carotid artery was clamped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On post-injection MRI scans, intracerebral delivery and right/left distribution of the microspheres was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the phantom study it was shown that quantification by MRI is possible and that MRI artifacts represent single microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the rat brain, about one-third of the injected dose was consistently located on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The administration was reproducible regarding distribution and number of microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49648">holmium</z:chebi> microspheres enables quantification of delivered dose as single microspheres induce artifacts on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By clamping the contralateral carotid artery, one-third of the dose is diverted to the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
