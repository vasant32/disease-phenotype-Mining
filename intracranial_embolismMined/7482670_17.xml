<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has remained unclear whether cerebral microembolism also indicates a higher risk of future cerebral or <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF REPORT: Sixty-four asymptomatic patients with unilateral 70% to 90% internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were investigated prospectively (mean follow-up, 72 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients developed ischemic symptoms attributable to the stenosis (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, 2 patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A microembolic rate of &gt; or = 2 per hour in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery was associated with a substantially increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the corresponding carotid territory (odds ratio, 31; 95% confidence interval, 3 to 302; P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This prospective pilot study suggests that cerebral microembolism detected with transcranial Doppler sonography may define a high-risk subgroup among patients with asymptomatic high-grade internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
