<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each of the 15 independent cases studied, subjective utility values were obtained directly from the patients before the treatment decisions were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optimal decision based on the utility values was then calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The actual treatment decisions were made without any input or influence by this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were obtained at two large public hospitals and two privately owned multi-service hospitals in Kobe, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Active participation by patients in treatment decision making seems particularly useful when two or more treatments are approximately equivalent in terms of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A careful assessment of an individual patient's utilities can help the patient choose a treatment option meeting individual goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient autonomy must be strengthened by giving the patients realistic and unbiased information of the alternatives available and the possible outcomes </plain></SENT>
