<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aside from anecdotal reports, there are few data on the risk of thrombotic complications in patients in whom use of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and aspirin is discontinued perioperatively for cutaneous operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to present a large case series of thrombotic complications resulting from this practice and to estimate the incidence of these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 504 members of the American College of Mohs Micrographic Surgery and Cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> were surveyed regarding thrombotic complications when blood thinners were withheld perioperatively to ascertain the frequency of these complications and to describe associated morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 168 responding physicians reported 46 patients who experienced thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 54% (25 of 46) experienced the event when <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was withheld and 39% (18 of 46) when aspirin use was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic events included 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 3 cerebral emboli, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>, 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, 3 deep venous thromboses, 2 pulmonary emboli, and 1 retinal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calculation of incidence yielded an estimated thrombotic risk of 1 event per 12,816 operations, 1 in 6219 operations when use of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was discontinued and 1 in 21,448 when aspirin was withheld </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With no documented increase in severe hemorrhagic complications during continued use perioperatively of blood thinners, these data provide a compelling argument to maintain patients on medically necessary blood thinners during cutaneous operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> relevant clinical facts must be weighed when making this decision </plain></SENT>
