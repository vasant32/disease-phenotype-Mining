<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that peripheral administration of GPE prevents neuronal injury after ischemic reperfusion injury in young adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the ameliorating effects of GPE-treatment after embolic injury induced by microsphere injection in young adult and aged male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unilateral injury was induced by injecting microspheres into the right internal carotid artery in both young adult (3-4 months) and aged (16-17 months) male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Either GPE (12mg/kg) or the vehicle was infused intravenously over 1h starting 3h after embolic injury and the degree of brain injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> and vascular remodeling were examined using histological and immunohistochemical analysis 8 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in core temperature, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, oxygen saturation and heart rate were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microsphere injection induced multiple sites of focal damage in the ipsilateral subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Massive numbers of microglia accumulated within the core of the tissue damage whereas astrocytes were located in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the degree of brain injury between the young and aged control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However the aged rats showed less injury-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> and greater vascular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion of GPE 3h after the injury reduced overall damage scores in both young (p&lt;0.01) and aged rats (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GPE-treatment reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> in young, but not aged animals and did not significantly alter the vascular remodeling in either age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data suggested that the neuroprotection of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47923">tripeptide</z:chebi> is independent of cerebral reperfusion and is not age selective </plain></SENT>
