<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims here were to quantify this risk and determine the most efficient monitoring protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sequential patients undergoing CEA (enrolled in a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of peri-operative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> therapy) had 30-min TCD monitoring in the first post-operative hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>30-min monitoring was also performed 2-3, 4-6 and 24-36 h post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First post-operative hour ES counts were correlated with peri-operative ipsilateral carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> to determine the size of a clinically significant ES load and the magnitude of the associated risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exact Cochran-Armitage test for trend in proportions was used to determine when a clinically significant ES load was first detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 141 patients (mean age 69.3 years, 72% male) were monitored during the first post-operative hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An ES count &gt;10 per recording was identified as the best overall predictor of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (sensitivity 72%, specificity 89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3/119 (2.5%) patients with 0-10 ES had ipsilateral carotid events compared to 8/22 (36.4%) patients with 11-115 ES (OR = 22.1, 95% CI 4.5, 138.4, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>13/18 (72%) of subjects with &gt;10 ES were identified in the first post-operative hour with no significant increase in the number of new cases over the subsequent 24-36 post-operative h (p = 0.354) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with clinically significant post-operative microembolism had an approximately 15 times higher risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and most were identified during a 30-min study in the first post-operative hour </plain></SENT>
