<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The examination protocol included serial (before and at one, five, 90 and 180 days after surgery) monitoring sessions with transcranial Doppler and detailed neurological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monitoring was performed bilaterally over the middle cerebral arteries for one hour per session using 2 MHz probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals were recognized according to standard criteria and stored on a computer for later evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HITS prevalence increased from 3% preoperatively to 41% on the first postoperative day and remained unchanged during the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No influence of the intensity of anticoagulation or valve type on HITS counts was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unilateral monitoring provided adequate results in 83.9% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The causative role of the valve implant in the pathogenesis of HITS appears certain, since their prevalence dramatically increases following valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Valve type, duration of valve implant or intensity of anticoagulation did not influence HITS counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bilateral monitoring is warranted for accurate evaluation of HITS counts in this patient group </plain></SENT>
