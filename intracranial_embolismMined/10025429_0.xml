<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective case study in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Inpatient neurologic service in a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Serial TCD examinations were performed in 18 consecutive patients with CVT (14 females, 4 males) aged 16 to 64 years (mean+/-SD, 36.8+/-13.1 years) during a mean follow-up ranging from 34 to 783 days (mean+/-SD, 201+/-185 days) between 1993 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous TCD was performed with a 2-MHz range-gated transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Venous blood flow velocities were successfully measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest measured velocities in the monitored intracranial venous vessels ranged from 20 to 150 cm/s (mean+/-SD, 58.9+/-38.8 cm/s), and the lowest were from 9 to 84 cm/s (mean+/-SD, 27.9+/-17.0 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (83%) showed a decrease of velocities-2 of them after a transient increase during cessation of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of velocity decrease ranged from 34% to 73% (mean+/-SD, 56.4%+/-10.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A plateau phase, defined as no further decrease in velocities, was reached in these patients within 4 to 314 days (mean+/-SD, 59.9+/-73.7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients (17%) showed no changes in velocities as defined by a limit of velocity variation of 30% during the course of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High venous velocities were significantly associated with altered consciousness (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A nonsignificant relationship was observed with affliction of the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No correlations were noted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease, initial motor deficits, and presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No predictive value was gained from analyzing the outcome in relation to absolute velocities or their decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serial TCD studies allow monitoring of venous hemodynamics and collateral pathways in patients with CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> venous velocities in serial measurements, however, do not exclude a diagnosis of CVT </plain></SENT>
