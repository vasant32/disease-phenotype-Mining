<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, post-procedural neurological complications still occur in 0.5-10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing PVI, presumably due to embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of cerebral micro-embolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) as a surrogate marker for the risk of neurological impairment of two different PVI methods: (1) percutaneous endocardial radio-frequency (RF) ablation and (2) thoracoscopic epicardial ablation using RF energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients (eight persistent AF and two paroxysmal AF) underwent a minimally invasive thoracoscopic epicardial (EPI) RF ablation and 10 patients (one persistent AF and nine paroxysmal AF) underwent a percutaneous endocardial (ENDO) isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was used to detect an <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An average of 5 (+/-6) <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected during epicardial PVI procedure versus 3908 (+/-2816) <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during percutaneous endocardial PVI procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the ablation application period, respectively, 1 (+/-1) and 2566 (+/-2296) cerebral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral micro-emboli during epicardial ablation are almost absent when compared to the thousands of emboli measured during percutaneous endocardial ablation </plain></SENT>
