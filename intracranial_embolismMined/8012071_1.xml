<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonic imaging showed that the carotid artery was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography did not reveal a cardiac embolic source in either case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one patient, we observed that an atherosclerotic plaque became ulcerated and developed mobile projections over the course of a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More consideration should be given to the thoracic aorta as a source of embolism in patients with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
