<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An experimental model that induces sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and infarction may provide useful information relevant to prevention of the development of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the pathophysiological consequences of cerebral blood flow under sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> or oligemia and infarction in rats after microsphere embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We injected 900 microspheres (48 microns in diameter) into the right internal carotid artery of 146 rats and determined the time course of changes in blood flow of the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of both hemispheres by the hydrogen clearance method for a period of 28 days after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> area was determined by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cortical and striatal blood flow of the right hemisphere of microsphere-injected rats was significantly decreased after the embolism, and this was sustained throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal blood flow of the microsphere-injected hemisphere was also decreased on days 1 and 3 but tended to return toward control levels thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the left hemisphere, reduction in regional blood flow was detected in the cortex and hippocampus on day 1 and the striatum on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-unstained area had developed by day 3 after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extent of the area was similar to that on days 7 and 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination revealed degenerative areas scattered mainly in the parietotemporal cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, thalamus, and lenticular nucleus of the embolized hemisphere, demonstrating the induction of widespread <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> after embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microsphere embolism resulted in a sustained decrease in regional blood flow and production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the brain regions of the microsphere-injected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
