<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the effects of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and 21- amino steroid (U74006F) in experimental embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The size of infarction from embolism was compared to controls with tPA alone, 21-amino steroid alone, and in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery of the rabbit was embolized by injecting an arterial ('white') <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rabbit treatment was 2 mg kg-1 of tissue-type plasminogen activator and/or 3 mg kg-1 of 21 amino steroid started at 2 h post-embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were terminated 4 h post-treatment and brains were examined for evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of tissue-type plasminogen activator and/or 21-amino steroid in the raw data show that there is a tendency for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatments to reduce the ischemic volume when compared to the control group, also it is evident the standard deviation of these estimates is rather large when compared to the differences between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of the analysis of variance shows that the differences expressed are not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(No statistical differences were found between the treatment groups and the control group.) The results show that administration of tissue-type plasminogen activator and/or 21 amino steroid at 2 h post-embolization alone or in simultaneous administration does not significantly reduce the volume of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies need to be addressed in regards to the region of viable brain in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, in reducing the time to treatment </plain></SENT>
