<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case in which a 45-year-old man supported by a HeartMate(R) XVE left ventricular assist device required a pump exchange due to failure of the device motor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During pump dissection, a massive amount of air entered the systemic circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urgent cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass was performed, and cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated, followed by profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, retrograde cerebral perfusion, retrograde coronary sinus perfusion, and then <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HeartMate XVE left ventricular assist device was removed, and a HeartMate II was implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 5 days, the patient awoke with left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, which nearly resolved with aggressive physical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-four days after the pump exchange operation, the patient was discharged from the hospital with only mild left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure of the left ventricular assist device or its external components requires careful monitoring, because air can enter the pump-particularly in a hypovolemic patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rapid response after massive air entry into the left ventricular assist device system, as in our patient, can result in a successful outcome </plain></SENT>
