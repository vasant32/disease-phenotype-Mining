<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report a case of cerebral gas embolism secondary to the withdrawal of a central venous line in a patient who had recently undergone abdominal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: An 82-year-old male who suddenly presented myoclonias in the right upper extremity and a sharp drop in the level of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A computerised tomography (CT) scan revealed air bubbles in the intracranial circulatory system and associated infarction in the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's clinical progression was poor and he died some days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral gas embolism can be diagnosed using a CT scan of the head if it is performed immediately after the entrance of air into the bloodstream inside the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In later phases, findings are unspecific and difficult to distinguish from ischaemic infarction or from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006994'>diffuse leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment is based on supportive measures and, in some cases, hyperbaric oxygen, although their true effectiveness is a controversial issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral gas embolism is a potentially fatal and avoidable complication in patients with a central venous line or other iatrogenic procedures that can allow air to enter the arterial or venous circulatory systems </plain></SENT>
