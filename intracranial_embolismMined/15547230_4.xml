<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It is well known that radiofrequency ablation generates microbubbles in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that microbubbles generated during percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo> flow into the pulmonary veins and are distributed to the systemic arteries, as with radiofrequency ablation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> during radiofrequency ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo>, we performed diffusion-weighted imaging and, if possible, monitored microemboli in the carotid artery during radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 20 patients (19 men and one woman) who underwent radiofrequency ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative MRI examinations were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 patients, and during 17 radiofrequency ablation sessions, sonography was used to monitor whether microemboli were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Radiofrequency ablation was technically feasible for the treatment of selected pulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microemboli, which were believed to represent microbubbles, were seen on sonography during three of the 17 radiofrequency ablation sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were rarely observed when a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> was small, the treatment session was brief, and the radiofrequency emission power was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No new area of abnormal intensity was seen on postoperative MRI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the microemboli were observed, MRI could not confirm infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We concluded that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> as a result of microbubbles generated during radiofrequency ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo> has a low possibility of becoming a clinical problem </plain></SENT>
