<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its pathophysiology is poorly understood, and effective treatments are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present 5 patients with long-bone fractures in whom in vivo microembolism was detected by transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients with long-bone fractures were monitored with transcranial Doppler for microembolic signals (MESs) after trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients also had intraoperative monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A TC-2020 instrument equipped with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection software was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detected signals were saved for subsequent review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Selected signals satisfied criteria defined previously and were categorized as large or small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral microembolism was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients and was transient, resolving within 4 days of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative monitoring revealed an increase in MESs during intramedullary nail insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of MESs after injury varied among patients, with large signals being more frequent in the only patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral microembolism after long-bone fractures can be detected in vivo and monitored over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings may have potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
