<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two of the problems inherent in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> are the narrow therapeutic time window and the severe side effects of fibrinolytic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is necessary to develop a new method of removing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0936263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral thrombus</z:e> more rapidly and with smaller quantities of fibrinolytics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The behaviour of a bubble formed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49648">holmium</z:chebi> (Ho):YAG laser irradiation in a capillary tube filled with pure water was observed at various stand-off distances (L; distance between the end of optical fibre and the capillary exit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a liquid-jet generator was created by insertion of an optical fibre (core diameter: 0.6 mm) into a catheter (6 Fr) filled with pure water, and a pulsed Ho:YAG laser (pulse duration time=350 micros, laser energy=230 mJ/pulse) was used to irradiate the optical fibre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum penetration depth, into a gelatin artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, of a liquid jet generated with this device was measured for various stand-off distances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the phenomenon and the pressure around the catheter exit were captured via shadowgraph and PVDF needle hydrophone, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The laser-induced bubble in the capillary tube grew rapidly in the direction of propagation and generated a liquid jet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximum penetration depth of this liquid jet into an artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> increased in proportion to L and reached a maximum value (9 mm) when L was around 13 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A shock wave whose overpressure at a point 4 mm away from the catheter exit exceeded 12 MPa was captured by shadowgraph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that Ho:YAG laser irradiation within a water-filled catheter caused liquid jet formation, which could penetrate straight into an artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, this jet is expected to promote fibrinolysis by means of injecting fibrinolytics deeply into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After resolving some problems, this system will be applied to an endovascular therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> in the near future </plain></SENT>
