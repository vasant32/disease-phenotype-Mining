<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were treated with rt-PA at 1 (n = 9) or 4 (n = 7) hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or were untreated (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and T2-weighted imaging were performed before and after embolization from 1 hour to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were detected in the relative areas with low cerebral blood flow (CBF), apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCw), and T2 between the 4-hour treated group and the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant decreases in the average relative areas with low CBF were detected in the 1-hour treated group from 4 to 48 hours after embolization as compared with the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in T2 in the 1-hour treated group was significantly lower than in the untreated and 4-hour treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in ADCw was detected in the 1-hour treated group at 3 and 24 hours after embolization as compared with the untreated and 4-hour treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary embolization was detected by both MRI and laser scanning confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that MRI can detect the efficacy of rt-PA treatment and secondary ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
