<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To characterize whether autophagic elements are associated with the nitrosative stress that causes endothelial damage after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> injury, an in vitro sustained oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) and an in vivo microsphere embolism model were used in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with OGD-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formation, a rapid induction of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I/II conversion and green fluorescent protein-LC3 puncta accumulation were observed in endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Western blot analyses indicated that OGD induced elevations in lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 and cathepsin B protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed in the microvessel insult model, following occlusion of the microvessels using microsphere injections in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cultured endothelial cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> (1-50 Î¼m) exhibited a concentration-dependent change in the pattern of autophagy-lysosome signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, OGD-induced autophagy-lysosome processes were attenuated by PEP-19 overexpression and by a small-interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of eNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The importance of nitrosative stress in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced autophagy-lysosome cascades is further supported by our finding that pharmacological inhibition of nitrosative stress by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> partially inhibits the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced autophagy-lysosome cascade and the degradation of the tight junction proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the present results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>-mediated nitrosative stress at least partially potentiates autophagy-lysosome signaling during sustained ischemic insult-induced endothelial cell damage </plain></SENT>
