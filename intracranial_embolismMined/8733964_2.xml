<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the usefulness of transcranial color-coded real-time sonography in detecting occlusion of the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using transcranial color-coded real-time sonography, we measured the end-diastolic flow velocity with incident angle correction and the side-to-side ratio of the end-diastolic flow velocity (the end-diastolic ratio) in both middle cerebral arteries in 44 patients with or without occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before or within 1 week after sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects included 4 patients with unilateral stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery &gt; or = 75%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> group), 6 with unilateral occlusion of the extracranial internal carotid (ICO group), 6 with occlusion of the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery (M1 group), and 28 without stenotic (&lt; 75%) lesions in the internal carotid artery (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control group, the end-diastolic flow velocity was 40.4 +/- 16.8 cm/s (mean +/- SD) and the end-diastolic ratio was 1.28 +/- 0.27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> and ICO groups, the end-diastolic flow velocities on the affected side and the end-diastolic ratios were 33.4 +/- 9.0 cm/s and 1.35 +/- 0.24, and 29.6 +/- 10.2 cm/s and 1.67 +/- 0.58, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the M1 group, the end-diastolic flow velocity (16.7 +/- 4.29 cm/s) on the occluded side was significantly lower than that in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The end-diastolic ratio (3.53 +/- 1.47) in the M1 group was significantly higher than that in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The M1 group could be easily distinguished from the other groups on the basis of the end-diastolic ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the end-diastolic flow velocity and the end-diastolic ratios in the middle cerebral artery by means of transcranial color-coded real-time sonography may help to identify an occlusion in the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
