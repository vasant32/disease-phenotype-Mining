<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We report a preclinical study of a new endoluminal device for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion to test the hypothesis that the device, even without use of intrasaccular coil placement, could occlude saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> without causing substantial parent artery compromise or compromise of adjacent, small branch arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Pipeline Neuroendovascular Device (Pipeline NED; Chestnut Medical Technologies, Inc) is a braided, tubular, bimetallic endoluminal implant aimed at occlusion of saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> through flow disruption along the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The device was implanted across the necks of 17 elastase-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the New Zealand white rabbit model and followed for 1 month (n=6), 3 months (n=5), and 6 months (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each subject, a second device was implanted in the abdominal aorta to cover the origins of lumbar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion rates by angiography (grade 1, complete occlusion; grade 2, near-complete occlusion; and grade 3, incomplete occlusion) were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percent area stenosis of the parent arteries was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presence of distal emboli in the downstream vessels in the parent artery and branch <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Grades 1, 2, and 3 occlusion rates were noted in 9 (53%), 6 (35%), and 2 (12%) of 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, respectively, indicating an 88% rate of complete or near complete occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No cases of branch <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or distal emboli in the downstream vessels of the parent artery, specifically the subclavian artery, were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Parent artery compromise from neointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was minimal in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Pipeline NED is a trackable, bio- and hemocompatible device able to occlude saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with preservation of the parent artery and small, adjacent branch vessels </plain></SENT>
