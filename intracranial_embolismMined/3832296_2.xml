<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been accepted that transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> (TMB) is highly suggestive of an ipsilateral carotid artery lesion in patients with arterial risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We confirmed this in 55 patients, who had an internal carotid artery severe stenosis, occlusion or ulceration on angiography in more than 50 per cent of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, 12-lead-ECG, 2 D--echocardiography and Holter monitoring also showed a potential cardiac source of emboli in 22 per cent of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients (83 per cent) also had an appropriate arterial lesion, and the exact cause of the episodes of TMB remained undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that every fourth of fifth patient with TMB may have a potential cardiac source of emboli, the detection of which could alter the management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systematic non-invasive cardiac investigations are warranted, especially in TMB patients with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
