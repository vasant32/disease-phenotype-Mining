<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 26-year-old woman came to hospital with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> abdomen and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> for about 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She showed signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> and underwent a laparotomy after initial diagnostic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was massive terminal <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resection of the affected bowel was performed over 5 1/2 h without surgical or <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively several attempts were made to insert a venous catheter via the internal jugular vein, first on the right and then on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The catheter was finally placed and was used for infusions, although there were some signs that indicated a possible arterial position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological disturbances followed the end of anesthesia; 2 h later the catheter was removed because of arterial malpositioning diagnosed by a blood gas analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient developed brainstem and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> and died 2 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main postmortem finding was massive swelling and paleness of the cerebellum and brainstem with macroscopically unaffected supporting arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other main arteries of the head and neck were also unremarkable, except for two healing punctures of the left common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further examination revealed an embolism at the top of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The source was macroscopically obscure; stereomicroscopic examination of the heart showed small dark spots behind one fold of the aortic valve caused by parietal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the damaged endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The tip of the misplaced catheter had entered this region and caused the lethal embolism </plain></SENT>
