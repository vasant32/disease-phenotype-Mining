<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 794 women in Denmark aged 15-44 who had suffered a cerebral thromboembolic attack (CTA) during the period 1985-1989, and an age-matched randomly selected control population of 1588 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CTA included occlusion of precerebral arteria (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 432), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 433), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 434), transitory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> (TCI; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 435) and the unspecified group apoplexia cerebri (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 436) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 692/1584 case/control questionnaires sent out, 590/1396 (85.1/88.1%) were returned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the cases, 15 refused to participate, 69 had a revised or unreliable diagnosis, 40 had previously had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo>, 13 were pregnant, and 152 had a disease predisposing them for CTA, leaving 323 without known predisposition, of whom 320 reported use/non-use of OC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 1396 controls, eight either refused to participate, were mentally retarded or resident in foreign countries; 18 returned an uncompleted questionnaire, 17 had previously had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo>, 31 were pregnant, and 130 had a disease predisposing them to CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, 1198 non-predisposed controls were provided, among whom 1197 reported use/non-use of OC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 320 cases, 116 (36.3%) were OC users at the time of the CTA, vs. 191 users (16.0%) among 1197 controls, corresponding to a crude odds ratio (OR) of 3.00.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
