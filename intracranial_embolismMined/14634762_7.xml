<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the brains of 262 such patients operated for coronary bypass, valve replacement, or heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circulatory disturbances (macro- and microhemorrhages, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo>, and hypoxemic brain damage) were present in 128 cases (49%), as the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 33 cases (12.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were caused by local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> of brain arteries, arterial emboli originating from the operative sites or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>, or by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e>, foreign body emboli or megakaryocytic capillary emboli in rare cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory disturbances were present in 17 cases and consisted of fungal or <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> septicopyemic changes (12) or of glial nodules (5) as the substrate of a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> or autoimmunencephalitis (Bickerstaff) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An incidental finding was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> in 37 cases (14% of the material) of elderly patients, often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> but not as cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or cause of macroscopic brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since we have conducted an autopsy study, there is a limitation to transfer the documented changes to the total group of post-cardiac surgery patients with neurologic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrary to some previous reports, histologically overt microembolic phenomena do not seem to play a major role in our material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, careful scrutiny revealed non-fatal white matter microhemorrhages of varying frequency in the different groups, especially after valve operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These as well as the occasional glial nodules, after resorption and microscarring, could well be the cause of slight neurologic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
