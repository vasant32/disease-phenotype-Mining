<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to validate a biobank of human carotid endarterectomies as a platform for further exploration of pathways for plaque instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we investigated the relationship between clinical parameters of plaque instability and expression of genes previously shown to be associated with either plaque instability or healing processes in the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A database of clinical information and gene-expression microarray data from 106 carotid endarterectomies were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-7 was 100-fold higher in plaques than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general, genes associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (such as RANKL and CD68) were overexpressed in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plaques obtained from patients undergoing surgery within 2 weeks after an embolic event showed up-regulation of genes involved in healing reactions in the vessel wall (including elastin and collagen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> treatment, as well as echodense lesions, were associated with a more stable phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Here, we demonstrate that gene-expression profiles reflect clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that microarray technology and clinical variables can be used for the future identification of central molecular pathways in plaque instability </plain></SENT>
