<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome is a rare, but potentially lethal, complication of long bone fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological symptoms are variable, and the clinical diagnosis is difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this case study is to demonstrate the value of diffusion-weighted MRI of the brain for early diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case Description- A non-head-injured 18-year-old woman suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mental status changes 21 hours after an uncomplicated fracture of the left tibia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI of the brain was performed 48 hours after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted images showed multiple nonconfluent areas of high signal intensity, which, on the diffusion-weighted scans, were revealed as bright spots on a dark background ("starfield" pattern) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this indicates areas of restricted diffusion that are due to cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, resulting from multiple microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-intensity lesions in the brain on diffusion-weighted images may serve as an early-appearing and more sensitive indicator of the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> in the clinical context of long bone injury without head trauma </plain></SENT>
