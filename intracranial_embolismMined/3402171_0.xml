<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the neurologic symptoms some of the patients also had (transitoric ischemic attacks, embolism) left <z:mp ids='MP_0001855'>atrial thrombosis</z:mp> was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The echographic phenomenon of spontaneous left atrial contrast was further examined by magnetic resonance imaging in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the spin-echo-mode the multi-echo-imaging showed dense signals in the second echo and no or few left atrial signals in the first echo in 8/10 pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2/10 pts. there were no increased signals in left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The missing presence of the increased signals in the first echo excluded <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the left atrium and proved blood flow effects </plain></SENT>
