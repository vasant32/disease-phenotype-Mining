<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> affects 2% to 3% of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and is preceded by 1 to 2 hours of increasing cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous work has demonstrated that high rates of postoperative embolization are associated with increased platelet reactivity to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that preoperative administration of the platelet <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> could reduce postoperative embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred CEA patients on routine aspirin therapy (150 mg) were randomized to 75 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (n=46) or placebo (n=54) the night before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet response to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> was assessed by whole-blood flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of emboli detected by transcranial Doppler within 3 hours of CEA was independently quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time taken from flow restoration to skin closure was used as an indirect measure of the time to secure hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison with placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> produced a small (8.8%) but significant reduction in the platelet response to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05) while conferring a 10-fold reduction in the relative risk of those patients having &gt;20 emboli in the postoperative period (odds ratio, 10.23; 95% CI, 1.3 to 83.3; P=0.01, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>-treated patients, the time from flow restoration to skin closure (an indirect marker of hemostasis) was significantly increased (P=0.04, Fisher's exact test), although there was no increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications or blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that a CEA patient's postoperative thromboembolic potential can be significantly reduced by targeted preoperative antiplatelet therapy without increasing the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
