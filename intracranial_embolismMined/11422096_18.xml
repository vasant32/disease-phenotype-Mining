<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the precise mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is not known, risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> have been found in migraineurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin factor 1.2 (F1.2) is a cleavage product of prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevated plasma F1.2 has been shown to be a sensitive and a specific marker of ongoing thrombin generation, and thus may serve as an indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we determined plasma F1.2 levels in 35 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (22 with aura and 13 without aura) and in 24 healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated F1.2 levels were found in 11 of 22 (50%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> (1.25-3.5 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002083'>migraine without aura</z:hpo> nor any of the healthy volunteers had elevated plasma F1.2 levels (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> &lt; 1.1 nmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that prothrombin F1.2 levels are elevated in a significant number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> but not in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002083'>migraine without aura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that there is activation of the clotting system in certain patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
