<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hepatic portal venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is the rarest complication of gastrointestinal endoscopy, resulting from penetration of gas into the portal veins, and may occur during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The likely mechanism is intramural dissection of insufflated air into the portal venous system through duodenal vein radicles transected during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hepatic portal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> may be fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> may also occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>So far 13 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography have been reported, with 4 cases of systemic spread that proved fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> was due to pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> in 2 cases, and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> in another 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report on an additional such fatal case, concerning a 78-year-old male patient, who several years previously had undergone surgical gastroduodenal resection with cholecystectomy and papillotomy, and was admitted for recurrent ascending <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> secondary to bile duct stones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the third endoscopic cholangioscopic procedure for removal of bile duct stones, sudden cardiopulmonary arrest occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> was due to massive pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Autopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A spontaneous duodenobiliary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the basis of bench radiologic investigation (retrograde suprahepatic venography and anterograde portography), it was demonstrated that the air insufflated during duodenal endoscopy, which entered through the spontaneous duodeno-<z:mp ids='MP_0003322'>biliary fistula</z:mp>, penetrated into intrahepatic vein radicles injured secondarily to prolonged impaction of biliary sand and stones and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, resulting in portal and hepatic venous gas and systemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
