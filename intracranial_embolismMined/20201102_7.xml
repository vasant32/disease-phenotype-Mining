<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The multicenter EPIC (FiberNet Embolic Protection System in Carotid Artery Stenting Trial) single-arm trial evaluated the 30-day outcomes of a new design concept for embolic protection during carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Embolic protection filters available for use during CAS include fixed and over-the-wire systems that rely on embolic material capture within a "basket" structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FiberNet Embolic Protection System (EPS), which features a very low crossing profile, consists of a three-dimensional fiber-based filter distally mounted on a 0.014 inch guidewire with integrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> during filter retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The trial enrolled 237 patients from 26 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographics, clinical and lesion characteristics, as well as adverse events through a 30-day follow-up were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 74 years, 64% were male and 20% had symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combined major adverse event (MAE) rate at 30 days for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was 3.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were three major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (two ischemic and one hemorrhagic) and two minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (both ischemic) for a 2.1% 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The procedural technical success rate was 97.5% and macroscopic evidence of debris was reported in 90.9% of the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FiberNet EPS, used with commercially available stents, produced low <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates following CAS in high surgical risk patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The unique filter design including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> during retrieval may have contributed to the low 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate reported during CAS in patients considered at high risk for complications following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
