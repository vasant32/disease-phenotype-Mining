<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), there are well-defined periods of embolic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In theory, cerebral embolization might be reduced by an increase in pump flow during these periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the CPB flow-embolization relation in a canine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty mongrel dogs underwent CPB at 35 degrees C with alpha-stat management and a fentanyl-midazolam <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each animal, CPB flow was adjusted to achieve a mean arterial pressure of 65-75 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During CPB, an embolic load of 1.2 x 10(5) 67 microm fluorescent microspheres was injected into the arterial inflow line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before and after embolization, cerebral blood flow was determined using 15-microm microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissue was taken from 12 brain regions and microspheres were recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relation between pump flow and embolization/g of brain was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean arterial pressure at embolization was 67 +/-4 mmHg, and the range of pump flow was 0.9-3.5 l x min(-1)x m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was independent of pump flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At lower pump flow, the percentage of that flow delivered to the brain increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was a strong inverse relation between pump flow and cerebral embolization (r = -0.708, P &lt; 0.000 by Spearman rank order correlation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral embolization is determined by the CPB flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At an unchanged mean arterial pressure, as pump flow is reduced, a progressively greater proportion of that flow is delivered to the brain </plain></SENT>
