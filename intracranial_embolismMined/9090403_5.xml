<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: We reviewed the brain CT scans (n = 44), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images (n = 6), or both (n = 4), and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spinal study in 34 patients with Rocky Mountain spotted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, proved by definitive serologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Records were reviewed with attention to clinical symptoms and therapeutic modifications based on neuroimaging; outcomes were compared with imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abnormalities, consisting of infarctions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, meningeal enhancement, and prominent perivascular spaces, were found on four of 44 CT scans and on four of six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> study showed abnormal enhancement of the lower spinal cord and cauda <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017589" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">equina</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonspecific clinical symptoms were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom neuroimaging findings were abnormal and in 80% of patients whose CT and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment, return to baseline clinical status was documented in 67% of patients with abnormal imaging findings and in 93% with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 17% of patients with abnormal neuroimaging results and in none of those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities on neuroimaging studies were not common in patients with Rocky Mountain spotted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When present, they were subtle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptoms at presentation and unfavorable outcomes were more prevalent when CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities identified on neuroimaging studies did not alter clinical treatment in any patient </plain></SENT>
