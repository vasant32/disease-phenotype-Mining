<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Necropsy evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> also shows a high prevalence of severe atheroma in the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A further pathological finding is that obstruction in cerebral and carotid circulations is commonly due to embolism from the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, long-term follow-up of survivors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> indicates a low prevalence of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test if this low prevalence is due to lack of clinical ascertainment, a study was made of 260 survivors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> followed for five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific attention was given to eliciting any clinical manifestations of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study it was confirmed that in survivors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease is surprisingly low: completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> 4%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient cerebral ischaemic attacks</z:e> 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation of the low prevalence is that after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> attacks of cardiac dysrhythmia predisposing to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> become infrequent </plain></SENT>
