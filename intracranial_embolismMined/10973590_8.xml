<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and a novel computer software program, MIRAGE, we measured a reduction in cerebral microvessel diameter after 1 and 4 h of embolic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methodology used by MIRAGE for measurement of blood vessel diameter involves a linearly applied spherical inflation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional quantitative analysis revealed a significant (P&lt;0.05) mean 10-12% reduction in vessel diameter in the ipsilateral cortex when compared to the homologous region in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This reduction was seen only in the cortex and not the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A larger reduction in mean vessel diameter in the ipsilateral cortex, 16-30% (P&lt;0.05) was observed when compared to sham control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results are in strong agreement with other studies using different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models and imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our work represents a novel application of LSCM technology to the three dimensional investigation of microvessel diameter changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and identifies its potential as an important tool for investigation of cerebral pathology </plain></SENT>
