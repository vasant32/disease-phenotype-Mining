<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this trial was to contrast the incidence of subclinical cerebral embolization in high-risk patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS) with open-cell vs closed-cell stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During an 18-month period, 40 patients were randomized (1:1) to undergo CAS with open-cell (Acculink, n = 20) or closed-cell stents (Xact, n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single filter device for embolic protection (Accunet filter) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD)-detected microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) during CAS and preprocedural and 24-hour postprocedural diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) were used to determine cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and nonparametric analyses were used to assess associations between stent design and cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CAS was performed in 17 symptomatic patients (43%) and 23 asymptomatic patients (57%) with a similar number of open-cell and closed-cell stents (9/8 and 11/12, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total and poststenting median ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts detected by TCD were 264 (interquartile range [IQR], 222-343) and 48 (IQR, 41-66) for open-cell stents and 339 (IQR, 163-408) and 53 (IQR, 23-88) for closed-cell stents, respectively (P &gt; .56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> detected with DW-MRI occurred in 53% and 47% of patients undergoing CAS with open-cell and closed-cell stents, respectively (P = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total and ipsilateral median numbers of DW-MRI lesions between groups were not statistically significantly different (ie, 2 [IQR, 0-4] and 1 [IQR, 0-3] for open-cell stents and 1 [IQR, 0-3] and 1 [IQR, 0-2] for closed cell-stents, respectively; P &gt; .4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One asymptomatic patient undergoing CAS with an open-cell stent sustained a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; the 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate in this series was 2.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral embolization, as detected by TCD and DW-MRI, occurs with similar frequency after CAS with open-cell and closed-cell stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This randomized trial does not support the superiority of any stent design with respect to cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
