<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A simple and inexpensive technique is described for the assessment of regional cerebral blood volume (CBV) using a color reaction based on the pseudoperoxidase activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cryostat sections are placed on a commercially available reagent strip originally designed for quantitative estimation of blood content in urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After melting of the brain section, a blue color reaction appears which is darker in areas with higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The image is analyzed by a computerized image-processing system and evaluated by standards prepared from brain homogenate with different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the optical density data, regional CBV is calculated with correction for the difference between microvascular and large vessel hematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method was validated by a radiolabel procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Values of regional CBV are reported in gray matter areas of control rabbits and in brains embolized by autologous clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This simple inexpensive technique is a useful supplementary tool in multiparametric metabolic studies </plain></SENT>
