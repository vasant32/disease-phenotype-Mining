<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the capability of capturing and classification of gaseous emboli and pressure drop of three different membrane oxygenators (Sorin Apex, Terumo Capiox SX25, Maquet QUADROX) were measured in a simulated adult model of CPB using a novel ultrasound detection and classification quantifier system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The circuit was primed with 1000 mL heparinized human packed red blood cells and 1000 mL lactated Ringer's solution (total volume 2000 mL, corrected hematocrit 26-28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the injection of 5 mL air into the venous line, an Emboli Detection and Classification Quantifier was used to simultaneously record microemboli counts at post-pump, post-oxygenator, and post-arterial filter sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trials were conducted at normothermic (35 degrees C) and hypothermic (25 degrees C) conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-oxygenator and post-oxygenator pressure were recorded in real time and pressure drop was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maquet QUADROX membrane oxygenator has the lowest pressure drops compared to the other two oxygenators (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The comparison among the three oxygenators indicated better capability of capturing gaseous emboli with the Maquet QUADROX and Terumo Capiox SX25 membrane oxygenator and more emboli may pass through the Sorin Apex membrane oxygenator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microemboli counts uniformly increased with hypothermic perfusion (25 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Different types of oxygenators and reservoirs have different capability of capturing gaseous emboli and transmembrane pressure drop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on this investigation, Maquet QUADROX membrane oxygenator has the lowest pressure drop and better capability for capturing gaseous microemboli </plain></SENT>
