<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011119" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">decompression sickness</z:e> and is assumed to cause severe neurological dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A mathematical model previously developed to calculate embolism absorption time based on in vivo bubble geometry is used in which various conditions of hyperbaric therapy are considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects of varying external pressure and inert gas concentrations in the breathing mixtures, according to US Navy and Royal Navy diving treatment tables, are predicted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recompression alone is calculated to reduce absorption times of a 50-nl bubble by up to 98% over the untreated case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lowering the inhaled inert gas concentration from 67.5% to 50% reduces absorption time by 37% at a given pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bubbles formed after diving and decompression with He are calculated to absorb up to 73% faster than bubbles created after diving and decompression with air, regardless of the recompression gas breathed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This model is a useful alternative to impractical clinical trials in assessing which initial step in hyperbaric therapy is most effective in eliminating cerebral gas embolisms should they occur </plain></SENT>
