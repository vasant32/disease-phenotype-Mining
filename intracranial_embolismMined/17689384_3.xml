<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic embolism accounts for 15% to 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography is frequently being used as a screening test for sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the value of routine use of echocardiography for this task remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the diagnostic yield of echocardiography in unselected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, complemented by transesophageal echocardiography in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 807 echocardiographic examinations (743 transthoracic and 64 transesophageal) were performed in 775 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A potential cardiac source of embolism (CSE) was found in 144 (18%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent potential causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were more likely to have impact on therapeutic decisions in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Numbers needed to test for detection of CSE increased 10-fold from 6 in patients younger than 50 years to 62 in patients aged 70 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Echocardiography may provide important information on the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, echocardiographic screening for a CSE is not warranted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with younger than 50 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, echocardiography has a higher diagnostic yield and should routinely be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In older patients routine echocardiography results in a high rate of unspecific findings, and should be applied selectively, targeted at specific clinical questions </plain></SENT>
