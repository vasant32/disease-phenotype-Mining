<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1, 1970, through Dec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>31, 1974, and has confirmed the continuing decline in the incidence rate previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decline in the rate has been accelerating, with a relatively greater reduction occurring in women and in the more elderly age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There has been a decline in the prevalence rate in women which was not seen in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The over-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was to reduce the proportion of those persons who were completely independent from 57% before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> to 16% after infarction </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reason for the declining incidence and increased survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in this population has not been established, but evidence of increased community surveillance and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> among persons before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> is presented </plain></SENT>
