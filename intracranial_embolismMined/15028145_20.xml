<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, a common finding after traumatic brain injury (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed samples of the frontal cortex and hippocampus from individuals who had sustained a fatal TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sections stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin were reviewed and rated for severity of selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (SNN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because intravascular fibrin microthrombi may lyse within a few days of TBI, we restricted our analysis to patients who had died within 48 hours of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical records in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were reviewed to rule out severe or prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> or hypoxemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with severe or global SNN were compared with 11 patients in whom SNN was mild or absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Slides adjacent to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin sections were stained with an immunofluorescent antibody to antithrombin III and were reviewed for intravascular microthrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of microthrombi on each slide was counted by an investigator blinded to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin findings, and density of intravascular microthrombi was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intravascular microthrombi were noted in every section, excluding control (non-TBI) brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the density of microthrombi varied with the degree of SNN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found a highly significant difference in the mean density of microthrombi between patients with severe SNN (7.74 +/- 3.7/cm(2)) and those with little or no SNN (2.58 +/- 1.0/cm(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a good correlation was noted between the location of intravascular microthrombi and that of SNN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support a strong link between intravascular microthrombosis and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after brain trauma in humans and may have important implications for new therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
