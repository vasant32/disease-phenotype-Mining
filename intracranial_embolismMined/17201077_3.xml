<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of two different extracorporeal circuits on the counts of high-intensity transient signals (HITS) during pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler was used to detect HITS associated with extracorporeal sources during the period of aortic crossclamping in the middle cerebral artery of children undergoing CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on body size, children were assigned one of two extracorporeal circuits (A or B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circuit A included a D-705 oxygenator and associated reservoir, and circuit B included a Lilliput oxygenator and reservoir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were further classified into two groups according to the complexity of surgical repair: single simple lesions or multiple complex lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 109 pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgery for multiple complex lesions was associated with longer periods of aortic crossclamping and CPB (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median count of extracorporeal HITS was 12 (25th, 75th percentiles: 3, 51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The type of extracorporeal circuit (p = 0.012) and the complexity of surgical repair (p &lt; 0.0001) had an effect on the HITS counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of circuit A was associated with higher HITS counts during surgery for multiple complex lesions compared to single simple lesions (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, no differences were found with the use of circuit B between these two surgical groups (p &gt; 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During surgery for multiple complex lesions, patients treated with circuit A showed higher HITS counts than those with circuit B (p &lt; 0.01), but there were no circuit-related differences in HITS counts (p = 0.30) during single simple lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Variations in the design characteristics of extracorporeal circuits can increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> during CPB in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may be related to the reduced ability of some circuits to remove emboli during long periods of CPB for complex congenital heart-surgery </plain></SENT>
