<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil activation and accumulation as a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion has been suggested to exacerbate tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study is designed to examine the effect of IB4, a monoclonal antibody directed against the neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> protein, CD18, in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New Zealand rabbits (3-3.5 kg n=8 each group), were given an autologous clot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, delivered to the anterior circulation of the brain via the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, the mean arterial pressure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals was reduced to 30 mmHg by controlled exsanguination for a period of 45 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were mechanically ventilated and following parameters were monitored hourly: arterial blood gases, intracranial pressure, regional cerebral blood flow, hematocrit, and core temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rabbits were given either IB4 (1 mg kg(-1)), or vehicle (1 percent albumin, IV) 30 min following the thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean arterial pressure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals was restored to the baseline value of 50-60 mmHg for the remainder of the 4-h experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following the thromboembolic event, the intracranial pressure rose in both groups, although this was significantly less in the IB4-treated group, with the final values being 195.9 +/- 38.3 vs. 135.5 +/- 26.0 percent of baseline (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, regional cerebral blood flow and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (TTC staining) were virtually identical in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that blockade of the neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> protein, CD18, may contribute to a reduction in the intracranial pressure following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion, providing further evidence that activated neutrophils may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
