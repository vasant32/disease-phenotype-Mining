<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In patients with thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the occluded artery often reopens over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This results through a natural dissolution of the occluding material, and fragments of the material may move downstream to obstruct distal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study was undertaken to investigate the patency of brain microvessels at varying time intervals after injection of a preformed clot into the right internal carotid artery of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microvessels in brain sections were visualized using immunohistochemistry for fibronectin (detecting existing microvessels) and Evans blue (visualizing perfused microvessels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patent microvessels was calculated as the number of Evans blue-positive microvessels divided by the number of fibronectin-positive microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control animals, results showed that 98% +/- 3% (mean +/- SD) of microvessels in the cortex and 94% +/- 14% in the striatum were patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic animals, immediately after clot injection, microvessels in the cortex and striatum were occluded, mainly in the territory irrigated by the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hour after clot injection, microvessels had reopened in most of the cortex but remained occluded in some portions of the striatum, possibly as a result of downstream movement of fragments formed from the original clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By 3 hours after clot injection, microvessels in the cortex were patent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, whereas in the striatum microvessels were patent in 50% of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the other 50%, small striatal perfusion deficits persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours after clot injection, microvessels were patent in both the cortex and striatum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals except one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that intracerebral clots dissolve spontaneously in a relatively short period of time, but that fragments formed from the clot may obstruct more distal blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is likely that clot fragments lodge in arteries with lower blood flow and poor collateral perfusion, where they continue to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for a longer duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results may in part explain the resistance of the striatum to neuroprotective strategies used for the treatment of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
