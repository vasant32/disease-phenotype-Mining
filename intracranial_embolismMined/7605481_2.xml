<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The description of the epidemiologic profile and analysis of the mortality of infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE) observed from 1984-1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred thirty episodes of IE in a native valve (30 in drug addicts [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVDA</z:e>] and 20 cases of nosocomial acquisition) were analyzed with right/left/bilateral localization (42/84/4, respectively), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the mitral/aortic/tricuspid valve (52/47/34, respectively) and the etiology was determined as Staphylococcus aureus in 52 cases, 41 Streptococcus, 13 negative coagulase Staphylococcus, and 11 Enterococcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High risk IE were identified by uni and multivariate analysis (MVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of IE ranged from 0.36 and 0.70 cases x 1.000 admitted adults/year (mean: 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography detected <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> vegetations in 67% of the cases with the validity to predict the development of embolisms being 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MVA showed the embolic episodes (present in 45% of the IE) to be associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVDA</z:e> patients and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter complication, being defined as &gt; or = 10 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> under appropriate treatment, was observed in 32% of the cases and was due to mild (n = 15) and severe causes (n = 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postembolic septic complications were associated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> with MVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty three patients died (18%), 2 IVDA and 5 nosocomial IE, mainly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The independent risk factor predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) were: age &gt; or = 60 years (mortality 34%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> (55%), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (37%), and the exclusion of the patient as a candidate for surgery (73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To the contrary, right IE (mortality 0%) and cardiac surgery (5%) favoured survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To improve the prognosis of infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in high risk patients more opportune cardiac surgery accepting greater risks should be performed </plain></SENT>
