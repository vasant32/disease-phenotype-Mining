<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is emerging evidence that coronary catheterization can cause cerebrovascular embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the proportion of cardiac patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli before coronary catheterization and the proportion with newly developed <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism shortly after coronary catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-seven patients attending Westmead Hospital for coronary catheterization between December 2005 and February 2006 were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical history, physical examination, and pre- and postcatheterization photography of 5 retinal fields was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with new <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli was assessed by comparing post- and precatheterization <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before catheterization, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli were observed in 5 patients (5.2%) and were significantly associated with higher body mass index (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of angiographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was not significantly associated with preexisting <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 97 patients, we found no new emboli within the 16-hour (median: range 4 to 45 hours) postcoronary catheterization period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli are relatively common in patients being assessed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence suggesting coronary catheterization contributes to <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism shortly after the procedure </plain></SENT>
