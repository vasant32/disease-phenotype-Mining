<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is some evidence of beneficial metabolic effects associated with the pH-stat than with alpha-stat perfusion strategy, but this is tempered by a likely increased risk of embolism to the brain, especially in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated this possible adverse effect in an experimental model that combined hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>) and embolic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four female juvenile pigs undergoing 25 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> at a brain temperature of 18 degrees C were assigned to either alpha-stat (n = 12) or pH-stat (n = 12) strategy during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before the initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>, the descending aorta was clamped and 200 mg of albumin-coated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> microspheres (250 to 750 microm in diameter) were injected into the isolated aortic arch in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 7-day survival rate was 75% in the pH-stat group and 50% in the alpha-stat group (p = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pH-stat group had significantly better behavioral scores on postoperative days 5 (p = 0.03) and 6 (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pH-stat strategy was associated with better postoperative intracranial pressures and histopathologic scores, but such differences did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The alpha-stat group had lower brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations postoperatively as well as higher brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratios CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pH-stat strategy does not cause any worse brain injury than the alpha-stat strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the pH-stat strategy is associated with a slightly better outcome compared with the alpha-stat strategy, even in the setting of cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that the pH-stat strategy could also be used in adults during deep hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass despite the increased risk of intraoperative cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
