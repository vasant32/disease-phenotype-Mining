<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 195 consecutive patients who underwent CAS between December 2007 and March 2010 in a general hospital were enrolled and divided into two groups: with DR and without DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk factors of DR were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complications of DR were recorded and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 30 (15.4%) patients with DR of EPDs were observed, of whom EPDs were successfully retrieved in 29, and in 1 was it taken out by surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The retrieval time was significantly longer in patients with DR (490.5 ± 143.9 s) than in patients without DR (157.2 ± 15.7 s, p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was observed more frequently in patients with DR than in patients without DR (55.2% vs. 14.5%, p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracranial compilations were more frequent in patients with DR than in those without DR (17.2% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calcified plaques, degree of residual stenosis, types of the stents, and tortuosity index (TI &gt; 80°) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis indicated that calcified plaques (odds ratio (OR) = 6.5; p = 0.000) and TI &gt; 80° (OR = 18.8; p = 0.000) were independent predictors of DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Calcified plaques and TI &gt; 80° may be related to DR in patients with CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DR may lengthen the retrieving time and increase the complications of the procedure </plain></SENT>
