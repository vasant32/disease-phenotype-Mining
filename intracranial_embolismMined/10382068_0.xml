<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The common finding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> between the bifoil balloons when they were extracted after mitral dilation prompted us to look for evidence of minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolisms</z:e> using the sensitive technique of BMRI (brain magnetic resonance T2-weighted imaging) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BMRI was performed within 48 hr before and after a percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy (PMBC) in each of the 63 patients in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was evidence (hyperintensity foci: HI) of a previous asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> in 38 of 63 patients before PMBC and a new HI appeared in 18 of 63 patients after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New HI signals were found exclusively in the white matter in 8 of 18 patients and in only 3 of 18 were HI signs larger than 1 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient, with an HI signal &gt; 1 cm in the thalamus and another &lt; 1 cm in the brain stem, presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> accompanied by other minor clinical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differences in HI rate among four subgroups (1, older vs younger than 43 years; 2, sinus rhythm vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>; 3, echo score &lt; 8 vs &gt; 8; 4, patients from western countries vs the others) were not statistically significant, probably because the number of patients in each subgroup was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> had slightly more (not significant) HI before PMBC (15/20, 75%) than patients in sinus rhythm (23/43, 53%), but after PMBC their HI frequencies were similar (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>: 5/20, 25%; sinus rhythm: 13/43, 30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Brain microembolism is frequent during PMBC, but is often anatomically limited and free from clinical signs in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain embolism</z:e> seems to be related mainly to the procedure itself and not the features of the patient </plain></SENT>
