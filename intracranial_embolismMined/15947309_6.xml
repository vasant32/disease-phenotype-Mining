<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and cerebrovascular reactivity, with attention for the perioperative high-intensity transient signals (HITS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective comparative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Urban university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Candidates for cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Measurement of HITS as a reflection of embolic load was performed in 50 patients (on-pump CABG, n = 32; off-pump CABG, n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To measure cognitively induced cerebrovascular reactivity, cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV) was measured preoperatively in 66 patients, early postoperatively (after 6 days) in 63 patients, and late postoperatively (after 6 months) in 44 patients during five cognitive tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the same session, seven standardized neuropsychological tests were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A higher embolic load was found in the on-pump group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the on-pump group, aortic cannulation was the most important HITS-prone surgical maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (using surgical technique as between-subjects factor and significant differences between both groups as covariates) on the group data revealed no significant differences in neuropsychological performance and BFV immediately after surgery or at 6 months after surgery, compared with preoperative performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No main effect of surgery was found for neuropsychological performance and BFV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were found between the number of HITS and the degree of postoperative neuropsychological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Individual comparisons revealed that 60% (59.4% in the on-pump group; 61.1% in the off-pump group) of the patients undergoing CABG showed evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> soon after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 24.2%, the cognitive sequelae persisted at 6 months follow-up (31.8% in the on-pump group; 9.1% in the off-pump group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> index (sum of impaired neuropsychological tests) showed a significant difference after 6 months between both surgery groups with fewer neurocognitive tests that remained impaired in the off-pump group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In off-pump surgery, significantly fewer HITS were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On an individual level, more favorable results in neuropsychological test performance were demonstrated in the off-pump group after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The number of HITS showed no correlation with degrees of early and late postoperative neuropsychological impairment </plain></SENT>
