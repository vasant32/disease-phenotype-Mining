<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Decreased fibrinolytic capacity due to increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity and decreased tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or atherothrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to observe associations of the genetic polymorphism for PAI-1 and t-PA with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and to elucidate whether impaired fibrinolytic activity in atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was related to atherothrombosis per se or to other risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 60), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n = 100), and control subjects (n = 100) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects for 4G/5G polymorphism in the promoter region of the PAI-1 gene and the Alu-repeat insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in intron h of the t-PA gene by polymerase chain reaction and endonuclease digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the 4G/4G genotype of PAI-1 was significantly higher in the atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients than the control subjects (41.7 versus 21%; p = 0.005), but not in the hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between 4G/4G genotype of PAI-1 and atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio = 3.11, 95% confidence interval 1.18-8.15), adjusting for age, sex, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the number of the I/I genotype of t-PA in the atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or hypertensive patients was virtually identical to the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the 4G/4G genotype of the PAI-1 gene is significantly associated with an increased risk of atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding also supports that impaired fibrinolytic activity in atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is related to atherothrombosis per se, but not to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, one of the most important risk factors of atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
