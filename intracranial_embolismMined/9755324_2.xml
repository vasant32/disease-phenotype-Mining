<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 72 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) the relationship between the amount of subarachnoid blood clots detected by initial cranial computed tomography (CCT) up to 48 hours after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and the later development of vasospasm, established by blood flow velocity measurement with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serial Doppler examinations started within the first 72 hours after SAH and were carried out every second day up to three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each Doppler recording was accompanied by a neurological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients classified as Hunt and Hess grade V were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with remarkable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> in CCT or with intracranial pressure above 25 mmHg were also excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the well known age-dependence of vasospasm after SAH, two age groups were formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant correlation (p &gt; 0.05) between blood flow velocities and blood load after SAH was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the investigated 72 individuals was 48.9 years (14 up to 76 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>47 patients were younger than 56 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis indicated a correlation with a quite low significance level (r = 0.350, p &lt; 0.025) between TCD blood flow velocities and blood load in CCT in these younger subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation (p &gt; 0.05) between these two variables could be established in the 25 patients older than 55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a second step an intra-individual comparison of side-to-side differences in TCD and CCT was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in blood flow velocities between subjects with or without side-to-side differences in cisternal blood load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the amount of blood visible on initial CCT after SAH is not a powerful predictor of cerebral blood flow velocities measured by TCD </plain></SENT>
