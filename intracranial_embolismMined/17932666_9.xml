<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We report an in vitro study comparing the effectiveness of clot removal and clot fragmentation of five embolectomy systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A flow model was embolized with fresh and old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, occluding an inner diameter of 2-5 mm simulating internal carotid artery (ICA), basilar artery (BA) and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) branch occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Embolectomy was performed using five retrieval systems: CATCH (Balt), Merci retriever (Concentric), InTime and Attracter (Boston Scientific), and the Phenox Clot Retriever (Phenox) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clot removal and evidence and type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> fragmentation and distal embolization were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no observable differences attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Merci, CATCH and Phenox Clot Retriever were equally able to mobilize and remove <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> with the exception of one particularly firm clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were marked differences in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> fragmentation and distal embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> devices produced micro- and macrofragments during penetration and retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Phenox Clot Retriever was able to filter fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The InTime and Attracter devices failed to retrieve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in this model and achieved partial removal at best with a tendency towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> displacement and fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Within limits, the experimental setup was appropriate for generating occlusions of diameter 2-5 mm of various lengths, simulating ICA, BA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this model, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> mobilization appeared to be less dependent upon the individual design of the retrieval system than on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ability to prevent distal embolization is, however, strongly dependent on the ability of a thrombectomy device to capture fragments that are generated during removal of the device </plain></SENT>
