<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) can identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left-shunts</z:hpo> that predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a large cohort we compared the results of both techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 222 patients were investigated by both techniques using the contrast agent Echovist-300 and performing each test once without and once with the Valsalva maneuver (VM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TEE-proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left-shunts</z:hpo> were detected by TCD with a high sensitivity of 94% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, TCD revealed shunts not noted during TEE in about 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These shunts are in general smaller than those concordantly identified; however, 9% of the patients without a TEE-proven shunt presented with a shunt that allows a considerable amount of contrast medium to pass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 12% more microbubbles detected in the right middle cerebral artery than in the left middle cerebral artery during the TCD test performed with VM, but not during the TCD test performed without VM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced TEE and TCD are complementary methods in the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The side difference of microbubbles may indicate a selective streaming of cardiac emboli during VM </plain></SENT>
