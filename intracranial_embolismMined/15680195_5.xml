<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we analyzed long-term effects of sequential cortical lesions on brain volume and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats received either single photothrombotic lesions in the forelimb sensorimotor cortex (SL) or two lesions in sequence either immediately (DL0), 2 days (DL2), 7 days (DL7), or 10 days (DL10) after the first surgery in the homotopic contralateral area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> and global brain volume were measured 7 days (SL and DL2 groups) and one month (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups) after the last period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the weeks following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the single lesion shrank considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This shrinkage was accentuated by a further lesion received either earlier or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one days after obtaining the second lesion, the lesion scars on both sides had a mean volume of 5.8 +/- 2.3 mm3 in DL2 as compared to 8.5 +/- 3.5 mm3 in SL-animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a super-additive loss of residual brain volume by 2.2-8.0% in each hemisphere in animals with sequential lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the watermaze, this loss of brain volume corresponded to a slight but significant impairment in performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study revealed a complex interaction of lesions in animals with sequential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> associated with global reduction of brain volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> indicating degenerative processes beyond the lesions itself </plain></SENT>
