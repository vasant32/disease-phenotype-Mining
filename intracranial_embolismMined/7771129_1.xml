<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report on the endovascular occlusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> with GDC coils in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases, the diagnosis was made because of subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients complained about <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and one patient had an oculomotor palsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings were incidental in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the internal carotid artery in 4 of the 6 females and in the 2 males (mean age 50 years) and a basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indication for endovascular treatment was established after carefully weighing the risks against those of a neurosurgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was possible to occlude completely the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by induced electrothrombosis and to preserve the patency of the main vessel in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One female (case 6) developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> due to embolism of a medial branch six hours after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This receded completely after thrombolysis with urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A second patient showed further growth of the internal carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> on the control angiogram obtained after six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our initial results are encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With increasing experience, endovascular treatment is expected to become the method of choice for the treatment of most inoperable <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
