<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In experimental studies, embolization of the cerebral hemisphere with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> emulsion has revealed reversible magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the changes in the major metabolites, by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), in a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> induced by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> emulsion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The internal carotid arteries of 19 cats were injected with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> emulsion, and multivoxel MRS was performed 30 min, 1 day, and 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control group, six cats were injected with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectra were evaluated for N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cr), and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Cho), along with the presence of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative analyses of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr, Cho/Cr, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>/Cr ratios compared the median values of the ipsilateral metabolite ratios with those of the contralateral side and in the control group for each point in time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr, Cho/Cr, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cho ratios in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere of the embolized group after 30 min, 1 day, and 7days were not significantly different from the contralateral hemisphere of the embolized and control groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>/Cr ratio in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere of the embolized group was significantly higher when compared with the control group (P=0.012 at 30 min, P=0.001 on day 1, and P=0.018 on day 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> induced by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> emulsion resulted in no significant change in the major metabolites of the brain in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, except for an elevated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>/Cr ratio, which suggests the absence of any significant hypoxic-ischemic changes in the lesions embolized using a fat emulsion </plain></SENT>
