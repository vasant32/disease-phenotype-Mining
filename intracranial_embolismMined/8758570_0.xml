<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 6 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and one case of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The condition presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or dizziness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was reduced by atrial stimulation (3 cases) or by cardioversion (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevention of recurrence with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases but was responsible for secondary effects in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient, recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> was complicated by right <z:mp ids='MP_0001855'>atrial thrombosis</z:mp> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients were reoperated after cardiac catheterisation and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgery consisted of resection of a stenosis of the anastomosis in one case, and the transformation of atriopulmonary anastomosis into a total cavopulmonary bypass because of a very <z:mp ids='MP_0004062'>dilated right atrium</z:mp> without stenosis in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The immediate postoperative period was complicated by a recurrence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 3 children not treated by antiarrhythmic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At long-term, one patient died 6 months after withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> therapy of recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five of the 6 survivors are treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> or a betablocker; 3 have had pacemaker implantation for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Late atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> complicating atrio- and cavopulmonary bypass procedures carry a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When diagnosed, the patient should be investigated for stenosis of the anastomosis but severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the right atrium is often the only finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After restoration of sinus rhythm, maintenance antiarrhythmic therapy should be continued indefinitely </plain></SENT>
