<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our mid-term results of 55 consecutive symptomatic patients (mean age: 47 years, range: 20-79) who underwent percutaneous transcatheter closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> after at least one event of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>; 16 (29%) patients had at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and 39 (71%) patients at least one embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple embolic events had occurred in 6 (11%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous transcatheter closure was technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 55 patients (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the majority of patients, an Amplatzer <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> occluder measuring 25 mm in diameter (n=49) or an Amplatzer <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> occluder measuring 35 mm in diameter (n=6) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete occlusion by color Doppler and transesophageal contrast echocardiography investigation was achieved in 96% at follow-up 3-6 months after implantation; only 2 patients had a trivial residual shunt at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean fluoroscopy time was 6.7 minutes (range: 1.7-47.1), and in-hospital follow-up was uneventful except for 1 patient who developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> requiring uneventful and successful needle pericardiocentesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 19 months (range: 3-32) no recurrent embolic neurological events was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transcatheter closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> with Amplatzer <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> occluder devices is a safe and effective therapy for patients with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> and aneurysmatic or nonaneurysmatic <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous closure is associated with a high success rate, low incidence of hospital complications, and freedom of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> events </plain></SENT>
