<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Despite proven safety of endovascular coil embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, the potential need for retreatment remains criticized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this prospective study was to assess the safety, durability, and effect on recanalization rates of the Cerecyte (Micrus Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) bioactive coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred twelve ruptured and unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 176 patients were prospectively enrolled in a database registry during a 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adverse clinical outcomes directly attributed to the use of the Cerecyte coil were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographic outcomes were determined immediately after coil embolization and during follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who received stent assistance or a non-Cerecyte coil were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two independent endovascular surgeons reviewed follow-up films </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Any discrepancy was deemed a recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After exclusion criteria, 81 patients with 89 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were available for a minimum of 6 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of those 89 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 65% were ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and were treated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was 7 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean angiographic follow-up period was 11.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrences requiring retreatment as a result of dome filling were identified in six <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (6.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (4%) developed compaction of more than 20%, which was defined as interstitial filling of the fundus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was one thromboembolic event leading to permanent neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No cases of chemical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> or delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Cerecyte bioactive coil seems to be safe and effective for use in both ruptured and unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The bioactive polymer within the coils allows similar handling characteristics of a bare <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Studies to assess long-term outcomes with direct comparison to <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coils and alternative bioactive coils are warranted </plain></SENT>
