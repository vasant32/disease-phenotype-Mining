<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty of the 22 patients with vegetations recognizable by echocargiography died, or underwent cardiac operation (mean interval from admission 22 days, and range two to 120 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vegetations were seen on the echocardiograms in 22 (aortic 10, mitral nine and tricuspid three, with anatomic confirmation in 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of patients without vegetations on echocardiography none underwent emergency operation or died as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> (mean follow-up period of 14 months, range of two to 38 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other echocardiographic findings in those with vegetations included early mitral-valve closure (six), "flail" aortic leaflet (three), and "flail" mitral leaflet (three) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography can provide a rapid, reliable noninvasive diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> vegetations in certain patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> and may identify patients with more severe disease who may require operative intervention </plain></SENT>
