<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with proximal common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis, the guiding catheter is difficult to introduce into the narrow origin of the CCA without risking cerebral embolization before activation of the protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A technique of cerebral protection by internal carotid artery (ICA) clamping with or without simultaneous external carotid artery (ECA) clamping was used to treat patients with proximal CCA stenosis by the retrograde direct carotid approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The carotid bifurcation was surgically exposed and retrograde catheterization was performed to approach the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ICA was clamped during angioplasty and stenting to avoid cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ECA was clamped simultaneously if any extracranial-intracranial anastomosis was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of five patients treated with this technique experienced ischemic complications attributable to this technique </plain></SENT>
