<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CAS carries an inherent risk of distal cerebral embolization, precipitating new brain ischemic lesions and neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the frequency of new ischemic lesions found on DWI after protected CAS placement and to determine its association with plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients (mean age 65.13 ± 7.08 years) with moderate and severe internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> underwent CAS with distal filter protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrolipid and fibrocalcified plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was determined by sonography according to the relative contribution of echogenic and echolucent material, and by multisection CT using plaque attenuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 46.81% of patients with fibrolipid and 53.19% with fibrocalcified plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DWI was performed before and 24 hours after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven (14.89%) patients showed new lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four (8.51%) had 6 new lesions inside the treated vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three had a single lesion and 1 patient had 3 lesions (mean: 1.5 ± 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most lesions (66.66%) were subcortical, with a mean diameter of 9 mm (range 5-15 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions occurred in the area supplied by the middle cerebral artery and were clinically silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship was found between plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and the appearance of new lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with fibrolipid plaques had a significantly higher number of new lesions compared with patients with fibrocalcified plaques (P = .041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The absolute risk of new lesions in the fibrolipid group was 18.18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: New ischemic lesions were observed in the treated vascular territory in 8.51% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The appearance of new ischemic lesions was significantly related to the plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Fibrolipid plaques were associated with higher numbers of new lesions </plain></SENT>
