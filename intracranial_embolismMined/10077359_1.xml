<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study is a retrospective analysis of the therapeutical outcome in 66 patients over 60 years of age with toxic nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000853'>goitre</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided in two groups: Group A: 28 patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50673">methimazole</z:chebi> treatment: starting dose 5-30, median (M) 10 mg, maintenance dose 2.5-15 (M = 5) mg, follow up 6 to 240 months (M = 23.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group B: 38 patients treated by either 100-300 MBq (N = 14, subgroup B1) or 325-1000 MBq (N = 24, subgroup B2) 131I, follow up: 18 to 156 months (M = 48 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the different therapeutical approaches were compared by calculating the occurrence rate of persisting and relapsing thyroid dysfunctions and associated side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 28 patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50673">methimazole</z:chebi> treatment became euthyroid after 1-16 (M = 5) months but numerous relapses occurred in the follow up: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo>, clinical: 5, subclinical 13, (relapse duration: M = 8 months; associated symptoms: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 3, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in 1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> in 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in 2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor patient's compliance (9/28) or dose reduction by the physician (5/28) were the main causes of the relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient clinical (3 cases) or subclinical (6 cases) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> also occurred (duration: 1-3 M = 2 months, no clinical symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 7 out of 14 (50%) patients receiving 100-300 MBq 131I (Group B1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> persisted (versus 4/24 -16.7%- in Group B2 following 325-1000 MBq 131I; chi2(1) = 4.78 P = 0.028), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50673">methimazole</z:chebi> treatment had to be continued in 9/14 patients (64.3%) (versus 5/24 -20.8%)- in Group B2., chi2(1) = 7.18 P = 0.0074) and in 5/14 (35.7%) the radiotherapy had to be repeated (versus 5/24 -020.8%- in Group B2, not sign.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our conclusions are: 1) long term thyrostatic treatment is not safe in elderly patients with toxic nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo>, mainly because of poor compliance or dose reduction by the physician; 2) radioiodine treatment as the first choice should be recommended for these patients and higher doses should be preferred </plain></SENT>
