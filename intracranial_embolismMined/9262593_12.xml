<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relation between atheroma severity and other outcome measures or numbers of emboli has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using transesophageal echocardiography, we determined the severity of atheroma in the ascending, arch, and descending aortic segments in 84 patients undergoing operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients were monitored using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 33.3% among 9 patients with mobile plaque of the arch and 2.7% among 74 patients with nonmobile plaque (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac complications were not significantly related to atheroma severity in any aortic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Length of stay was significantly related to atheroma severity in the aortic arch (p = 0.025) and descending segment (p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of severe atheroma in both the arch and descending segments was associated with significantly longer hospital stays as compared with patients with severe atheroma in neither segment (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Numbers of emboli were greater in patients with severe atheroma at clamp placement, although the differences did not achieve statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic atheroma severity is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to the duration of hospitalization after coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lack of correlation between numbers of emboli and atheroma severity suggests that m any emboli may be nonatheromatous in nature </plain></SENT>
