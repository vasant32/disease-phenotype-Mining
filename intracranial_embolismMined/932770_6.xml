<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 10 of these cases, only the intracranial vessels were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 16 other cases, the entire cerebral arterial supply was dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more often related to occlusion of the vertebral artery involving the termination of the artery (7/10 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 6 cases a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on an atheromatous plaque and, once, an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> of cardiac origin, were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were usually due either to occlusion of the vertebral artery (14/23 cases), reaching, in 10 cases, the mouth of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) or to an isolated occlusion of the latter vessel (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on an atheromatous plaque was found in 15 cases, and emboli from the heart or from the origin of the vertebral artery in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dorsal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were related, in 4/5 cases, to an isolated occlusion of the stem of the PICA and, in the other case, to one of the vertebral artery involving the ostium of the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> due to atheromatous stenosis was found in 4 cases, an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> of cardiac origin in the other one </plain></SENT>
