<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the safety and efficacy of protection devices used during CAS by detecting new cerebral ischemic lesions using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in 95 patients who underwent 98 CAS procedures: 34 using single PercuSurge GuardWire, 31 using double balloon protection, 15 using proximal flow reverse protection devices, 14 using Naviballoon, and 4 using filter anti-embolic devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed preoperatively and postoperatively to evaluate the presence of any new embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative diffusion-weighted imaging revealed 117 new ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, two minor and one major, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ipsilateral to the treated carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients had clinically silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of new embolic lesions was lower using the proximal flow reverse protection device than with the double balloon protection (33% vs. 48.4%), but the volume of ipsilateral new ischemic lesions per patient was 136.6 mm(3) vs. 86.9 mm(3), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection with Naviballoon yielded ipsilateral lesions of large volume (86.6 mm(3)) and higher number (5.7 lesions per patient) than using the filter anti-embolic device (34.8 mm(3) and 1 lesion per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New cerebral ischemic lesions after neuroprotected CAS are usually silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lower incidence of distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> using proximal flow reverse and double balloon protection devices is limited by the larger volume and higher number of ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
