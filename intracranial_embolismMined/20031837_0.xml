<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are a principal mechanism of cognitive injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to study the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during CPB and to evaluate the effectiveness of evidence-based CPB circuit component and process changes on the exposure of the patient to emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: M-Mode Doppler was used to detect emboli in the inflow and outflow of cardiopulmonary circuit and in the right and left middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doppler signals were merged into a single display to allow real-time associations between discrete clinical techniques and emboli detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty-nine isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients were studied between 2002 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference in median microemboli detected in the inflow of the CPB circuit, (Phase I, 931; Phase II, 1214; Phase III, 1253; Phase IV, 1125; F [3,158]=0.8, P=0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant changes occurred in median microemboli detected in the outflow of the CPB circuit across phases, (Phase I, 702; Phase II, 572; Phase III, 596; Phase IV, 85; F [3,157]=13.1, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant changes also occurred in median microemboli detected in the brain across phases, (Phase I, 604; Phase II, 429; Phase III, 407; Phase IV, 138; F [3,153]=14.4, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit were associated with an 87.9% (702 versus 85) reduction in median microemboli in the outflow of the CPB circuit (P&lt;0.001), and a 77.2% (604 versus 146) reduction in microemboli in the brain (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in CPB techniques and circuit components, including filter size and type of pump, resulted in a reduction in more than 75% of cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
