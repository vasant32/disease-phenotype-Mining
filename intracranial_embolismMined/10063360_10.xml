<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 76-year-old male developed left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in July 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was thrombosed giant vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He showed progressive symptoms and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo>, but refused surgery and was followed up without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He died of rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and underwent autopsy in March 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> revealed fresh clot in the aneurysmal lumen, old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> surrounding the aneurysmal lumen, and more recent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> between the old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and the inner aneurysmal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most important histological feature was the many clefts containing fresh blood clots in the old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> near the wall of the distal neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These clefts were not lined with endothelial cells, and seemed to connect the lumen of the parent artery with the most peripheral fresh <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the diameter of each of these clefts is apparently not large enough to transmit the blood pressure of the parent artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Simple dissection of the aneurysmal wall by blood flow in the lumen through many clefts in the old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> of the distal neck may be involved in the growth and rupture of thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
