<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these embolized rats, passive avoidance response was impaired at early stages after the embolization (3 days, 1 and 2 weeks), but 4 to 8 weeks later, recovery was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reduction in the activities of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (CAT) in the left side of the occipital cortex and hippocampus was observed in parallel with the impairment of learning behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that impairments in the septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathways are likely to be closely related with the behavioral impairment in these rats </plain></SENT>
