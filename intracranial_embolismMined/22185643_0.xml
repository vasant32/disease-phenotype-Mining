<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, mechanical support is the most promising alternative to cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ventricular assist devices (VADs) were originally used to provide mechanical circulatory support in patients awaiting planned heart transplantation ('bridge-to-transplantation' therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The success of short-term bridge devices led to clinical trials evaluating the clinical suitability of long-term support ('destination' therapy) with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first larger scale, randomised trial that tested long-term support with an LVAD reported a 44% reduction in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with an LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In spite of the success of LVADs as bridge-to-transplantation and long-term support, patients managed by these devices are still at risk of several adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most devastating complication is caused by embolisation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> formed within the LVAD or inside the heart into the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> formation is attempted through anticoagulation management and by improving LVADs design; however, there is still significant occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Investigators have reported that the incidence of thromboembolic cerebral events ranges from 14% to 47% over a period of 6-12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Methods and approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An alternative method to reduce the incidence of cerebral embolisation is proposed by the co-authors, and the hypothesis is that it is possible to minimise the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> flowing into the carotid and vertebral arteries by an optimal placement of the LVAD outflow conduit, with or without the addition of aortic bypass connecting the ascending aorta and the innominate artery (IA), or left carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This paper presents the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the aortic arch haemodynamics using a representative geometry of the human aortic arch with or without an alternative aortic bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In order to study the trajectory of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> within the aortic arch bed, the CFD code, Fluent 6.3, is utilised to resolve the flow field and to solve the Lagrangian particle tracking of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> released randomly at the inlet of the LVAD cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Results are presented for simulations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the range of 2-5Â mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The percentage of individual diameter as well as aggregate diameter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> flowing to the carotid and vertebral arteries as a function of LVAD conduit placement and aortic bypass implantation is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The influence of the LVAD conduit implantation and bypass reveals a nearly 50% variation in predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The adjustment of the location of the anastomosis of the LVAD outflow cannula as well as its angle of incidence plays a significant role in the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolisms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>By proper adjustment in this CFD study of a synthetic model of an aortic arch bed, we found that nearly a 50% reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> could be achieved for a configuration consisting of a shallow angle of implantation over a baseline <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> incidence of the LVAD cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Within the limitations of our model, we have established that the LVAD implantation geometry is an important factor and should be taken into consideration when implanting an LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It is possible that other parameters such as distance of the LVAD outflow cannula to the root of the IA could affect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> embolisation probabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, the results of this study suggest that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be significantly reduced by as much as 50% by tailoring the VAD implantation by a simple surgical manoeuvre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The results of this line of research may ultimately lead to techniques that can be used to estimate the optimal LVAD configuration in a patient-specific manner by pre-operative imaging </plain></SENT>
