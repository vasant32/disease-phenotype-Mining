<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequency and severity of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system complications in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may be greater than previously thought, particularly in the older population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risks of embolic neurologic complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the population older than 70 years from a severely atherosclerotic ascending aorta are well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, while the majority of CPB patients do not experience perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a high incidence of more subtle central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system dysfunction has been demonstrated to persist for up to 1 year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report reviews the incidence and severity of cerebral injury during CPB and the effects of both age and the severely atherosclerotic ascending aorta on adverse neurologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It discusses perioperative diagnostic methods, including transesophageal echocardiography, periaortic echocardiography, transcranial Doppler, and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography, and the benefit of pH management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic brain injury resulting from activation of injury-related enzymes as part of the systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> is briefly reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age has been shown to be the strongest predictor of neurologic sequelae in patients undergoing CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of embolic complications in the brain also increases in proportion to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the ascending aorta, which is age-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography has been found to be only partly useful in diagnosing these lesions or in guiding surgical manipulations in comparison with epiaortic imaging, which is more discreet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography have provided further evidence of microemboli during surgical manipulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a 316-patient prospective study, we found no differences in outcome between pH-stat and alpha-stat strategies during moderate hypothermic CPB, except in patients who were on bypass for more than 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Approximately 90% of these had a significant reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> with the alpha-stat method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Aprotinin, a serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi>, has been found in two separate, randomized, placebo-controlled trials to significantly lower incidences of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further study to develop therapeutic and preemptive strategies for prevention of brain injury is required, especially in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Aprotinin and other modalities aimed at suppressing the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to CPB may offer hope because they act to suppress injury-provoking enzymes and leukocyte activation that are, in part, responsible for organ system dysfunction following CPB </plain></SENT>
