<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN OF THE STUDY: Retrospective analysis of the methodology and results between October 1985 and October 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SITE OF THE STUDY: Pediatric Cardiology Service, Santa Marta Hospital, Lisbon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 43 consecutive children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary valve stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>4 children with Noonan's Syndrome were excluded from the study and the results of 45 valvuloplasties in 39 patients are analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Full diagnostic catheterization and right ventricular cineangiography were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One or two balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> catheters were inserted percutaneously in one or both femoral veins and positioned across the pulmonary valve under fluoroscopic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The balloons were then inflated to their maximum pressure with diluted contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 18 children follow up cardiac catheterization was performed 3 to 12 months after valvuloplasty (mean 6.7 /+- 2.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A satisfactory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was achieved in 35 patients (89%) with a substantial decrease in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVP) and in transvalvar peak systolic gradient (GR) (p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A further significant spontaneous reduction in RVP and GR was recorded on follow up catheterization (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A repeat BVP was performed in 6 children and was successful in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In cases a satisfactory relief of the stenosis was not achieved and 3 of them were submitted to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One child had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> leading to successful surgical valvotomy and with no sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Another child had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Ligation of a femoral vein was required in one case for haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0010444'>pulmonary insufficiency</z:hpo> resulted in 15 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our experience confirms that BPV is the method of choice for the treatment of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary valve stenosis</z:hpo> either isolated or associated to small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It proved to be a safe and effective technique for reduction of GR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Mortality, morbidity, costs of the treatment and hospitalisation time are lower for BPV than for surgery with comparable short term results </plain></SENT>
