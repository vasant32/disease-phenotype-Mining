<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The limits of detectability were tested in a blinded, then unblinded analysis of CT scans from 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the initial blinded analysis, sign detection exhibited the following mean values: sensitivity, 78.5%; specificity, 93.4%; positive predictive value, 66%; negative predictive value, 96.4%; accuracy, 91.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kappa statistics analysis indicated poor interobserver agreement (k = .38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of unblinded analysis were as follows: sensitivity, 69%; specificity, 94.4%; positive predictive value, 82.8%; negative predictive value, 88.7%; accuracy, 87.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was fair unblinded interobserver agreement (k = .53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unblinded analysis had a lower false-positive frequency and did not increase the number of true-positive determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that detection of the hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign on CT scans by multiple observers is a sensitive, accurate, and predictive indicator of middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
