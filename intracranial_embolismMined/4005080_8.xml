<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Persistent atrial standstill occurred in a father and his youngest son with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0010316'>Ebstein's anomaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cases routine electrocardiograms showed no atrial electrical activity and cross sectional echocardiograms showed inferior displacement of the septal tricuspid leaflet and tethering of the tricuspid leaflets to the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The father had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and died of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Necropsy showed attachment of the septal tricuspid leaflet below the membranous septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On serial histological examination fibrofatty infiltration of the right atrial wall, the atrioventricular node, and the inferior part of the His bundle up to the bifurcation was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The son had haemodynamic and electrophysiological findings consistent with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0010316'>Ebstein's anomaly</z:hpo> and persistent atrial standstill, for which permanent cardiac pacing was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The persistent atrial standstill with slow escape rhythm was most probably a consequence of the abnormalities in both the atrial wall and the His bundle which, together with the abnormal attachment of the tricuspid valve, may be features of the same congenital cardiac anomaly </plain></SENT>
