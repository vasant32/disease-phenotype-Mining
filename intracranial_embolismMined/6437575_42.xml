<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little of these increases occurred in the first hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole blood viscosity increased by 21%; plasma viscosity usually increased, and arterial pressure rose on average from 126/69 to 138/87 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma cholesterol concentration increased, in both high and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> fractions, but values of total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> fractions were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increases in platelets, red cells, and viscosity associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thermoregulatory adjustments to mild surface cooling provide a probable explanation for rapid increases in coronary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in cold weather </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The raised arterial pressure and possibly cholesterol concentration may contribute to slower components of the increased <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
