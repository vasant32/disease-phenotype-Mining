<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the influence of physical inactivity on insulin sensitivity in aged people, insulin sensitivity and secretion was measured by using a two-step euglycemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp, a glucagon tolerance test (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e>), an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGGT) and urinary CPR excretion in 11 aged patients immobilized in bed for more than 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those of nine healthy mobile aged controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The muscle volume of the immobilized patients decreased by 20-25% compared with that of the controls, and insulin sensitivity decreased 50% in each step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results mean that the immobilized patients had decreased insulin sensitivity and responsiveness, even when there was <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin responses in both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GTT</z:e> and OGTT showed that there was a slight decrease in the initial response of insulin in the immobilized patients and was in the controls compared with adolescent controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the initial response of insulin between the immobilized patients and the aged controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> in the OGTT was 4/11 of the immobilized patients and 3/9 of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total insulin secretion was increased and insulin sensitivity and responsiveness was decreased in the immobilized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the decreased insulin sensitivity was compensated for increased by insulin secretion in the immobilized patients </plain></SENT>
