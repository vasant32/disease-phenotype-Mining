<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> &gt; or =70% (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) were randomly assigned to filter-protected or unprotected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) of the brain was performed before and at 3 time points after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a subset of patients, high-intensity transient signals on transcranial Doppler (TCD) were recorded with categorisation of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were independently reviewed off-site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean age, proportion of octogenarians or presenting symptoms between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On procedural DWI (1-3 and 24 h after stenting), there were 7/24 (29%) and 4/22 (18%) new lesions in protected and unprotected patients respectively (p = 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 30 days there were 9/33 (26%) and 4/33 (12%) lesions in protected and unprotected patients, respectively (p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On TCD there were significantly more signals in total as well as particulate emboli during filter-protected CAS (426.5 and 251.3) than during unprotected CAS (165.2 and 92) - p = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Filter-protected CAS is associated with an increase in new lesions on DWI and significantly higher rates of total and particulate microembolisation on TCD than unprotected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of these findings requires further study </plain></SENT>
