<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five consecutive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> caused by embolism of the internal carotid artery (10 patients) and the proximal middle cerebral artery (15 patients) were treated using intraarterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systolic back pressure, measured through a microcatheter in the artery just distal to the emboli, ranged from 22 to 78 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to an angiographic inclusion criterion for good recanalization--that is, recanalization of the M2 or more distal arteries at the end of thrombolysis--21 of 25 patients underwent evaluation in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients volumes of low-density areas on computerized tomography (CT) scans obtained 2 months postthrombolysis were smaller in comparison with volumes of hyperintense areas on DW <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images acquired before treatment, whereas these low-density areas were larger in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with those on initial DW <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, the volume of abnormalities on CT scans obtained 2 months posttreatment were significantly reduced in patients with a systolic back pressure greater than 30 mm Hg (16 patients) than in those with a back pressure of 30 mm Hg or less (five patients) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systolic back pressures greater than 30 mm Hg were associated with significantly better modified Rankin Scale scores than those 30 mm Hg or less (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Back pressure measurement in combination with DW <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging can be used to predict the occurrence of infarction as demonstrated on CT scans following thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
