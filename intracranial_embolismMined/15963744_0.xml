<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective multicentre study, this hypothesis was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Centres that monitored for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> after CEA were identified by searching Medline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individual patient data were obtained from centres willing to collaborate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of emboli in 1h was computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for the variables gender, age and number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discriminative ability of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> monitoring was investigated in a ROC curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety-one patients were monitored in the first 3h after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two percent developed ischaemic cerebral complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed statistically significant associations between ischaemic cerebral complications and both gender and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, but not age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, &gt; or =8 MES/h showed a statistically significant relationship with cerebral complications (OR 8.1, 95% CI 1.8-36), in contrast to gender (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.9-5.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ROC curve yielded an AUC of 0.83 for monitoring of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support the use of TCD monitoring for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> shortly after CEA in order to identify patients at risk of developing ischaemic cerebral complications </plain></SENT>
