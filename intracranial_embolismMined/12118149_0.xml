<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The targets occurred at the same two spatial locations--to the left and right of the patient--with the task being cued by the color of the target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were able to perform both tasks separately rapidly and without error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, when the two tasks were interleaved, they had difficulty making a response in the left (contralesional) field when this was different to a response that they had just made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that lesions to the parietal cortex may cause a deficit in the coding for motor intention, as well as attention in the contralesional field </plain></SENT>
