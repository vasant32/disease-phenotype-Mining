<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although arterial hypoxemia is the classic etiology for such a mental status change, three less common etiologies should always be considered: cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath>, blunt carotid artery injury, and vertebrobasilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
