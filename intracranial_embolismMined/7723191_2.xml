<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to the causative lesions in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> group, periventricular hyperintensities (PVH), spotty lesions (SL), silent infarctions (SI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> (VD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> (CA) were analyzed in these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infarctions located in the internal capsule/<z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata were the most frequent causative lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to the low risk group, a high incidence of patchy/diffuse PVH, SI, and severe CA was seen in both the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> group and the high risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Widespread PVH and multiple SL increased with age in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> group, while severe CA was seen in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SI and VD tended to increase after age 60, though they were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, diagnosed in 40 out of 78 patients, increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed the degree of the effects of MRI findings on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> to be marked in PVH, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, causative lesions, and SL, in that order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that diffuse PVH and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, developing with age, promoted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the elderly with vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they suggested that a variety of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> recognized on MRI other than infarction can affect symptoms in the elderly </plain></SENT>
