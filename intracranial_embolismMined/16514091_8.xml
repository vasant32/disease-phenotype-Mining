<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The CARESS (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> and Aspirin for Reduction of Emboli in Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid Stenosis</z:hpo>) trial proved the effectiveness of the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and aspirin compared with aspirin alone in reducing presence and number of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in patients with recently symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed at installing primary and secondary quality control measures in CARESS because <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> evaluation relies on subjective judgment by human experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: As primary quality control, centers participating in CARESS evaluated a reference digital audio tape (DAT) before the study containing both <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement of classifying signals as <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was expressed as proportions of specific agreement of positive ratings (ps+/-values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DATs included in CARESS (n=300), online number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and off-line number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> read by the central reader were compared using correlation coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As secondary control, a sample of 16 of 300 DATs was cross-validated by another independent reader (post-trial validator) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the reference tape, the cumulative ps+/-value was 0.894 based on 12 of 14 observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two observers with very different results improved after a training procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Agreement between post-trial validator and central reader was ps+=0.805, indicating very good agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation between online evaluation and off-line evaluation of DATs was very good overall (cumulative rho=0.84; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multicenter studies using <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> as outcome parameter are feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, primary and secondary quality control procedures are important </plain></SENT>
