<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although he was without many risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> except smoking, chest computed tomography performed preoperatively showed a small calcification at the origin of the left subclavian artery on the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the first postoperative day, when the patient awoke from sedation, he presented with left conjugate deviation of the eyes and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediate computed tomography scanning revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the area of the left middle cerebral artery associated with hyper density indicating a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both transthoracic echocardiography and carotid ultrasonography were performed to determine the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, severe atheromatous stenosis of the left internal carotid artery was noticed, while there was neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> nor shunt in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> during surgical manipulation of the carotid artery were strongly suspected as a possible cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative carotid screening by ultrasonography may be advocated to identify such a patient as the present case with occult carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> at risk for a subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
