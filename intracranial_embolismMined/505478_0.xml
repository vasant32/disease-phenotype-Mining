<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clot was prepared by incubating blood at room temperature for 2 hours to inactivate plasminogen activators and then refrigerating it at 4 degrees C for 22 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the experiment was to devise a model of the intravascular lesion and not of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dog was chosen as the experimental animal since it has a maxillocarotid artery which permits collateral flow beyond proximal internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A volume of clot measuring 0.25 to 0.30 cc was sufficient to occlude the artery for 48 hours in 80% of the animals without causing major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have used this model to study clot radiolabeling and suggest it may also have application for evaluating thrombolytic drugs </plain></SENT>
