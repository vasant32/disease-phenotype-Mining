<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze and summarize the clinical characteristics and risk factors for patients with hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> to provide guidance for its clinical treatment and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, data from 49 hospitalized patients with HT in the First Department of Neurology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University from October 2009 to March 2012, were reviewed retrospectively and 106 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> only during the same period, were chosen randomly as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gender and age of the patients were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relevant information was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SPSS 17.0 statistical package was applied for data processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Qualitative data were processed with Ï‡(2) test, and measurable data was processed with t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each index was analyzed with uni-variate analysis while statistically significant risk factors were included in the logistic review model to conduct the multivariate regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Clinical symptoms deteriorating after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 21 cases accounted for 42.9% of the HT group, among which the cases on degree of disturbance to consciousness had an aggravation in 8 cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> increase in another 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headaches</z:hpo> and dizziness were found in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(2) Number of infarction within 15 days after the occurrence of HT accounted for 87.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(3) HT-related factors increased the risk of HT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> such as cortical infarction, large area of infarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and high level of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most important factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(4) PH-2 seemed more unlikely to link with clinical symptoms than other subtypes of HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> after occlusion of the main artery trunk was prone to HT, especially when it appeared within 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Short-term prognosis seemed to be related to the subtypes of HT, with risk factors as cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> etc. on HT </plain></SENT>
