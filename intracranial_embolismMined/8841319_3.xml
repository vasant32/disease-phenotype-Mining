<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Activated protein C resistance (APC-R) due to factor V Leiden has recently been established as an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of abnormal or borderline functional APC-R in the absence of factor V Leiden is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that APC-R due to mechanisms other than factor V Leiden may also contribute to the development of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We describe three women who had superior sagittal and lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> while taking oral contraceptives and had a number of additional risk factors for CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each had APC-R for different reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, including APC-R, should be looked for in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional APC-R is a highly prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, but the reasons for this abnormality are diverse; abnormal and borderline functional APC-R results should be supplemented by DNA analysis for the presence of factor V Leiden </plain></SENT>
