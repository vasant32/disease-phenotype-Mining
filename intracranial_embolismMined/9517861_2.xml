<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: An intraoperative HITS detection study was performed on 77 patients (63 men, 14 women, mean age+/-SD, 64+/-8 years) with a total of 81 CEAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale the patients were clinically examined by a neurologist preoperatively and postoperatively within 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A deterioration of the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale was considered an intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> if persisting longer than 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cranial computed tomography (CT scan) was performed preoperatively and 3 to 5 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By means of TCD total HITS count and mean blood velocity changes, for shunting, were recorded sufficiently in the middle cerebral artery in 79 CEAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HITS were significantly more frequent in symptomatic [n = 53; HITS: median, 15 (range 1-159)] than in asymptomatic stenoses [n = 26; HITS: 6.5 (0-41); P &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the operation occurred in eight of the 81 CEAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On postoperative CT scans, five of the eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> showed new corresponding territorial infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> without new CT lesions, the mean blood velocity changes after clamping indicated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total HITS count was significantly higher in procedures with intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> [n = 8; HITS: 33 (11-159)] than in the uncomplicated [n = 71; HITS: 10 (0-62); P = 0.002] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 37 CEAs with 10 or less HITS, but eight in 42 CEAs with 11 or more HITS [P = 0.006; relative risk 1.23 (95% confidence interval: 1.06 to 1.43)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Microembolism seems clinically relevant in carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic patients may run a lower risk of intraoperative embolization </plain></SENT>
