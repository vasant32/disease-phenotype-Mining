<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We described the pathology produced in the brain following platelet embolism, previously described only in the retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The common carotid artery of the rat was irradiated for 6.5 minutes with an <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser at 514.5 nm after intravenous injection of a photosensitizing agent, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was seen in 1 rat 5 minutes after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A nonocclusive platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was present in the carotid artery 50 minutes after irradiation, with almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> being cleared 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> (1 to 10 days) changes in the brain included 44 small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 12/13 rats, cortical arterioles occluded with platelets and thickening of small vessels in normotensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> (4 to 12 weeks) changes included lacunes in the brains of normotensive rats and intimal proliferation of smooth muscle in the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the 1st animal model of (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with emboli produced in vivo rather than injected into the carotid, (2) intimal proliferation of smooth muscle without invasion of the vessel, and (3) lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model provides results important to the laboratory study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
