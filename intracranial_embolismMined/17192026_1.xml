<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of their presence in older people is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We included 96 participants (mean (SD) age 76.8 (6.7) years, 46% female) who were the control group in a case-control study to evaluate SCE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive functioning was assessed prospectively over 2.5 years, using the MMSE and CAMCOG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (SD) MMSE score was 28.7 (1.4) at baseline with an average (SD) drop of 0.79 (0.91) per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of SCE was not related to the annual drop in MMSE score, nor to the CAMCOG score at follow-up (p = 0.88 and p = 0.41, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses identified higher age in years (beta = 0.29, p = 0.003), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (beta = 0.31, p = 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (beta = 0.28, p = 0.003) as independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found no association between the presence of SCE and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in older people without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
