<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We occluded one internal carotid artery in 48 New Zealand White rabbits with whole blood emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five minutes later the rabbits were assigned to receive one of the following tissue plasminogen activator protocols: 1) intravenous square-wave infusion in a total dose of 10 mg/kg, 2) intravenous constant infusion in a total dose of 10 mg/kg, 3) intravenous square-wave infusion in a total dose of 3 mg/kg, or 4) regional intra-arterial square-wave infusion in a total dose of 3 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocities in the internal carotid arteries were continuously monitored during the study with Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 animals treated with a 10-mg/kg square-wave intravenous tissue plasminogen infusion, internal carotid artery blood flow was reestablished within 2 hours (57.9 +/- 33.3 minutes) after the initiation of treatment, whereas this was the case for only six (50%) of the 12 animals treated with a constant 10-mg/kg intravenous tissue plasminogen activator infusion (p less than 0.05, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid artery blood flow was restored within 2 hours (33.5 +/- 40.4 minutes) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals treated with a regional intra-arterial tissue plasminogen infusion in a total dose of 3 mg/kg and in only three (50%) of the six animals treated with the same dosage intravenously (p less than 0.05, signed rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The thrombolytic efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator in the rabbit cerebral vasculature was superior when the same intravenous dose was given as a square-wave rather than a constant infusion and when the drug was given as a regional intra-arterial infusion rather than intravenously </plain></SENT>
