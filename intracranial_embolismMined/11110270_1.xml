<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether an artificial membrane lung of nonmicroporous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53225">polyolefin</z:chebi> hollow fibers bonded with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> could prolong venoarterial extracorporeal lung assist (ECLA) with low dose systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in goats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> bonded circuits (Carmeda Bioactive Surface, "HB" group, n = 5) with non <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> bonded circuits ("NHB" group, n = 5) in venoarterial ECLA (V-A ECLA) for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activated coagulation time (ACT) was maintained at approximately 130 sec by systemic infusion of small doses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in the HB group, and at 200-230 sec in the NHB group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dose given during ECLA was 20.4 +/- 3.6 U/kg per hr in HB, and 50.9 +/- 14.2 U/kg per hr in NHB, significantly less in HB than NHB (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood gas changes across the oxygenator, bypass flow rate, platelet aggregation activity, platelet counts, fibrin monomer (FM) test, and antithrombin-III (AT-III) activity did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In HB, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were fewer and no abnormal neurologic symptoms were observed during ECLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> oxygenators with NHB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One NHB goat developed <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> on the 6th day of ECLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nonmicroporous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53225">polyolefin</z:chebi> hollow fibers can be bonded with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An artificial membrane lung constructed of these fibers showed good anticoagulation by decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation with a small dose of infused <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
