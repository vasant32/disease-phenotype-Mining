<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This prospective study was undertaken to determine the success rate, complications, and outcome of carotid artery stenting (CAS) without the use of cerebral protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 12 months, 94 high-grade stenoses of the carotid artery in 91 consecutive patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six (70%) of the stenoses were symptomatic and 28 (30%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 94 carotid stenoses CAS was successfully performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the procedure and within the 30 days afterwards, there were 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 3 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the 66 symptomatic patients, resulting in a combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of 5 of 66 (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one of these complications, a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, occurred during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 6-month follow-up, one additional major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in a originally symptomatic patient resulting in a combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of 6 of 66 (10%) for symptomatic patients at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No major complications occurred in asymptomatic patients during the procedure or in the 6-month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 6 months angiographic follow-up the restenosis rate with a degree of &gt;50% was 3 of 49 (6%) and the rate with a degree of &gt;or=70% was 1 of 49 (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral embolization during CAS is not the only cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate associated with the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of cerebral protection devices during the procedure may therefore not prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major complications following CAS </plain></SENT>
