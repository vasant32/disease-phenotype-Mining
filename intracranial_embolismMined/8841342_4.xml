<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) reliably detects the occurrence of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, TCD monitoring is a time-consuming and mentally strenuous procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess whether automatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection software devices acting as a "stand-alone system" are able to identify <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in patients with solid cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten records of TCD monitoring of the middle cerebral artery in patients with symptomatic high-grade carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were analyzed for the moments at which <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> occurred by four observers and three automatic detection software devices (RB11 on TC2000, Pioneer Version 2.10, and Embotec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the three software systems were assessed on the basic assumption that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were present if at least three of the four observers agreed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average number of 1-second periods in which <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected by the four observers per tape ranged from 5 to 39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall kappa values (and SEs) for chance-corrected interobserver agreement between the four observers ranged from .94 (.02) to .99 (.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The agreement between the software devices and the observers was lower, with kappa values (and SEs) ranging from .18 (.17) to .93 (.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RB11 and Embotec systems achieved a kappa value higher than 0.4 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tapes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Pioneer system failed to reach a kappa value of 0.4 in three tapes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The RB11 showed a sensitivity of 70% for detecting <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, the Embotec 62%, and the Pioneer 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic high-grade carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, a high degree of agreement in the detection of moments of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> can be achieved between observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The three automatic detection software devices reached less agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Supervision of TCD monitoring and assessment of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> by an experienced observer is still necessary </plain></SENT>
