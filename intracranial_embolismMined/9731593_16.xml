<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrovascular events (CVE) in patients with prosthetic heart valves (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53390">PHV</z:chebi>) have remained a severe and frequent complication despite oral anticoagulation with or without aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the possible pathophysiological involvement of platelet-derived microparticles (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi>) as a contributing factor for the increased incidence of CVE in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53390">PHV</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared in a retrospective, case-control study the clinical outcome after the implantation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53390">PHV</z:chebi> with several different independent morphological and functional methods, including simultaneous transcranial Doppler monitoring of both middle cerebral arteries, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi> detection by flow cytometry with use of platelet-specific antibodies, coagulation markers, and determination of the procoagulant activity by Russell's viper venom time, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent coagulation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight of 26 patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53390">PHV</z:chebi> had 9 CVE during 136 person-years of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring revealed an increased frequency of microembolic signals recorded over a 30-minute period in patients with CVE (75+/-25; median, 55; range, 27 to 248) compared with those without CVE (23+/-12; median, 7; range, 0 to 153; P&lt;0.05) or with control subjects (0; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry analysis showed increased levels of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi> in patients with compared to those without CVE (4.1+/-0.6% versus 2.4+/-0.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fluorescence-positive events gated; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased procoagulant activity was documented by the shortened Russell's viper venom time expressed as an increased level of platelet equivalents per microliter of plasma in patients compared with control subjects (+24.7+/-14.9%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with CVE had a higher excess of platelet equivalents per microliter of plasma than patients without CVE in relation to the controls (+68.7+/-36.7%; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mildly elevated thrombin-antithrombin III complexes (2.9+/-0.7; median, 2.3; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, &lt;2.0 microg/L) suggested incompletely suppressed thrombin formation, and fibrin generation (fibrinopeptide A) was in the upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (2.1+/-0.2; median, 1.8; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, &lt;2.0 ng/mL), despite adequate anticoagulation (INR=3.6+/-0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show increased microembolic signals, platelet microparticles, and procoagulant activity in symptomatic patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53390">PHV</z:chebi> and provide a potential pathophysiological explanation of CVE </plain></SENT>
