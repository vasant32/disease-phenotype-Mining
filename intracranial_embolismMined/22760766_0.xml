<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The new risk stratification scheme for establishment of oral anticoagulation CHA2-DS2-VASc performs better in risk stratification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared to the prior CHADS2 scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate in patients with known AF and cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the indication of oral anticoagulation under previous risk embolism according to the CHADS2 scale and new classification CHA2-DS2-VASc, assessing the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> with HAS-BLED scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 164 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 87 of them with known AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was recorded previous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment and criteria for prior anticoagulation taking into account CHADS2 scales and CHA2-DS2-VASc, including hemorrhagic risk scale HAS-BLED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In anticoagulated patients INR level was recorded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline patients characteristics according to previous anticoagulation, except higher percentage of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in anticoagulated patients (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>41.3% were anticoagulated with known AF prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From 52 non-anticoagulated patients, 61.5% met criteria for anticoagulation prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as CHADS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using CHA2-DS2-VASc, this percentage increased to 94.2% (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>78.8% of non-anticoagulated had a low risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> according to the scale HAS-BLED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In anticoagulated patients, 67.6% had suboptimal INR at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our study, we found low compliance scales of thromboembolic risk stratification in patients with AF for an optimal treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It should be increased its use for primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and optimization of anti-coagulant therapy in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
