<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sensorimotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (SMS) is often included among the lacunar syndromes, although the underlying cause of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-subtype is less well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end we analysed 32 patients presenting with a sensorimotor syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study protocol included vascular risk factors, echocardiography, Doppler sonography of carotid arteries, CT scan and MRI of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 23 men and 9 women, mean age 65.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was present in 28% and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 63% had sensorimotor deficit of faciobrachiocrural areas and 37% had faciobrachial or brachiocrural deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI disclosed a presumably relevant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 26 patients (81%); 20 patients (62%) localized to the territory of small perforating arteries, 3 patients (9.5%) in the internal borderzone, and 3 patients (9.5%) in cortical territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of 20 deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were larger than 15 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or non-vascular lesion was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A potential cardioembolic source was present in 5 patients (16%), whereas 2 patients (6%) had an ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> &gt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Small vessel disease was the most likely cause in 69% of our patients with SMS, whereas 31% had a potential cardioembolic source, large artery disease or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> not compatible with perforating artery disease </plain></SENT>
