<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present paper we studied different methods for a qualitative and quantitative morphologic assessment of the focal brain damage in rabbits after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery with vaseline microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study of the early brain ischaemic damage (4 to 12 hours after embolisation) was performed on serial coronal cryostat sections of hemispheres frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> enzyme-histochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the ischaemic area the necrotic cells were pale or negative after enzyme-histochemical reaction, but a quantitative assessment of the ischaemic area was approximative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Evans blue method for the identification of the region of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> at 24 hours after embolisation showed inconstant results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A reproducible method for a quantitative assessment of the ischaemic area up to the 24th hour after embolisation was proposed by Osborne and utilised in the present experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The volumetric assessment of the ischaemic area was obtained after delineation of brain damage areas at 8 preselected coronal levels with a computerized automatic image analyzer and by integration of areas with the distance between each level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In treated animals, the measures of the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were accurate and reproducible, and were suitable for neurophysiologic correlations </plain></SENT>
