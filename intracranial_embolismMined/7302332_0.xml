<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A patient aged 76 years developed transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>, a homonymous lateral hemianopsia, and left sensory deficiency, probably due to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An electroencephalogram one week later demonstrated localized "'arceau" rhythm around the vertex and typical centroparietal pseudo-periodic spikes (PLEDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These activities were no longer present three days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vertex mu did not react to opening of the eyes or clenching the fists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It reacted to stimuli (tactile or movement) of the lower limb contralateral to the affected cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The origin of rhythmic activities corresponding to different generators is discussed, and the probable pathological significance of the mu rhythm of the vertex emphasized </plain></SENT>
