<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared MRA and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography in 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> to test whether MRA presently provides an alternative to cerebral angiography for the diagnosis of these anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRA showed 19 of the 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> detected (86.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, problems, especially with turbulent or slow flow, resulted in 6 studies (27.3%) with limited and 2 with questionable demonstration of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and 1 false negative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At present, MRA is definitely inferior to angiography for the demonstration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, due to its lower resolution and other limitations </plain></SENT>
