<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also used 325 controls who had undergone echocardiography for other reasons during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each report was examined for the presence of predefined findings depending on their propensity for causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> via an embolic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of a highly probable source of embolism was low in cases (&lt; 3%) and no different from controls after adjusting for age and other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of a possible cardiac source of embolism was also low (&lt; 5%) and similar in cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of definite or possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> on echocardiography resulted in alteration in therapy in only 2% of cases, of whom 77% had either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, or Q waves on the electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the yield of highly probable or possible cardiac source of embolism in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> is very low with transthoracic echocardiography, and is no higher than that noted in similar patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
