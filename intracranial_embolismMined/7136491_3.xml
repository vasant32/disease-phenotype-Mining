<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP) syndrome in these patients is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A prospective study over a period of 1 year was carried out in order to evaluate the role of MVP in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurring in patients below the age of 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 38 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the young seen during this period, well-recognised risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> could be detected in 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MVP confirmed by M-mode echocardiography was seen in 13% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and in 23.8% of those in which there were no other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of MVP was much higher if only the clinical criteria for diagnosis were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We believe that MVP is a significant risk factor in younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, and, in such cases, merits investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probable pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic implications are discussed </plain></SENT>
