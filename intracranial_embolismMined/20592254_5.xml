<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the effectiveness of organized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes in the real-world setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the effect of organized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes in a longitudinal cohort study using data from the Registry of the Canadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July 2003 and September 2007, there were 6,223 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtype information by Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subtypes were categorized as large artery atherosclerotic disease, lacunar, cardioembolic, or other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount of organized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care was quantified using the previously published organized care index (OCI), graded 0-3 based on the presence or absence of occupational therapy or physiotherapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> team assessment, and admission to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality at 30 days was associated with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype and OCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher OCI (defined as score 2-3 compared to 0-1) was strongly associated with lower odds of 30-day mortality in each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtype (adjusted odds ratio estimates ranged from 0.16 to 0.43, p &lt; 0.001, controlling for age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, and medical comorbidities by logistic regression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These estimates were essentially unchanged after excluding patients treated with palliative care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Numbers needed to treat, to prevent 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 30 days, ranged from 4 to 9 across the subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A strong association between higher OCI and lower 30-day mortality was apparent in each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that organized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care should be provided to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients regardless of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
