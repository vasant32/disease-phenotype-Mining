<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein synthesis was evaluated with brain slices in vitro and subsequent cellular and subcellular fractionations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One group of animals developed clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> very rapidly and often died within 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these animals <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was diffuse in the right side of brain within a few hours post-operatively and there was persistent suppression in the electroencephalographic recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amino acid incorporation into protein of subcellular fractions was decreased to 50% of the opposite side at 30 minutes and further declined to less than 10% in 8 to 10 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another group of animals survived to 24 hours in spite of severe neurological manifestations, and protein synthesis was about 15% of the control side at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The suppression of protein synthesis was observed both in the neuronal and neurologlial fractions indicating similar vulnerability of these cellular elements toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> as shown with cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was emphasized that the correlation of clinical manifestations and biochemical data is very important to extract meaningful information from biochemical investigations in this model </plain></SENT>
