<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intraprocedural transcranial Doppler sonography has identified multiple microembolic events during and immediately after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or angioplasty, yet the rate of clinically evident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the significance of the transcranial Doppler sonography findings, we examined patients by use of diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging before and immediately after CEA for evidence of clinically silent ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients with atherosclerotic disease of the carotid arteries underwent diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging performed, on average, 3 days before and 12 hours after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted images were acquired in three orthogonal directions at b = 900 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative neurologic examinations were performed by the same physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After endarterectomy, 4.0% of the patients (one of 25 patients) showed a single, cortical focus of restricted diffusion and new fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity, measuring &lt;1 cm in diameter, ipsilateral to the CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postoperative neurologic examination showed no change in status from the preoperative baseline state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This patient had an intraoperative course complicated by the development of a large <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, necessitating thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of diffusion-weighted imaging may serve to improve conspicuity of clinically silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An important next step is to determine the risk factors that predispose to detectable parenchymal ischemic events </plain></SENT>
