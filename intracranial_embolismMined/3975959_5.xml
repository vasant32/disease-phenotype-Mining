<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP) in patients with ischemic attacks is puzzling when compared with the very low incidence of cerebrovascular attacks observed in individuals known to have MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine if it is possible to identify a patient subset with MVP at the highest risk of embolization on the basis of 2D-echocardiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the echocardiographic picture of a group of 39 patients with MVP and cerebral ischemic attacks (29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) in the carotid territory, without any pathological lesions at angiography, with that of a control group of 111 patients with MVP without neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups were not different for age or sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with MVP and neurological complications showed a higher prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0006118'>aortic valve prolapse</z:mp> (62% vs 34%, p less than 0.01), of an association between valvular diffuse thickening and <z:mp ids='MP_0006118'>aortic valve prolapse</z:mp> (54% vs 23%, p = 0.001), and of multiple valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> with valvular diffuse thickening (26% vs 7%, p less than 0.01) than those of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that in young people cerebral ischemic events could be related to the presence of a combined valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> and to an echocardiographic picture of valve diffuse thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that in this selected group with multiple valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> and valvar diffuse thickening prophylaxis against embolic events by pharmacological preventive measures should be considered </plain></SENT>
