<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This procedure is often referred to as the photothrombotic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/ injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently we reported that in this model some cells show signs of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> can be attenuated by inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the work described here, we tested the hypothesis that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> will reduce the actual size of a photothrombotic brain lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten male rats were treated subcutaneously with 2.5 mg kg-1 cycloheximide; 10 rats received saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hour later, a photothrombotic injury was induced in the left cortex in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals; they were sacrificed 24 h after photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nissl staining and computer-assisted analyses were used to assess the volume of the lesion, and to count the Nissl-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both assays revealed significant protective action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In line with previous reports in which we described the occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the model of photothrombotic brain injury our results with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> suggest that this model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> can be used to test the neuroprotective efficacy of putative antiapoptotic compounds </plain></SENT>
