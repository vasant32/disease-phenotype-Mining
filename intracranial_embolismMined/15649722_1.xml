<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate whether a single pre-operative dose of 120 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) decreased either (1) emboli rate, as detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD), during and early after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and (2) clinical intra- and post-operative signs suggestive of embolism or increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind placebo controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One-hundred consecutive patients were randomised to receive either 120 mg <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (n = 48) or placebo (n = 49) by suppository on the night before CEA; three patients were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Emboli were counted and expressed as emboli rate (ER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgeons were asked to indicate which patients had received <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and placebo groups in ER in the intraoperative and postoperative periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ER higher than 0.9 min(-1) was associated with a significantly increased risk of complications (26 vs. 0%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No extra <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications were observed in the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgeon assessment of whether or not <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> had been administered had a sensitivity of 42% and a specificity of 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A single pre-operative dose of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (120 mg) did not reduce significantly the emboli rate during and after CEA and surgeons could not correctly identify whether or not <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> had been administered </plain></SENT>
