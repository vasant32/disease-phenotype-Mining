<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebral embolization, produced by injecting 2000 microspheres into the internal carotid artery, caused a significant impairment in passive avoidance response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeated administrations of idebenone (30 mg/kg/day, i.p.), partially but significantly improved the impairment of the passive avoidance response in the embolized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the repeated administration of idebenone exerts an ameliorating effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> induced by cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
