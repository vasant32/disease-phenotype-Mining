<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Internal medicine outpatient group practice and anticoagulation clinic in 2 teaching hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Seventy-four NVAF patients (24 with and 50 without a history of an embolic event), separated into 3 groups: no prior embolic event and no <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use (group 1), no prior embolic event and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use (group 2), and prior embolic event and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty control subjects in sinus rhythm (29 without and 11 with prior thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma tPA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-adjusted mean tPA levels exceeded the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 NVAF groups but not in the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The NVAF patients had significantly higher mean tPA levels than the control subjects (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels did not differ significantly between the NVAF patients with a history of an embolic event and those without such a history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The control subjects with a history of thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had significantly higher mean tPA levels than the other control subjects (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NVAF patients, regardless of their history of embolic events, and control patients with a history of thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have higher tPA levels than subjects in sinus rhythm without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A prospective, longitudinal study involving NVAF patients is required to determine whether high baseline tPA levels are associated with, and perhaps causally related to, an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
