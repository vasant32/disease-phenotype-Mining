<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy eight per cent of the patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 61.1 +/- 9.6 yrs and mean ejection fraction was 0.59 +/- 0.18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The indications for PTCA were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (53%), post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (26.6%), unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (17.4%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emergency PTCA was performed on 15 cases with 5 patients in cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty four per cent of the cases were performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856737" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">single vessel disease</z:e>, 33 per cent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919945" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">double vessel disease</z:e> and 13 per cent in tripple vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vessels dilated were the left anterior descending artery (44.2%), right coronary artery (27.8%), left circumflex artery (26.7%), left main (0.9%) and saphenous vein graft (0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean balloon size was 2.48 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall success rate of PTCA, defined as residual diameter stenosis less than 50 per cent, was 91.5 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to PTCA, 123 stent implantations with mean stent size 2.98 mm and 15 rotational athrectomy were done in 114 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications of PTCA occurred in 32 cases (6.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (2.2%) had abrupt closure, 1 of these needed emergency coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient (0.2%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with minor residual neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient (0.2%) had toe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> which eventually needed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient (0.2%) who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> extensive anterior wall MI and failure of thrombolytic therapy died 8 hours after successful PTCA due to refractory cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the patients who also had stent implantation, there were 6 stent misplacements: 3 in the right femoral artery without any complication, 2 were misplacements in the coronary system and 1 dislodged in LM necessitating emergency CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PTCA is the coronary interventional procedure that can be performed with a high success rate and minimal complications </plain></SENT>
