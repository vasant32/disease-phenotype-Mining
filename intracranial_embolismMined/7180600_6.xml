<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we discuss the results of a study by light microscope of the effect of permanent clipping or ligation on the intracranial arteries of 38 operation dogs and 7 control dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings obtained are: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral arterial circle, <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> could easily result from ordinary clipping or ligation because of scarce vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As for the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, the greatest was found in the case of the Yaşargil clip after electric coagulation, next came the Yaşargil clip alone, next ligation, and last the silver clip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> correlated with the duration of clipping in the cases treated with a spring type clip, and was influenced more by the closing strength at the time of application in the cases with non-spring type clips or ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some of the cases ligated for long duration, recanalization was caused by the passage of the ligature through the vessel wall, suggesting that ligation is not a certain procedure if it is applied alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> round the clip and ligature began to grow after one month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As for its degree, the most marked granulation was that caused by the silver clip, next the ligature, than the Yaşargil clip after electric coagulation, and finally the Yaşargil clip used normally; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them the correlation with the passage of time was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the group of duration three months or more, concentric intimal proliferation was noted peripheral to the clip, and intimal proliferation was also noted exclusively localized to the side of a branch on the central or truncal side of a clip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This correlated in degree with the passage of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Clipping and ligation are liable to cause <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and fragmentation, but on the other hand it was considered that rupture of the vessel wall did not result because of the reinforcing and reparative effect of the reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> and the intimal proliferation which developed in such a manner as to strengthen the area involved </plain></SENT>
