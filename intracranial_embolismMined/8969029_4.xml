<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nature of Doppler "microembolic" signals is of particular interest in patients with prosthetic heart valves, where a high prevalence of these signals is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monitoring the middle cerebral artery with 2-MHz transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TC-2000, Nicolet Biomedical; Warwick, UK), we looked for microemboli signals in 150 patients (95 women and 55 men), and found 1 or more signals during a 30-min recording in 89% of 70 patients with Bjork-Shiley valves (principally monostrut), 54% of 50 patients with Medtronic-Hall valves, and 50% of 30 patients with Carpentier-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> valves (p &lt; 0.001, chi 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients with Bjork-Shiley valves, the mean number of signals per hour was 59 (range, 42-86; 95% confidence interval), which was significantly higher than the mean in patients with Medtronic-Hall and Carpentier-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> valves (1.5[range, 0.5-2.5] and 1 [range, 0-5.3], respectively; both p &lt; 0.04, multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bonferroni correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients undergoing serial pre- and postoperative studies, the causative role of the valve implant was emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the number of emboli signals and a prior history of neurologic deficit, cardiac rhythm, previous cardiac surgery, or the intensity of oral anticoagulation, in patients with prosthetic heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Bjork-Shiley patients, dual (mitral and aortic) valves were associated with more signals than were single valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Medtronic-Hall patients, the signal count was greater for valves in the aortic position than it was for valves in the mitral position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparative studies of Doppler emboli signals in other clinical settings suggest a difference in composition or size of the underlying maternal between prosthetic valve patients and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies also suggest that the signals are of gaseous origin in valve patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of continuing microembolism remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
