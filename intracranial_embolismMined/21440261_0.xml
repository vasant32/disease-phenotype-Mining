<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of platelets and other blood cells can be different among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic cerebrovascular disease, including 31 patients with large vessel disease, 21 patients with cardioembolic disease, and 20 patients with small vessel disease, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P-selectin (CD62P) expression and platelet leukocyte aggregates were measured with flow cytometry at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after the ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Markers were also measured in 37 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, the serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The platelet-monocyte aggregates (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) and platelet-granulocyte aggregates (<z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi>) in the large vessel disease group were higher than in control group (P=0.002, and P&lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi> in the small vessel disease group were also higher than in the control group (P=0.004 and P&lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the cardioembolic disease group, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi> were not significantly different from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD62P expression was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patient groups relative to the control group (P&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum CRP levels were also higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patient groups than in the control group (P&lt;0.0001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to large vessel and small vessel disease, it seems that platelet-leukocyte association does not play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
