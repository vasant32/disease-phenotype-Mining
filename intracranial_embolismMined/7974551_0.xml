<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although it is often assumed in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies that cautery-induced occlusion is permanent, surgeons commonly expect cauterized vessels to recanalize spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used the rat middle cerebral artery to determine if electrocoagulation would produce a permanent occlusion in this preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A standard bipolar coagulator, calibrated to determine actual power output, was adjusted to induce platelet aggregation in the middle cerebral artery of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats without inducing <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> through the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A reliable temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by a Malis Bipolar Coagulator set to deliver 10 bursts of 1.5 seconds each at a rate of 24 min-1 and a power setting of 3 W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was responsive to the antithrombotic agent flunarizine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An apparently permanent occlusion was produced by 30 bursts at 3 W followed by 20 bursts at 5 W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our surprise, seven of seven such occlusions recanalized spontaneously within 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The electrocoagulation process commonly used in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies may produce only a temporary occlusion of the rat middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
