<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) has been shown to be an effective treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, knowledge of safety and efficacy of IAT in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as a complication of arterial catheter interventions is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed clinical radiological findings and functional outcomes in consecutive patients 3 months after treatment with IAT for peri-procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurring during neuroendovascular or cardiac catheter interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To measure outcome, the modified Rankin scale score was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of a total of 432 patients treated with IAT, 12 (4 women and 8 men; mean age, 60 years) were treated because of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> after a neuro-endovascular procedure (n=6) or coronary angiography (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was complete (thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> grade 3) in 6, partial (thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> 2) in 5, and minimal (thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> 1) in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (75%) had a favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale score, 0 to 2), and 3 had a poor outcome (modified Rankin scale score, 3 or 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with complete recanalization had a favorable outcome, whereas only 3 of 6 patients with partial or minimal recanalization (P=0.18) had a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up brain imaging was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 2 and showed new ischemic lesions in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (17%) had a symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributable to arterial catheter interventions, IAT is feasible and has the potential to improve outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A high recanalization rate could be achieved </plain></SENT>
