<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk within 30 days of endovascular treatment or endarterectomy for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: systematic comparison of the 30-day outcome of angioplasty with or without stenting and endarterectomy for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> reported in single-center studies, published since 1990, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three studies (13 angioplasty and 20 carotid endarterectomy) were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid stents were deployed in 44% of angioplasty patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality within 30 days of angioplasty was 0.8% compared with 1.2% after endarterectomy (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.05; P=0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 7.1% for angioplasty and 3.3% for endarterectomy (OR 2.22, CI 1.62 to 3.04; P&lt;0.001), while the risk of fatal or disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 3.2% and 1.6%, respectively (OR 2.09, CI 1.3 to 3.33; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 7.8% for angioplasty and 4% for endarterectomy (OR 2.02, CI 1.49 to 2.75; P&lt;0.001), while disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 3.9% after angioplasty and 2.2% after endarterectomy (OR 1.86, CI 1.22 to 2.84; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is significantly greater with angioplasty than carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At present, carotid angioplasty is not recommended for the majority of patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
