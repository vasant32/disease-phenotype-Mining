<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 95 patients aged 50 years or under who were admitted with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> over a 2-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients underwent complete clinical and laboratory assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The etiology was established in 73 (76.8%) out of 95 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, embolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were found to be the most frequent causes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture were the most prevailing etiologies in patients with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Miscellaneous causes represented one fourth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>Coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> occurred in some patients, but in these cases there were also other well established causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Paradoxical embolism</z:e> was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study corroborates the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation to establish an accurate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
