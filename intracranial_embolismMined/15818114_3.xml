<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of hyperbaric oxygen treatment after cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> on intracranial pressure, brain oxygenation, brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> metabolism, and electroencephalograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective animal study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Hyperbaric chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Eleven Landrace/Yorkshire pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: In 11 anesthetized pigs, intracranial pressure and brain oxygenation were measured with microsensor technology, brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> by microdialysis, and electroencephalograph by conventional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After injection of air into the internal carotid artery, animals were treated immediately (at 3 mins; t = 3) or at 60 mins (t = 60) with U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Navy Treatment Table 6 for 4.48 hrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of hyperbaric oxygen treatment, intracranial pressure in the t = 60 group (39 +/- 8 mm Hg) was significantly higher than in the t = 3 group (27 +/- 6 mm Hg), brain oxygenation values for group t = 3 and t = 60 were 66 +/- 14 and 52 +/- 15 mm Hg, respectively (no significant difference from baseline), and there were no pathologic scores in the visually assessed electroencephalograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant decrease in brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and a significant increase in brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> in both groups at the end of the 5-hr study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hyperbaric oxygen treatment initiated at both 3 and 60 mins after embolization decreased the deleterious effects of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> on intracranial pressure and brain metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this model appears suitable to test the application of hyperbaric oxygen treatment with a delay &gt;60 mins after embolization, as is often the case in the clinical situation </plain></SENT>
