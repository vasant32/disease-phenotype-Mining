<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 5.5% of 90 hospitalized patients showed foci of calcification in routine films </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But foci of calcification were seen in 22% of the soft tissue radiographs of the whole series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the autopsy part of the study large foci of calcification were found at the carotid bifurcations in 12 out of 20 cadavers by radiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an additional five cases contact radiographs also showed smaller foci of calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vascular endothelium over the calcification was often ulcerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The significance of the large arterial foci of calcification demonstrated in the neck radiographs as a sign of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and as a source of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
