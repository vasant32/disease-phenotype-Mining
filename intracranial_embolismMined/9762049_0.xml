<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Increasing numbers of vena canal filters are being implanted to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, which are mainly the consequence of deep vein and pelvic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>Can a filter be removed again in case of complications arising from it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>What is the risk of such operative explantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>What is the subsequent risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In nine patients (5 males, 4 females; mean age 45 (30-39 years) who had vena caval filters implanted because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> despite anticoagulation, complications due to the filter required its operative removal and thrombectomy of the large veins 3 days to 48 months after implantation in the inferior vena cava (IVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One inguinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of rods of a displaced filter) were closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients' case note were retrospectively analysed and eight of the nine patients' were reexamined according to a standardized procedure a mean of 20 months after removal of the filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Explantation of the filter had been successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But there were two nonfatal postoperative complications: a pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and a paradoxical cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient a segmental stenosis of the IVC with retroperitoneal collateral circulation was found at operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one of 16 pelvic veins that had thrombectomies performed at the time of filter explanation were patent, as were the IVCs in seven of the eight re-examined patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had evidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vena caval filters can be explanted with a low operative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After removal and venous thrombectomy, implantation of another caval filter is unnecessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As anticoagulation properly monitored is almost always an effective measure in the prevention of pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, filter implantation should be performed only on the strictest indication, as an ultimate step </plain></SENT>
