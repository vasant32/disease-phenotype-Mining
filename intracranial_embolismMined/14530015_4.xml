<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, brain metabolism and outcome have been evaluated in a surviving model of experimental hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty pigs undergoing 75-minutes of hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> at a brain temperature of 18 degrees C were randomly assigned to the alpha-stat (n = 10) or pH-stat (n = 10) strategy during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 7-day survival rate was 90% (9 of 10) in the pH-stat group and 10% (1 of 10) in the alpha-stat group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of cooling, pH-stat strategy was associated with significantly lower brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> concentrations and brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, brain concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio were significantly lower in the pH-stat group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This strategy was associated with a faster rise of brain tissue temperature and reoxygenation on reperfusion, which is likely secondary to improved cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During cardiopulmonary bypass before and after a period of hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, acid-base management according to the pH-stat principles seemed to be associated with less derangements in cerebral metabolism, lower intracranial pressures, and excellent behavioral recovery and survival outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because there is strong evidence of the beneficial metabolic effects related to this method, further studies using an experimental model of combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> and embolic brain injury are required to exclude a possible increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> associated with the pH-stat strategy </plain></SENT>
