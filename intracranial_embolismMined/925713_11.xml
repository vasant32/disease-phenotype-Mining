<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two patients presenting with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of bilateral parietal lobe damage showed initially the features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270706" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Balint's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After most of its manifestations had cleared, both patients exhibited severe disorders of spatial orientation: acoustic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, inability to localize objects in space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, 1 patient showed a topographical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> and abnormalities of whole body movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This patient came to post-mortem examination, which revealed bilateral and fairly symmetrical old and recent infarctions of the superior parietal lobules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the light of these observations and previous reports, it is suggested that the reported abnormalities of whole body movements can be explained on the basis of a visuo-motor intrahemispheric disconnection due to the bilateral lesion of the dorsal parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the global spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> is analysed and is thought to be the manifestation of a derangement of a specific function centered in the parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is pointed out that topographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> does not require the concomitant failure of oculomotor mechanisms for its production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The topography of the anatomical lesion is considered in relation to current concepts on brain damage after severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that this group of patients is most likely at risk of developing behavioural abnormalities akin to the ones here reported </plain></SENT>
