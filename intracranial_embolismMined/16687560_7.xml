<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the feasibility, safety, and 1-month results of performing stent placement for vertebral origin stenosis with the use of a distal protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distal protection devices have been shown to reduce the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and subsequent ischemic events when used as adjuncts to percutaneous carotid intervention; however, one case of the use of a distal protection device for vertebral artery has been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively determined rates of technical success and 1-month <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> associated with stent placement by using distal protection (Filter EX; Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass) in patients with symptomatic vertebral artery origin stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Technical success was defined as successful deployment of distal protection device and stent at target lesion followed by successful retrieval of the device and a final residual stenosis of less than 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other outcomes ascertained included any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and semiquantitative assessment of particulate material retained by the filter device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the 12 treated patients was 68 years (range, 52-88 years) and the group included 9 men and 3 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean percentage of vertebral artery origin stenosis was 71 +/- 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Femoral and radial approaches were used in 9 and 3 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Technical success was achieved in 11 of the 12 patients in whom distal protection device placement was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postprocedure residual stenosis was 5 +/- 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight devices held macroscopically visible embolic debris (large and small amounts in 3 and 5 devices, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed in the 1-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the feasibility of performing stent placement for vertebral artery origin stenosis by using a distal protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to determine the effectiveness of this approach for vertebral artery origin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
