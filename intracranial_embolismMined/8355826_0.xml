<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the histopathology of Gelfoam on the cerebral vasculature, 42 Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 to 300 g received internal carotid artery infusions of 0.3 ml of Gelfoam solution (5 mg/ml) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed at 1 hour, 5 hours, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brains were removed, sectioned, and stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Examination of brain sections revealed Gelfoam emboli lodged primarily in the small leptomeningeal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 5 hours after infusion, inflammatory cells were noted in the arterial walls with vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further canalization of vessels was noted at 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 4 weeks, Gelfoam was not seen in the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that Gelfoam acts as an embolic agent in vessels over short periods of time with no residual inflammatory activity postinfusion </plain></SENT>
