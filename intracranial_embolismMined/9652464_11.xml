<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 76 patients who underwent 78 carotid endarterectomies at a referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perioperative transcranial Doppler monitoring and MRI were performed before and after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The types of MS that occurred during phases of surgery were analyzed and compared with MRI changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in one patient (1.3%) and ipsilateral small areas of silent ischemic change on seven postoperative MRI studies (9.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 95% of CEAs, MS were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only those MS observed in the recovery room that occurred at a rate of more than five per 15 minutes were associated with postoperative MRI ischemic changes (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic changes on MRI after CEA are related to postoperative MS </plain></SENT>
