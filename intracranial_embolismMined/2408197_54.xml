<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to define the signal characteristics and clinical circumstances associated with emboli detected in the middle cerebral artery using 2-MHz pulsed transcranial Doppler ultrasound in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Signals designating emboli were transients displaying harmonic qualities the signatures of which were clearly different from those of mechanical and electronic artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the audio/video tape recordings from 91 patients for signals of air bubble emboli occurring upon release of common carotid artery crossclamps; recordings from 35 patients (38%) demonstrated air bubble emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transients with signatures identical to those of air bubble emboli were also discovered when bubbles in the bloodstream were improbable; we defined these transients as representing formed-element emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such signals were found in recordings from 24 patients (26%), and they occurred before (both spontaneously and upon common carotid artery compression), during, and after surgical dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Signals indicating formed-element emboli were associated with intraluminal platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, with ulcerations in the carotid artery, and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most postoperative formed-element emboli did not cause symptoms but, when persisting for hours, they were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This Doppler ultrasound method of detecting emboli will be useful in the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms and as a clinical test to guide the medical and surgical treatment of patients at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
