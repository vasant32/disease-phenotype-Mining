<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective study, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) before and after intra-arterial cerebral angiography and transcranial Doppler sonography during angiography were used to evaluate the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty diagnostic cerebral angiographies were randomized into 50 procedures, each using conventional angiographic technique, or systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment throughout the procedure, or air filters between the catheter and both the contrast medium syringe and the catheter flushing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no neurological complication during or after angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, DW-MRI revealed 26 new ischemic lesions in 17 patients (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control group, 11 patients showed a total of 18 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group, 3 patients showed a total of 4 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the air filter group, 3 patients exhibited a total of 4 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduced incidence of ischemic events in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and air filter groups compared with the control group was significantly different (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler sonography demonstrated a large number of microembolic signals that was significantly lower in the air filter group compared with the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and control groups (P&lt;0.01), which did not differ from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Air filters and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> both reduce the incidence of silent ischemic events detected by DW-MRI after intra-arterial cerebral angiography and can potentially lower clinically overt ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may apply to any intra-arterial angiographic procedure </plain></SENT>
