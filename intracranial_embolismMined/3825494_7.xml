<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight recent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were studied histologically for the presence of zones of partial tissue destruction between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border and the surrounding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such transitional zones have been demonstrated in animals and might be suspected in humans from the broad zones of reduced blood flow that have been demonstrated around brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Necrotic neurons were observed outside the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> borders in 20 of 28 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the width of the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone was less than 5 mm in 17 of 20 cases and between 7 and 10 mm in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one section from one case showed necrotic neurons more than 20 mm from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the large majority of the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in man are sharply delimited and that the broad zones of reduced flow around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may be due to functional inactivity following partial denervation of the cortex rather than to true <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
