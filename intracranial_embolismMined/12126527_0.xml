<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-six patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) were treated by Cox/maze III procedure combined with MVR (maze group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another 56 age, sex, and heart function-matched patients with the same diagnosis underwent MVR alone during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> was administered after operation in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of operative complication and curative effects was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The aortic cross-clamp time and cardio pulmonary bypass time (CPB) were longer in maze group than in MVT group (75 +/- 22 min vs 41 +/- 11 min, P &lt; 0.05 and 124 +/- 40 min VS 68 +/- 19 min, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> happened after the heart reatored beating in 2 patients in maze group and in one patient in MVT group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these 3 patients responding satisfactorily to hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The early post-operative mortality was 1.79% (1/56) in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In maze group, AF disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but one who had node rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm was restored in 98.18% of the patients (54/55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Atrial contractility was restored in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One year after operation, 98.18% patients' cardiac function changed to grade and 1.82% changed to grade II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In MVR group AF disappeared after operation temporarily for 24 hours in 7 patients and re-appeared, and AF disappeared in one patients for 2 years so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One year after operation, the cardiac function of 94.6% patients in MVR group changed to grade I, of 3.6% patients to grade II, and of 1.8% patients to grade III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No serious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> relate d to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy happened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One patient in MVR group suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The late mortality was 1.8% on maze group amd 3.6% in MVR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cox/maze III procedure combined with NVR is safe and effective in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> with AF </plain></SENT>
