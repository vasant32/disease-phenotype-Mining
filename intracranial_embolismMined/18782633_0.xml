<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a methodological novelty, it is shown that this task can be effectively solved by transforming it to a more common and well-understood subgroup discovery task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transformation is studied in two learning settings, a one-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> and a pairwise contrast set mining setting, uncovering the conditions for each of the two choices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the paper shows that the explanatory potential of discovered contrast sets can be improved by offering additional contrast set descriptors, called the supporting factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proposed methodology has been applied to uncover distinguishing characteristics of two groups of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, both with rapidly developing loss of brain function due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>:those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and by embolism, respectively </plain></SENT>
