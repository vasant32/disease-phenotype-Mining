<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship of an intraoperatively recorded ultrasound turbulence index (TI) during CEA and the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Short-time <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection was performed on 164 patients (mean age 64 years, 140 males) in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery within 2 h after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A specialized continuous-wave ultrasound Doppler probe measured the TI within the reconstructed internal carotid artery during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The occurrence of postoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> increased significantly with the TI: a TI &gt;26 predicted <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> with a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> rate and TI were higher in patients operated with the eversion technique than in patients operated with the patch technique (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship with preoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, site of surgery or age of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Female patients had a higher risk of postoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> than males (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Simplified intraoperative Doppler sonography or short-time <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection after CEA are feasible, and may be helpful for surgical quality control and decision making (e.g. treatment with platelet <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
