<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> during PBMV has been reported to be less than 5% and only 0.6% with the Inoue technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is less than that reported in closed commissurotomy series and about the same as in open commissurotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the authors' series of 50 cases, the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> was 2% (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340361" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral restenosis</z:e> (after closed commissurotomy) with mild to moderate valvular and subvalvular calcification, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> occurred during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To prevent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath>, the authors' standard policy was to perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging before the procedure and to give <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during the procedure and two months preceding it in cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or with a history of previous embolism and to limit manipulation of the catheter in the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors believe that a close scrutiny in the selection of patients, improved technology of the dilating system, good experience with PBMV, and adequate heparinization are also of great importance in the prevention of thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
