<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 43 of the patients a precise diagnosis was obtained and in those with proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> the mean extent of the release reaction was significantly higher than for those with either primary haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enhanced platelet reactivity was also found in the patients in whom a precise diagnosis could not be obtained, most of whom probably had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The part that abnormalities of platelet behaviour, whether causal or consequential, might play in occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and intra-cranial haemorrhage is discussed and the need for large scale prospective studies is emphasised </plain></SENT>
