<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We addressed these problems by simultaneously using transcranial Doppler ultrasound and contrast echocardiography to compare relative sensitivity and concordance in the detection of right-to-left vascular shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, transient neurologic defect, or question of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> underwent study at rest and during Valsalva strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional echocardiography detected shunting in 26% at rest and 15% during Valsalva strain, whereas transcranial Doppler study returned rates of 41% and 41%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concordance was 82% and 75%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discordant studies almost always had evidence of paradoxical contrast embolization by transcranial Doppler and intermediate findings by two-dimensional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler is a sensitive, unambiguous technique for the detection of anatomic substrates and target organ involvement in patients suspected to have paradoxical cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
