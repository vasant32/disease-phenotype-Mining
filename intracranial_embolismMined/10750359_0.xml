<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is no consensus whether this test is of any value in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to examine the value of ACZ challenge test in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study 1: Nineteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were subjected to the Xe CT with and without ACZ (17 mg/kg, i.v.) within 6 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cases included 12 middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusions and 7 internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) values and cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) (% increase in CBF after ACZ) were analyzed in 53 affected regions of interest (ROI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study indicated that the CBF threshold of subsequent permanent infarction was 15 ml/100 g/min and the ROI with negative CVR had a higher incidence of hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Study 2: Xe-CT with and without ACZ was performed in 32 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the main trunks of cerebral arteries within 6 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occluded arteries were <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in 20 patients, ICA in 7, both ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in 4 and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The abnormal hemispheric CBF (&lt; 20 ml/100 g/min) and CVR (&lt; 10%) were correlated with the Glasgow outcome scales of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The predictability of Good Recovery, Moderately Disabled, Severely Disabled, Vegetative Survival and Dead were 80%, 50%, 50%, 100% and 100% by CBF criteria, and 80%, 60%, 80%, 100% and 100% by CVR criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant increase in the predictability of final outcome of the patients by adding the CVR information of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ACZ challenge test has a potential value in the prediction of hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It does not increase the predictability of the long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We do not recommend performing ACZ challenge test on routine basis in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
