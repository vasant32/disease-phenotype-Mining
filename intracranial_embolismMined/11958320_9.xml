<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To present a 2-device technique for cerebral protection during carotid stenting of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in patients with high-grade lesions, contralateral occlusion, and/or an aberrant or nonfunctioning circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: A reverse flow system (Parodi Anti-Embolism System [PAES]) is first placed with a 260-cm exchange wire in the common carotid artery 3 cm below the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow reversal is obtained by inflating the balloons in the external and common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Via an external connector, a guidewire and E-Trap filter are delivered to the distal ICA with active suction from a syringe on the PAES catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Once the filter is above the stenosis, the reversed flow is discontinued, and the procedure proceeds under cerebral protection with the filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 2 existing cerebral protection devices could, at least in theory, achieve what neither of them could independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The "seat belt and air bag" approach may represent the ideal means of treating ICA stenoses in patients with a non-functioning circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
