<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Embolism is believed to be the major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (NVAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The detection of asymptomatic embolic signals (ES) in individuals with NVAF might allow identification of patients at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and monitoring of therapy in individual subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the frequency of asymptomatic ES in patients with NVAF who were not taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bilateral transcranial Doppler recordings were made for 1 hour from the middle cerebral arteries of 111 successive patients with NVAF taking aspirin alone or no antithrombotic or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adequate recordings could be made in 86 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 79 subjects, recordings were performed on a second occasion to study temporal variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recordings for a single hour were also made in 30 age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ES were detected in 13 (15.1%) of NVAF subjects but in no control subjects (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ES were detected both in subjects with symptomatic NVAF (4 of 30 [13.1%], P=0.04 versus controls) and asymptomatic NVAF (9 of 56 [16.1%], P=0.02 versus controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the presence of ES and smoking status, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, aspirin use, aspirin dose, symptomatic status, left atrial size, left ventricular function, or the presence of left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> detected on transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Repeating the recording increased the number of patients with ES to 21 (26.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On considering the results of both recordings, again there was no association for either recording between the presence of ES and smoking status, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, aspirin use, aspirin dose, age, symptomatic status, left atrial size, or left ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On repeating the recording, in the symptomatic group only 2 patients (8%) changed status, in contrast to 15 (29%) in the asymptomatic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ES can be detected in patients with NVAF at a low frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Particularly in asymptomatic patients, ES show marked temporal variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We found no correlation between the presence of previously reported clinical and echocardiographic markers of increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk and the presence of ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This association requires further investigation before the clinical utility of this technique in patients with NVAF is decided </plain></SENT>
