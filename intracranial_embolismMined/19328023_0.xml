<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The administration of unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (UFH) prior to carotid clamping during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) transiently increases the platelet aggregation response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA) despite the use of aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that this phenomenon might be reduced by using low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) resulting in fewer emboli in the early post-operative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 183 aspirinated patients undergoing CEA were randomised to 5000 IU UFH (n=91) or 2500 IU LMWH (dalteparin, n=92) prior to carotid clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End-points were: transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurement of embolisation, effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and platelet aggregation to AA and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients randomised to UFH had twice the odds of experiencing a higher number of emboli in the first 3h after CEA, than those randomised to LMWH (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was not associated with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (mean time from flow restoration to operation end: 23 min (UFH) vs. 24 min (LMWH), p=0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation to AA increased significantly following heparinisation, but was unaffected by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> type (p=0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The platelets of patients randomised to LMWH exhibited significantly lower aggregation to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> compared to UFH (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous LMWH is associated with a significant reduction in post-operative embolisation without increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The higher rate of embolisation seen with UFH may be mediated by <z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>increased platelet aggregation</z:mp> to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, rather than to AA </plain></SENT>
