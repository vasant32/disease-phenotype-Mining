<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aphasic and non-brain-damaged adults participated in several tasks designed to test their knowledge of scripts for common situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The tasks included discrimination, in which subjects separated printed phrases identifying test scripts from phrases identifying foil scripts, centrality judgment, in which subjects identified the most typical and frequently occurring events in test scripts, and sequencing, in which subjects arranged the central events from test scripts in the order in which they would be expected to occur in the scripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Error rates for both non-brain-damaged and aphasic subjects were low in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three tasks, and aphasic subjects generally performed as well as non-brain-damaged subjects did, except that aphasic subjects were significantly poorer at sequencing central events from scripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the actual differences between groups in the sequencing task were quite small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that knowledge of scripts is not seriously compromised by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, at least when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> is mild to moderate </plain></SENT>
