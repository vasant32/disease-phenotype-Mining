<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> decreases the risk of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by &gt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of genetic polymorphisms in enzymes involved in the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> can partially predict the maintenance dose and thus potentially decrease the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes secondary to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> overdose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential clinical and economic outcomes of genotype-guided <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy in elderly patients newly diagnosed with AF and to identify a threshold in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk at which such therapy may be cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A decision tree was designed to represent the medical decision (pharmacogenetic testing or not) and the main clinical outcomes (embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Event rates of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications were based on data from previously published clinical trials and an observational study, respectively; costs were from a third-party payer perspective; and utilities were from the patient perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was assumed that use of pharma-cogenetic testing would not lead the clinician to make any potentially harmful modifications to the regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This analysis found that any reduction in major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> as a result of pharmacogenetic testing would lead to improved utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The higher costs of pharmacogenetic testing compared with no testing would be immediately offset by any reduction in major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this decision analysis, genotype-guided <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy for anticoagulation in elderly patients with AF was potentially cost-effective, and its benefits were closely related to efficacy in preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials testing the efficacy of genotype-guided <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy are warranted </plain></SENT>
