<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study clarified that positive scans could be obtained in the patients with and without recanalization, and emphasized the diagnostic value of brain scans in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, especially in patients with no <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> appearing on the angiograms </plain></SENT>
