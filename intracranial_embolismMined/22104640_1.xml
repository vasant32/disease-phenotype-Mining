<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, it was shown that the relation between admission <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is described by a J-shaped curve, with a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> range of 3.7-7.3 mmol/l associated with a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that persistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> above this threshold at 24-48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> impairs 3-month functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;7.3 mmol/l on admission from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> STroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level at 24-48 h after last well-being time (group 1: ≤7.3 mmol/l, group 2: &gt;7.3 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A favorable functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Score (mRS) ≤2 at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multiple logistic regression analysis of multiple demographic, clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging covariates was performed to assess predictors of an unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,984 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were admitted between January 1, 2003 and October 20, 2009, within 24 h after last well-being time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 421 patients (21.2%) with admission <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;7.3 mmol/l, the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome was not statistically significantly different between the two groups (59.2 vs. 48.7%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multiple logistic regression analysis, unfavorable outcome was significantly associated with age (odds ratio, OR: 1.06, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI: 1.03-1.08 for every 10-year increase), National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Score, NIHSS score, on admission (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11-1.21), prehospital mRS (OR: 12.63, 95% CI: 2.61-61.10 for patients with score &gt;0), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242510" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drug usage</z:e> (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.15-0.86) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> on admission (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.02-1.31 for every 1 mmol/l increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association was found between persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> at 24-28 h and outcome in either diabetics or nondiabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (&gt;7.3 mmol/l) at 24-48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is not associated with a worse functional outcome at 3 months whether the patient was previously diabetic or not </plain></SENT>
