<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors report the results observed in a series of 11 consecutive patients (7 men, mean age 72 +/- 9 years) in whom this procedure was proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> for over 3 months, were at high risk and had contra-indications to oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The implantation of the prosthesis was performed after treatment with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, under general anaesthesia radioscopy and transoesophageal echocardiographic guidance with success in 9 cases (1 implantation refused in the catheter laboratory and 1 failure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only complication observed was transient ST elevation treated by emergency angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The echographic and angiographic criteria of success of left atrial appendage exclusion were fulfilled in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> implanted patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was observed at the second month: transoesophageal echocardiography confirmed the absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, of migration of the prosthesis and its impermeability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
