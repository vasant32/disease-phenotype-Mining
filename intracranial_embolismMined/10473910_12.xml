<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients and Methods: Three groups of a consecutive series of 71 emergency CEAs performed from 1980 to July 1998 were classified: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 16), (2) progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in evolution (n = 34), and (3) crescendo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, cerebral haemorrhage, and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> established in cranial computed tomography scans were contraindications for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival and long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrences were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: The recovery/minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates (Rankin 0-3) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and crescendo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> were 56.3, 76.4 and 80.9%, respectively; the combined major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/mortality rates (Rankin 4-6) were 43.7, 23.6 and 19.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative angiography in 39 patients detected early carotid reocclusions in 2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial embolism</z:e> in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local application of thrombolytic agents (n = 5) may contribute to a better neurological outcome in emergency CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Life table probabilities of major strokefree survival were 74.5, 71.6, and 53.7% after 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively (including perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Life table probabilities to suffer no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence during follow-up were 96.7, 96.7 and 85.3%, respectively (perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> excluded) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Emergency CEA may be worthwhile in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Completion angiography is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Emergency CEA should be included in therapeutic strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
