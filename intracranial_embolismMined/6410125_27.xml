<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marked changes occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and significant correlation with temperature and plasma PCO2 (p less than 0.01) support the reliability of the method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean CBF measured between sternotomy and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of extracorporeal circulation (ECC) was 38 ml/100 gm . min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first minute of ECC was associated with a decrease in CBF in nine of 12 patients (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During steady-state hypothermic ECC (temperature 29 degrees C), CBF increased unexpectedly to 64 ml/100 gm . min (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following rewarming steady-state normothermic ECC, mean CBF decreased to 42 ml/100 gm . min with signs of impairment of cerebral autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten and 20 minutes after termination of ECC, mean CBF was 40 and 41 ml/100 gm . min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arterial PCO2 was found to be important in regulating CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cerebral autoregulation maintained CBF down to arterial pressures of around 55 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Below this level, CBF was significantly correlated with perfusion pressure (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple small emboli with a hyperemic border zone could cause a brain hyperperfusion, as seen in our patients during bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Measurements of CBF during ECC hold promise as a guide toward safer cardiac operations </plain></SENT>
