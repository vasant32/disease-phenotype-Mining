<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Concern regarding the safety of stent implantation in the carotid artery exists because of the risk of cerebral embolization during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the incidence of new areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, as detected by using diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging after stent implantation in the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain was performed in 67 patients with 70 high-grade stenoses of the carotid artery before and 24 hours after stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurologic status of the patients was unchanged after 69 of 70 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During one procedure, symptomatic cerebral embolization occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images showed new ipsilateral lesions after stent implantation in 20 patients (29%), including the symptomatic patient, and new contralateral lesions in six patients (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two of 59 postprocedural lesions occurred in the vascular territory supplied by the treated vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of new postprocedural ipsilateral lesions was not significantly correlated with patient demographic data, characteristics of the stenoses, or details of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In 29% of the procedures, stent implantation in the carotid artery was associated with new areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, as detected by using diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images; these findings indicated the occurrence of cerebral microemboli during such procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except one, the new lesions were clinically silent </plain></SENT>
