<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term results of AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty four patients (pts) with sinus node disease (28 male and 36 female: mean age 54.2; range: 44-88 years), 3.2% of the total implantation at our clinic were treated with AP between 1982-96 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Criteria for atrial pacing were: no <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> in the history, no <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV-block</z:mp> during carotid sinus massage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264907" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wenckebach</z:e> point &gt; 130/min, left atrium &lt; 50 mm, left ventricular EF &gt; 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indication for pacing was predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> (SB) in 34 pts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>) in 30 pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pts with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> were on antiarrhythmic treatment, while most pts with SB received no antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the pts were checked up at every 3-6 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two pts were followed for 3-154 (mean: 67) months, two pts were lost for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeated lead dislodgment occurred in two pts, which made a pacing mode change necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four pts died during the follow-up period for non-cardiac reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up period the data of 60 pts were available for evaluation (33 pts with SB, 27 pts with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the pts with SB were in sinus rhythm, and no patient developed <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> by the end of the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven out of 27 pts with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, 3 out of them suffered a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>; the remaining 20 pts were in sinus rhythm, and the number of paroxysmal attacks decreased significantly, which improved their quality of life significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three pts in this group developed a temporary complete <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp>, which regressed with decreasing the dosage of antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Atrial pacing is proved to be a safe and reliable treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Proper patient selection is crucial in preventing the development of AV conduction disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Atrial stimulation had a satisfactory long-term antiarrhythmic effect in pts with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> (SSS) </plain></SENT>
