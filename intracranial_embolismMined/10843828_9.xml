<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS ANd RESULTS: In the 424 patients, event-free survival rates 5 and 10 years after aortic valve replacement were 62% and 37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The linearized incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> was 4.4% per patient-year, and of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-related haemorrhage 8.5% per patient-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Advanced NYHA functional class, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> prior to surgery decreased event-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A history of pre-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> increased the risk for a first embolic event after aortic valve replacement (relative hazard [RH] 3.2), but was even more strongly associated with the risk for repeated events (&gt; or =2 events, RH 5.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After each thromboembolic episode that occurred, the risk for a subsequent one was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk for at least one, and up to three or more haemorrhages was increased in patients with a pre-operative history of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (RH 3.3-5.1) and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (RH 1.8-3.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk for a subsequent event was increased by a history of repeated haemorrhages, a short interval since previous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and high age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were few factors strongly related to valve related morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, previous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were powerful risk factors for repeated events </plain></SENT>
