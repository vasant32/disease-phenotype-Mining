<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its pathological mechanism remains ambiguous despite several investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Case 1, a 67-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>) experienced neurological deficits soon after undergoing a fourth session of TACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple hyperdense lesions along the gyrus of frontal lobes and in the subcortical white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and transesophageal echocardiogram performed during the intravenous injection of agitated saline documented the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) by demonstrating microbubbles in the left middle cerebral artery and left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Case 2, a 63-year-old woman underwent a third TACE due to a large <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, her mental status deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain CT showed multiple hyperdense lesions on the cerebral and cerebellar cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TCD with agitated saline showed multiple microembolic signals shortly after the injection of agitated saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of cerebral lipiodol embolism may increase with recurrence and progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> in patients who have a pre-existing RLS in the heart or lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A test for the detection of an RLS may be necessary to identify patients with a heightened risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> when multiple TACE procedures are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TACE for <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> or infarction.(1,2) However, cerebral lipiodol embolism is rare after TACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There have been several reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> after TACE, but their exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We report herein 2 patients who developed cerebral lipiodol embolism after undergoing multiple TACE procedures for remnant <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> through a pre-existing RLS </plain></SENT>
