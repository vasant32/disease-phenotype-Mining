<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the risks and benefits of antiplatelet therapy (AG) against the resumption of anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (AVK) in a series of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in anticoagulated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We registered demographic data, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HT), time of follow-up and new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebral vascular events</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> [IC]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We evaluated 88 patients, mean age 69±9 years, 50% men, 73% hypertensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase 18 patients died and the follow-up was lost in 31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining (n=39), AVKs were resumed in 25 and changed to AG in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparing the characteristics of both groups, the anticoagulated group was younger (P=.005) and the embolic sources were more often of higher risk (P=.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After an average follow-up of 54±31 months, the distribution of events was: IC (AVKs 8%, AG 14.3%, P=.6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (AVKs 24%, AG 7.1%, P=.38), IC or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (AVKs 32%, AG 21.4%, P=.48) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (AVKs 29%, AG 7.1%, P=.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This trend of increased risk of new events in patients with AVKs was confirmed by Kaplan-Meier curves, although without statistical differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Restarting AVK treatment after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in anticoagulated patients could increase the risk of new <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed to define a better and appropriate antithrombotic therapy after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> related with anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
