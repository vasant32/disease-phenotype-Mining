<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of each response component were correlated with postmortem or radiologic localization of different brain stem lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that waves I-VII largely reflect activity at the following levels of the auditory pathway: acoustic nerve (I), pontomedullary junction (II), caudal pons (III), rostral pons or midbrain (IV), midbrain (V), thalamus (VI), and thalamus or auditory radiation (VII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When this information was applied prospectively to the evaluation of brain stem dysfunction, response abnormalities proved useful in detecting and localizing certain lesions not revealed by other tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial recordings provided information about the evolution of brain stem lesions and their response to therapy </plain></SENT>
