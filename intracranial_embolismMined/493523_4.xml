<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A series of cases in which this phenomenon has occurred is documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since many of these examples present embolic disease without suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, definitive diagnosis can only be accomplished by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The importance of this study should be emphasized since embolic disease is usually assessed only by computed tomography which fails to delineate the embolic source </plain></SENT>
