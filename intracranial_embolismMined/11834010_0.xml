<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study determined whether an endoaortic baffle catheter (Cardeon Cobra Catheter; Cardeon Corporation, Cupertino, CA) could substantially reduce cerebral embolization in a swine cardiopulmonary bypass model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen 60 kg pigs underwent cardiopulmonary bypass; 8 animals with the Cobra baffle (Cardeon Corporation, Cupertino, CA) deployed, and 8 with the same cannula without baffle deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were embolized with 72,000 fluorescent microspheres (97 to 100 microm) at normothermia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiment, the brains were removed and microspheres were isolated from eight regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During embolization, the two groups were equivalent with regard to pump flow, mean arterial pressure, temperature, Hgb and PaCO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deployment of the Cobra baffle reduced embolization to every brain region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deployment of the baffle reduced total brain embolization by 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a mean of 61+/-60 emboli per gram in the control animals and 7+/-24 emboli per gram in those animals in which the baffle was deployed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral embolization is profoundly reduced by use of the Cobra baffle aortic cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The application of this device may reduce postcardiac surgical neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
