<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An experimental model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem ischemia</z:e> was developed by embolization technique with cylindrical <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> rubber emboli in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> reached the basilar artery in 55 cats (58.5%) and stopped in the upper basilar artery (UB) in 32, the middle basilar artery (MB) in 22 and the lower basilar artery (LB) in one animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the basilar artery distal to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was not visualized (type 1) by postoperative vertebral angiogram, Evans blue extravasation was observed in the brainstem caudal to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When only a filling defect of the basilar artery at the site of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was noted (type 2), dye extravasation was observed in the brainstem around the site of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In UB type 1, the regional cerebral blood flow of pons and medulla oblongata decreased immediately after embolization, and six hours after embolization it was 11.4 +/- 5.7 (pons) and 11.7 +/- 4.6 ml/100 g/min (medulla oblongata) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In UB type 1 and MB type 1 animals, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo>, and disturbance of swallowing were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These animals died within 50 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals of UB type 2 and MB type 2 showed neurological deficits, but survived for three days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This paper discusses this method of producing experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem ischemia</z:e>, the sites of ischemic lesions, and clinicopathological findings </plain></SENT>
