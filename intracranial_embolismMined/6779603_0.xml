<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emphasis is placed on the involvement of large cerebral vessels, especially as reflected by cerebral vein or sinus occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter occurred in four of the six cases reported; deep or superficial veins, larger lobar draining veins such as the superficial middle cerebral vein, or large bore vessels such as the superior sagittal sinus or jugular bulb were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radionuclide sinography or computed tomography (CT) was useful in revealing large vessel occlusions or their sequelae; in two cases CT showed focal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in an unusual location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> has classically been envisioned as occurring within the arterial microcirculation, these cases attest to the occurrence of large vessel, especially venous, involvement in neurovascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
