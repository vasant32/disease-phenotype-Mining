<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and four patients with ECI were matched with 71 patients with LI and with 90 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the initial analysis disclosed multiple factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, the analysis with control of the factors revealed that the only factors related with the occurrence of atherothrombotic infarction were: arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> [odds ratio (OR) = 6.8], <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR = 5.6), ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> (OR = 5.5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001899'>increased hematocrit</z:hpo> value (OR = 3.0), and atherogenic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in patients without arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> nor <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> appeared as the only factor specifically associated with LI when compared with ECI (OR = 2.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study supports the following conclusions: 1) the risk profile of nonembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> is concise and intelligible, 2) the possible role of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the genesis of LI was not confirmed, and 3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025945" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic microangiopathy</z:e> may be implicated in the genesis of most of LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusions from this retrospective study should be taken as an interpretation of the results since some restriction in the sensitivity of the data analysis was deliberately introduced </plain></SENT>
