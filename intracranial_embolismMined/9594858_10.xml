<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aortic valve replacement or repair becomes a high-risk procedure in patients in whom the ascending aorta cannot be clamped either because of extensive calcification and risk of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> or because of extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> precluding safe dissection and clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report the results of aortic valve replacement or repair with deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Techniques to improve results include routine use of epiaortic and transesophageal echocardiography, avoidance of manipulation of the ascending aorta until the circulation is arrested, avoidance of antegrade cardioplegia, routine use of retrograde cardioplegia and retrograde cerebral perfusion, when feasible, and minimal aortotomy (just enough to excise and replace or repair the valve) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operations were accomplished in approximately 1 hour each with minimal manipulation of the aorta, thus minimizing aortic trauma and subsequent risk of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient had an unremarkable recovery without neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve replacement or repair using the "no-touch" technique and deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> is the preferred method when dealing with the porcelain or unclampable aorta </plain></SENT>
