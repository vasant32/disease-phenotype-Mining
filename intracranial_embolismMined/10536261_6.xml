<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using laser-scanning confocal microscopy and three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probes</z:chebi>, we measured in three-dimensions cerebral microvascular plasma perfusion, astrocytic reactivity, and neuronal injury assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>, GFAP immunoreactivity, and microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP2) immunoreactivity, respectively, in rats subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional quantitative analysis revealed that 2 h of embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulted in a significant (P&lt;0.05) reduction of cerebral microvascular plasma perfusion in the ipsilateral cortex and subcortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue within the ipsilateral cortex and subcortex with low plasma perfusion exhibited a significant (P&lt;0.05) increase in GFAP immunoreactivity compared with the homologous contralateral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional re-constructed images showed that prominent GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes surrounded large vessels with decreased plasma perfusion in downstream capillaries in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory when compared to the vessels in the contralateral homologous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Triple fluorescence probe-stained sections showed that tissue with decreased plasma perfusion and with increased GFAP immunoreactivity was accompanied by a reduction of MAP2 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that an impairment of microvascular perfusion induces an early increase in GFAP immunoreactivity, and reactive astrocytes may contribute to a further reduction of cerebral microvascular plasma perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The three-dimensional quantitative imaging analysis used in the present study provides a means to investigate parenchymal cellular responses to changes of cerebral microvascular plasma perfusion after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
