<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Systemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is recognized as a potentially fatal but extremely rare complication following percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its incidence might be underestimated by missing systemic air in patients without cardiac or cerebral symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was based on four cases (one man and three women; age range, 54 to 75 years) of systemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> complicating CT scan-guided transthoracic needle biopsy, which were encountered among 1,010 procedures performed at our institution from April 1999 to December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The target lesion was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> in three patients, and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025063" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mediastinal tumor</z:e> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure was performed percutaneously under CT scan-fluoroscopic guidance by using a coaxial biopsy needle system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients, a specimen was successfully obtained from the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During or immediately after the procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients experienced paroxysms of coughing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three patients without cardiac or cerebral symptoms, the presence of systemic air was confirmed on postprocedural CT scan images; it was resolved without causing morbidity after the immediate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of systemic air was missed in one initially asymptomatic patient, resulting in a subsequent neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> following CT scan-guided transthoracic needle biopsy was encountered more frequently than would be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The considerable attention we gave to this complication enabled us to recognize it in patients without cardiac or cerebral symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No sequelae were observed in the three patients in whom systemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> was detected, and the therapy was initiated immediately, whereas missing systemic air led to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in one patient in our four cases </plain></SENT>
