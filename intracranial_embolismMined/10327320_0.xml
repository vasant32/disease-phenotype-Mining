<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the short- and long-term results of surgical treatment of CIMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1989 to 1997, mitral valve replacement or repair was performed on 46 patients with CIMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average age range was 63.7 +/- 6.9; 8 patients were females; 30 patients (65.2%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV; 4 patients (8.6%) were in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was lower in 23 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative echo-Doppler analysis showed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> in 15 patients (32.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) was 33.6 +/- 13.6 mmHg, mean ejection fraction (EF) 37.8 +/- 13.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve replacement was performed in 12 patients (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve repair was performed in 34 patients (73.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myocardial revascularization was performed in 42 patients (91.3%) (mean graft/patient 2.2 +/- 0.8); aneurysmectomy was performed in 5 patients (10.8%), and in 2 patients (4.3%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid insufficiency</z:hpo> was corrected by performing annuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall operative mortality was 8.6% (4 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality for repair was 5.8% (2 patients) and for replacement was 16.6% (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient was reoperated three days after first operation due to annuloplasty dehiscence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperative morbidity included low output syndrome in 7 patients (15.2%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in 2 patients (4.3%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in 2 patients (4.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean length of stay in intensive care was 6.5 +/- 10.5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow-up (mean 27.6 +/- 3.3 months) was 88% complete and revealed good functional and clinical results: 86.4% of the patients in I-II NYHA class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One patient was reoperated due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred, one due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and the other to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While long-term follow-up is mandatory, our results suggest that: a) surgical treatment of CIMI is feasible with acceptable operative risks; b) mid-term functional and clinical results are favorable; c) the choice of treatment--valve replacement or repair--is still debatable </plain></SENT>
