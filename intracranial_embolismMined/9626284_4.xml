<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many reports in the medical literature have proposed methods of differentiating between gaseous and particulate emboli detected with the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the previously published methods with our own sample volume length (SVL) parameter to assess the accuracy of each method in classifying emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A pure source of gaseous and particulate emboli was obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies, respectively, and recorded onto digital audiotape for off-line analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 100 gaseous emboli and 215 particulate emboli were analyzed to measure four embolic parameters, namely, embolic duration, embolic velocity, relative signal intensity increase (measured embolic power [<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi>]), and SVL of the embolic signal (= Duration x Velocity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to assess the optimum threshold for each parameter to differentiate between particulate and gaseous emboli, and levels of sensitivity and specificity were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Embolic duration and velocity produced the poorest levels of sensitivity and specificity compared with the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> and SVL parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The optimum thresholds for embolic duration and velocity were 35 ms and 1 m/s, respectively, which produced a sensitivity (specificity) of 85.1% (87%) and 87% (67%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimum <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> and SVL thresholds were 30 dB and 12.8 mm, respectively, which produced a sensitivity (specificity) of 86.5% (95%) and 93% (97%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SVL and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> parameters were compared statistically (chi 2) at chosen specificity values of 90%, 95%, 97%, 99%, and 100%, which showed that the SVL sensitivities were statistically greater than <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> sensitivities (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SVL is the best parameter for differentiating between gaseous and particulate emboli but needs to be calculated with the use of a high-temporal-resolution spectral analyzer to measure embolic duration and velocity </plain></SENT>
