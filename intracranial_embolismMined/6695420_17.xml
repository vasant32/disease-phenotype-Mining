<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As part of the Ni-Hon-San Study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence was compared in the Japan and Hawaii cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> cases were classified in two types, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) and thrombo-embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (T-E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each type the incidence in Japan was about three times as great as in Hawaii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratio <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>/T-E was 1/2.2 and 1/1.6 in Japan and Hawaii, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was the most important risk factor, followed by age for total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in both Japan and Hawaii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>Proteinuria</z:hpo> was also a risk factor in Hawaii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, an index of animal food intake was inversely related to total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, significantly in Hawaii, and at a suggestive level for total and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the levels of blood pressure do not differ between Japan and Hawaii, one possible explanation for the large difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence between the two cohorts may be the fact that animal protein and saturated fat intake, which is inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence, is much greater in Hawaii than in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This explanation would support epidemiologic and experimental studies in Japan which suggest that dietary animal protein and fat exert an inhibitory effect on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
