<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between SSEPs and neurological impairment in the setting of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits received either 0, 50, 100, or 150 microL/kg of air into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SSEPs were recorded at intervals for the subsequent 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the final recording the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> was discontinued, and the animals recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were neurologically evaluated at 3 and 24 hours after cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> on a scale of zero (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) to 97 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>) points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a clear relationship between the dose of air and 2-hour SSEP amplitude (P = .00003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SSEP amplitudes at 2 hours were inversely correlated with neurological impairment scores at 3 hours (r = -0.71, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SSEP amplitudes at 2 hours were less in animals that died (11 +/- 16%; n = 9) than in those that survived to 24 hours (53 +/- 20%; n = 9) (P = .0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support SSEPs as an index of neurological impairment in this model of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
