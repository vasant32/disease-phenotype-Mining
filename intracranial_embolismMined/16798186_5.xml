<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Processing of pericardial shed blood with a cell-saving device was claimed to prevent <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> microembolization and to protect from neurocognitive dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study tested the hypothesis that processing of pericardial shed blood with a cell-saving device during cardiopulmonary bypass would significantly decrease serum levels of protein S100B, and improve brain oxygen saturation and neurologic outcome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers of brain injury in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients, 65 years of age and older, undergoing coronary artery bypass graft with cardiopulmonary bypass, were prospectively randomly assigned to processing of pericardial shed blood with a cell-saving device or to conventional use of a standard closed venous reservoir where cardiotomy blood was collected and reinfused through the arterial circuit (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum in S100B was measured 30 minutes, 4 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring was performed during the procedure and the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale was measured before surgery and at the time of discharge of the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the cell-saving device group averaged 72 +/- 3 years of age and underwent 3.1 +/- 0.7 coronary artery grafts with a mean of 62 +/- 20 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the control group averaged 75 +/- 4 years of age (p = 0.03) and underwent 3.3 +/- 0.6 coronary artery grafts (p = 0.49) with a mean of 75 +/- 25 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass time (p = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The quantity of blood administered from the cell-saving device averaged 281 +/- 162 mL per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum protein S100B levels averaged 0.06 +/- 0.03 before surgery and 0.51 +/- 0.23 microg/L 30 minutes after surgery in the cell-saving device patients compared with 0.076 +/- 0.04 before surgery (p = 0.32) and 1.48 +/- 0.66 (p &lt; 0.0001) in the control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The near-infrared spectroscopy baseline mean value of left and right cortical region was 58% +/- 12% and 55% +/- 7% in the cell-saving device group versus 59% +/- 7% and 53% +/- 6% in the control group (p = 0.67 and 0.36), and no difference occurred over time in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> score before and after surgery was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was one cerebrovascular complication in the control group (1 of 20, 5%) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The difference between the two groups occurred 30 minutes after surgery, at which time serum levels of protein S100B were significantly higher in the control group compared with cell-saving device patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although use of the cell-saving device was not associated with higher brain oxygen saturation nor changes in the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> score, it is associated with lesser release of nonspecific markers of brain injury in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
