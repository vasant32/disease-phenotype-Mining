<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative evaluation included clinical grading (Hunt and Hess) (20 patients were GR I, 43 GR II, 19 GR III, 9 GR IV and 9 GR V) angiography and CTScan grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The timing of surgery was determined according to angiographic, clinical and CTScan data: 73.2% of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were operated on between Day 0 and Day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control angiography and control CT were performed 10-12 days after surgery (earlier in case of clinical deterioration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post operative CTScan hypodensities were evaluated according to preoperative CT, preoperative angiography and post operative angiography: 32 hypodensities (8 without any symptom) were related to initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, vasospasm or post surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In five cases the etiology was dobble </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic control data showed 18 cases of vasospasm and 12 cases of post surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not find any complication due to the control angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The outcome was classified according to the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS): of 82 GR I.II.III (H &amp; H) cases, the outcome was 73 GOS 1-2 cases, 3 GOS 3 Cases, 1 GOS 4 case and 5 GOS 5 cases. of 18 GR IV.V (H &amp; H) cases, the outcome was 4 GOS 1-2 cases, 1 GOS 3 case, 1 GOS 4 case and 12 GOS 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 28 GOS 2-3-4-5 cases, the cause of disability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was under the main responsibility of the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> 13 times, of a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> 11 times, of the vasospasm 4 times with associated non neurological problems in seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the control angiography is not performed and when the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is unrecognized sequellae or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> can be erroneously attributed in many cases to the sole vasospasm or to the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
