<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Current rabbit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models often depend on symptoms as endpoints for embolization and produce wide variation in location, size, and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a further refinement of an angiographic embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, localized infarctions were correlated to neurologic deficits with the goal to create a rabbit model for long-term studies of therapies after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits (4-5 kg; N = 71) had selective internal carotid artery (ICA) angiography and a single clot was injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, neurologic assessment score (NAS) was measured on an 11-point scale (0, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; 10, dead) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains were removed and stained to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals with single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (n = 31) were analyzed by specific brain structure involvement, and NAS values were correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence differed by location, with cortex, subcortical, and basal ganglia regions highest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), at 52%, and anterior cerebral artery (ACA), at 29%, were most commonly involved, with the largest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volumes in the ACA distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brainstem and cerebellum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had disproportionately severe neurologic deficits, scoring 2.25 +/- 1.0 on the NAS, which represented a significant (P &lt; .02) difference versus cortex (0.5 +/- 0.2), subcortical (1.3 +/- 0.4), and basal ganglia (0.5 +/- 0.3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the frontal or parietal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA distributions included 81% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These sites were relatively silent (potentially allowing longer-term survival studies) whereas others in the posterior circulation produced disproportionately severe symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were not reliable indicators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence, and other endpoints such as imaging may be required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These are important steps toward refinement of the rabbit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
