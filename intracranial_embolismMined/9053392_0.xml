<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The causal treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> requires an exact analysis of the basic deficit of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> can be the result of hemodynamic insufficiency or frequently a consequence of thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distinction of both forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is possible only by dynamic measuring of regional cerebral blood flow and evaluation of the cerebral vascular reserve capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This allows to select of a small group of patients who suffer from carotid occlusion or a combined occlusion with stenosis of the contralateral side, where a characteristic disturbance of the cerebrovascular reserve capacity can be proved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By performing an extra-intracranial bypass, the cerebral collateral blood supply can be improved in order to reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study 26 patients received an extra-intracranial bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>7 weeks after surgery a normalization of the limited cerebrovascular reserve capacity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, thrombendarterectomy was conducted in 63 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the cerebrovascular reserve capacity had not been impaired in this group preoperatively, a further increase was observed following thrombendarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is indisputable that the indication for thrombendarterectomy is aiming towards elimination of the source of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, our results indicate that thrombendarterectomy has an additionally positive hemodynamic effect </plain></SENT>
