<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no clinically important haemodynamic changes during the operation, and oxygen saturation, capnography and acid base balance were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postop CT of the head showed a large left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with midline shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, the patient was found to have a previously unsuspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, and a venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in the left internal carotid artery, which probably had originated from the periprostatic venous plexus with a large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the distribution of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that massive paradoxical venous emboli can occur during surgery with minimal haemodynamic changes </plain></SENT>
