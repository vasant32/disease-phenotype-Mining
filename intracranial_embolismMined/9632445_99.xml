<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> can cause serious neurologic disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated risk factors for this disorder, including genetic risk factors (mutations in the genes encoding factor V and prothrombin) and nongenetic risk factors (such as the use of oral contraceptive agents) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the prevalence of these risk factors in 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral-vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, 80 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> of the lower extremities, and 120 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The G1691A mutation in the factor V gene and the G20210A prothrombin-gene mutation, which are established genetic risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the use of oral contraceptives and other risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of the prothrombin-gene mutation was higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (20 percent) than in healthy controls (3 percent; odds ratio, 10.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 31.0) and was similar to that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (18 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained for the mutation in the factor V gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of oral contraceptives was more frequent among women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (96 percent) than among controls (32 percent; odds ratio, 22.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 5.9 to 84.2) and among those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (61 percent; odds ratio, 4.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 17.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For women who were taking oral contraceptives and who also had the prothrombin-gene mutation (seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> but only one control), the odds ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> rose to 149.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 31.0 to 711.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the prothrombin gene and the factor V gene are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of oral contraceptives is also strongly and independently associated with the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of both the prothrombin-gene mutation and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="49325">oral-contraceptive</z:chebi> use raises the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> further </plain></SENT>
