<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has long been debated whether watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are caused by hemodynamic or embolic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated microembolic roles in the pathogenesis of watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> by examining MRI in a macaque monkey model of multiple microinfarcts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>50 Î¼m microbeads were injected into each internal carotid artery twice with a month interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monkeys (n=4) injected with 2250-2800 microbeads per unilateral side showed both cortical and internal watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and atrophic changes with microbleeds in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest embolic pathogenesis can contribute to the genesis of both cortical and internal watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in primates </plain></SENT>
