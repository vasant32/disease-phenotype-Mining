<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have shown that periprocedural rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are higher with carotid artery stenting (CAS) than with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the treatment of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) has shown higher rates of clinically silent new ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> when CAS is performed as compared with CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Silk Road Medical Embolic PROtectiOn System: First-In-Man (PROOF) Study is a single-arm first-in-man study using the MICHI Neuroprotection System (Silk Road Medical Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif), a novel transcervical access and cerebral embolic protection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This system enables stent implantation under controlled blood flow reversal of the carotid artery, also known as Flow Altered Short Transcervical Carotid Artery Stenting (FAST-CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2009 and February 2010, a total of 44 subjects were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary composite endpoint was major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients (97.7%) completed the study through the 30-day endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of consecutive subjects, DW-MRI examinations were performed preprocedure and within 24 to 48 hours after the stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blinded independent neuroradiologists reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DW-MRI studies and confirmed the absence or presence of new ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> enrolled patients were successfully treated, and no major adverse events were seen through the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one subjects had DW-MRI examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of these, five patients (16%) had evidence of new ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> but no clinical sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Transient intolerance to reverse flow was reported in 9% of cases, but in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, a stent was successfully placed, and the intolerance was managed by minimizing the duration of reverse flow during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this first-in-man experience, FAST-CAS using the MICHI Neuroprotection System was shown to be a safe and feasible method for carotid revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI findings suggest controlled reverse flow provides cerebral embolic protection similar to that seen with CEA </plain></SENT>
