<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous cardiopulmonary assist devices (PCPS) have become available in interventional cardiology within recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These tools offer the opportunity of performing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in high-risk patients characterized by significant stenoses of several coronary arteries and a poor left ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unclear for which patients PCPS are necessary and which patients will profit by PTCA as compared to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the anticipated risk of CABG and of PTCA without assist devices was calculated according to risk scores and compared with our results of assisted PTCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition the long-term survival rate was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 35 patients (mean 65.5 years of age, 12 females, 23 males), we performed PTCA concomitant with the use of cardiac assist devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The indications for the use of a cardiac assist device were severely impaired LV function (EF 30% +/- 8.9%) in combination with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (2.7 +/- 0.3 vessels) and a significant supply area of the vessel to be dilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients, PCPS was started before coronary angioplasty because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 21 cases, PCPS was on a standby basis without being connected to the patient's circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients, a left heart assist device, the 14F-Hemopump, was inserted percutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients were analyzed using risk scores of angioplasty and of coronary bypass graft surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The calculated risk of hemodynamic compromise during PTCA according to the risk scores was more than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The anticipated risk of a fatal outcome following CABG would have been 19.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PTCA was performed on an average of 2.0 coronary arteries per patient and was successful in 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We observed a decline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> classification (CCS) from 3.5 to 1.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>An average reduction of 1.1 NYHA class was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The in-hospital mortality was 8.6% (3 patients: 1 x <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, 1 x early reocclusion, 1 x <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>At 24 months follow-up, a re-PTCA was necessary in four cases because of restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the remainder, NYHA and CCS class were stable during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>An additional five patients died during the first year and two patients in the second year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PTCA with the use of a cardiac assist device shows favorable short-term results in a subset of patients with extended <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and severely impaired LV function who are not suitable for nonsupported PTCA or CABG due to their risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, the long term results are not satisfying and stress the need for complete revascularisation with CABG once the patient's condition is stabilized by means of supported PTCA </plain></SENT>
