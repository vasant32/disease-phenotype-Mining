<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiographically, four of the five cases revealed distention and elongation of the vertebrobasilar artery like dolichoectasia and one irregular stenosis, the so-called "string sign" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dolichoectatic dissecting lesions by demonstrating intimal flaps, double lumen, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> clot in the false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also present a successful demonstration of slow flow in the false lumen by gradient refocused magnetic resonance imaging scan with partial flip angle by the cardiac gating method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that many of the classical "dolichoectasia" may include dissecting lesions </plain></SENT>
