<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with nonrheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) have been unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied whether or not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was associated with a decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with nonrheumatic AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed an observational analysis of retrospectively collected data on 290 patients with nonrheumatic AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left atrial diameter (LAD) and the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> were estimated by transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 7.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among these patients, 68 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the follow-up (rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> per year of follow-up 3.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 95 patients with LAD of &gt; or =48 mm, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (9%) in the severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> group (moderate or severe, n=43) was significantly lower than that (25%) of the mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> group (none, trivial, or mild; n=52) (chi-square=3.95, p=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> from mild to severe groups, for every 10 mm increment in LA size, for sex, and for every increase of 10 years of age was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.97), 1.06 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.49), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.55 to 1.72), and 1.33 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.71), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with nonrheumatic AF, age was an independent predictor of an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> may be protective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially in those patients with LA enlargement </plain></SENT>
