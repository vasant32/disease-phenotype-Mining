<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 73 of 83 consecutive patients with a CT-verified small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the course of the initial deficit was retrospectively assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four percent showed their maximal deficit at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, while 36% had progression of the initial deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between these 2 groups, there was no difference in the number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and in the number of patients with a probable cardiac embolic cause of the lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with progressive lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had larger volume <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and showed less favourable outcome at one month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that progression of symptoms in patients suffering a small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is due to an increase of the infarcted area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This offers a rationale for early <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment in patients with small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, since any beneficial effect of such treatment has not been established so far, a prospective controlled study is warranted </plain></SENT>
