<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To test whether the prognosis of systemic thrombolysis can be estimated with the attenuation values of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> as measured with multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prior to thrombolysis with rt-PA, the attenuation values of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> were determined with a helical MSCT using a collimation of 0.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 5 patients that were 63 - 79 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the help of reference values that were obtained from a phantom study we categorised the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> according to their attenuation values as being mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> with low or high proportions of erythrocytes, or red <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TOF angiographies were done before and after the thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The systemic therapy with rt-PA was effective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> that had attenuation values of red <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> or of mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> with a high proportion of erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The therapy showed no effect when the attenuation values matched with mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> with a low proportion of erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Due to artefacts that were caused by beam hardening, attenuation measurements could not be performed in the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presented cases are in accordance with the results of experimental studies which indicate that the efficacy of thrombolysis increases with the attenuation values of thromboembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of attenuation measurements by MSCT for the prognosis of systemic thrombolysis cannot be given yet </plain></SENT>
