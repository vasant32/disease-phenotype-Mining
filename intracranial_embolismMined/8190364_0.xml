<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there were no visible 5-hydroxytryptamine-like immunoreactive nerve fibers in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals, we found many of these fibers near the clot emboli 30 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and the number of fibers increased slightly with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In immunohistochemical double staining, these fibers corresponded to neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactive nerve fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And they were not observed in animals after superior cervical ganglionectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the sympathetic nerves take up <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> released from intraluminal aggregating platelets </plain></SENT>
