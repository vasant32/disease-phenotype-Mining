<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to clarify whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> are causative factors in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, who were normotensive, nondiabetic, and not <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, were classified into three groups--atherothrombotic infarction (n = 16), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (n = 10), and cardioembolic infarction (n = 8)--based on clinical findings, brain imaging, and cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was determined by the steady state plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> method with the use of octreotide <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were compared with those of healthy control subjects (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Steady state plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in the atherothrombotic infarction group compared with control subjects and the other two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups, indicating the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in patients with atherothrombotic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the atherothrombotic infarction group, the 2-hour insulin area (area under the plasma insulin concentration curve) during a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was significantly increased and dyslipidemic changes (increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B, decreased <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>) were observed, whereas these changes were not found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> in association with compensatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> may be an important pathogenetic factor underlying the development of atherothrombotic infarction </plain></SENT>
