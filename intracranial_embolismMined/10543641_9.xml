<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Advances in thrombolytic therapy, brain imaging, and neurointerventional techniques provide new therapeutic options for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial thrombolysis has proved to be a potent therapeutic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To show that this procedure can be performed in community hospitals, we describe our experience with a group of 11 patients treated for middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients seen during a period of 1 year with clinical findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> major-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> met screening criteria and were evaluated under an institutional review board-approved protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After CT scanning, 17 of those patients met strict criteria, gave informed consent, and underwent angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had M1 and M2 middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> and received local thrombolytic therapy with urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization efficacy, complications, and outcome data were compiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average score on the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale was 22.2 at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of treatment and 12.5 after therapy, with 91% of patients showing neurologic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete (TIMI 3) recanalization occurred in 73% of cases and partial recanalization (TIMI 2) in 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the 90-day follow-up evaluation, 56% of patients had good outcomes (modified Rankin score, 0 to 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial thrombolysis can be performed in a community hospital by radiologists with interventional and neuroradiologic skills given appropriate institutional preparation </plain></SENT>
