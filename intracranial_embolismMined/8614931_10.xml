<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the time course of cerebral microembolism in patients with symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and to assess its relation to specific symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: On the basis of criteria established a priori, 69 middle cerebral arteries were selected from a series of consecutive studies obtained at our neurovascular laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had radiological evidence of cervical internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> and had corresponding symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A TC-2000 instrument equipped with special software for microembolus detection was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accepted signals were unidirectional from baseline, had a chirping sound, were 9 dB higher than the surrounding blood, and lasted 25 milliseconds or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HITS were identified in 20 of 69 (29%) arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and time of testing was 4 days for HITS-positive arteries and 12 days for those that were HITS negative (P=.0046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 32 (44%) arteries with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and 6 of 37 (16%) arteries with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were HITS positive (P=.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, HITS are detected more frequently when patients are tested soon after symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HITS are also more prevalent in the territories of arteries with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings may have diagnostic and therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
