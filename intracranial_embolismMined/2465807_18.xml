<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the patients present with comparable patterns of error types, they differ in the distribution of errors as a function of letter position in words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients' patterns of errors are compared to previously reported patterns of spelling errors in dysgraphic patients and are discussed in terms of hypothesized mechanisms that operate on the representations that are stored in the Graphemic Buffer </plain></SENT>
