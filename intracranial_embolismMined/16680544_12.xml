<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is a common risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While intermittent AF also appears to pose a substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, the quantitative relationship between the percentage of time spent in AF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk is poorly specified and "intermittent" AF is not the same as paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improved assessment of the impact of AF burden on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk will allow more targeted and safer use of antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The primary objective of this study is to determine if AT/AF (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> device detected atrial tachyarrhythmias, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>) burden over a 30 day period is an independent predictor of the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> in subjects not receiving anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TRENDS is a prospective, post-market, non-randomized, multicenter study designed to enroll 3100 subjects who have an independent Class I/II indication for cardiac rhythm device implantation and who have demographic features suggestive of an increased risk for thromboembolic complications related to AT/AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> implanted devices will have the ability to collect long-term AT/AF burden trending data and will be equivalently programmed to ensure consistent data collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects will be followed with device interrogations every 3 months and clinic visits every 6 months for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with a documented history of AT/AF prior to enrollment and those who develop AT/AF during the 12-month follow-up will be followed until the last subject enrolled in the study has completed their 24-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the TRENDS study should help clarify the implications of data retrieved from an implantable device with regard to the risk for thromboembolic complications from atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, even in the absence of symptoms </plain></SENT>
