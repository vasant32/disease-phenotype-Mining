<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This results in white cell activation and a whole body <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary neutrophil sequestration is also known to occur during cardiopulmonary bypass and has been associated with pulmonary damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has been previously demonstrated using the technique of differential neutrophil counts in simultaneous venous and left atrial samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography as an indicator of cerebral microembolism has also been proved in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to determine whether <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> precoating with Duraflo II reduced pulmonary neutrophil sequestration, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microembolism and postoperative blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were randomized into two groups using either <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-coated or nonheparin-coated cardiopulmonary bypass circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results suggest a reduction in pulmonary neutrophil sequestration (p greater than 0.05) and the generation of thrombin antithrombin complexes (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> microembolism was not significantly different in the two groups nor was the postoperative blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-coated cardiopulmonary bypass circuits do not reduce pulmonary neutrophil sequestration, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microembolism or postoperative blood loss </plain></SENT>
