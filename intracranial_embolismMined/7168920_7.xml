<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> are frequently found in the leptomeningeal arteries over watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These occlusions have largely been interpreted as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> secondary to slowing of the blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report suggests that most of the occlusions are microemboli, which may lodge preferentially in these areas, and that they are the cause of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> rather than secondary events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These suggestions are based upon the analysis of three groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first group consists of four cases, two of which had atheromatous masses and the other two, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> emboli in the overlying leptomeningeal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases prove beyond doubt that microemboli can lodge preferentially in the watershed areas and cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second group consists of the cases of watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that were precipitated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0520541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypotensive episodes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one of these showed occlusion of the overlying arteries, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them obviously had slowing of the blood flow during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cases thus discredit the concept that stagnation <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a frequent event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, three cases with watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> interpreted as platelet microemboli are presented to demonstrate different pathogenetic mechanisms effective in the process of embolization </plain></SENT>
