<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women 15-44 years old who suffered a cerebral thromboembolic attack (CTA) during the period 1994-95 and 1200 age matched control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 309 patients and 1200 control subjects questionnaires sent out, 271 patients (87.7%) and 1074 control subjects (89.5%) responded and agreed to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of women with nonvalid diagnoses, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic diseases</z:hpo>, or current pregnancy, 219 patients and 1041 control subjects were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After confounder control and with nonusers as reference, current users of first generation OC (50 micrograms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinyl estradiol</z:chebi> [EE] or estrans) had an odds ratio (OR) of CTA of 1.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-3.92); users of second generation OC (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50815">norgestimate</z:chebi>) had an OR of 2.37 (1.35-4.16); and users of third generation OC (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4453">desogestrel</z:chebi> or gestodene) had an OR of 1.32 (0.78-2.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Users of OC with 50, 30-40, or 20 micrograms EE had OR of 2.65 (1.11-6.34), 1.60 (1.05-2.43), and 1.59 (0.57-4.58), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> types were as follows: estrans 1.37 (0.60-3.13), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi> 2.43 (1.40-4.21), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50815">norgestimate</z:chebi> 7.09 (1.87-26.8), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4453">desogestrel</z:chebi> 1.62 (0.72-3.63), and gestodene 1.24 (0.67-2.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duration of use was without significant influence on the risk and the OR were constant across the age bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with women who had never used OC, former users had an OR of CTA of 0.95 (0.66-1.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, use of OC with 50 micrograms of EE and OC with second generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi> increased the risk of CTA significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OC with third generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi> did not have any significant influence on the risk of CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of CTA among former users of OC was not increased </plain></SENT>
