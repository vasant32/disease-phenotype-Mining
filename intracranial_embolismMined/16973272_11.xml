<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we demonstrated that treatment with human recombinant HGF (hrHGF) attenuated the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) observed after microsphere embolism-induced sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To see if tight junctional proteins were involved in this attenuation, in the present study, we investigated the effects of HGF on the levels of occludin and zonula occludens (ZO)-1 in cerebrovascular endothelial cells after microsphere embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by the injection of 700 microspheres (48 microm diameter) into the right internal carotid artery of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>hrHGF was injected into the right ventricle of the brain by using an osmotic pump at a dose of 30 microg/7 days per animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of tight junctional proteins in the endothelial cells were examined by immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with hrHGF attenuated the decrease in the expression of occludin and ZO-1 proteins in the endothelial cells that occurred after sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, treatment with hrHGF resulted in retention of these tight junctional proteins in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>)-albumin-perfused cerebral vessels, which did not leak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-albumin in the ipsilateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HGF-mediated maintenance of the tight junctional proteins in the endothelial cells may be a possible mechanism for the protective effect of HGF against the disruption of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
