<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the underlying pathophysiology requires animal models that allow embolisation of air bubbles of defined diameter and number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein we present a method for the production of gas bubbles of defined diameter and their injection into the carotid artery of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of gas microemboli injected is quantified digitally using a high speed optical image capturing system and a custom-made software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a first pilot study, 0, 50, 100, 400 and 800 gas bubbles of 160 microm in diameter were injected into the carotid artery of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Offline evaluation revealed a high constancy of the bubble diameters (mean 159.95+/-9.25 microm, range 144-188 microm) and the number of bubbles injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First preliminary data indicate that with increasing number of bubbles embolised, more animals revealed neurological deficits and (particularly with higher bubble counts) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> on TTC-staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, also animals without overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on TTC-staining displayed neurological deficits in an apparently dose dependent fashion, indicating subtle brain damage by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the method presented allows injecting air bubbles of defined number and diameter into cerebral arteries of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This technique facilitates animal research in the field of air embolisation </plain></SENT>
