<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although cannulation of the femoral artery is used routinely for thoracic aortic operations with hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, retrograde perfusion through the descending aorta carries the risk of cerebral malperfusion or embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have, therefore, routinely used a central cannulation technique for distal arch and descending aortic operations since 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared neurological outcome in consecutive patients undergoing femoral versus ascending aortic perfusion for these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1987 and 1998, 61 patients underwent aortic resection with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, but without retrograde cerebral perfusion, for lesions of the aortic arch and descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients had fusiform true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 19 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and 11 had extensive saccular or false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients (52%) were perfused via the femoral artery (group A), and 29 patients (48%) from the ascending aorta (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality and morbidity, and neurological outcome, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in mean age, pathology, abdominal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, net perfusion time, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were four hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (three in group A and one in group B; P = 0.61), including one neurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in group A, group A suffered a higher incidence of neurological events (nine patients: 28%) than group B (two patients: 7%; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Temporary focal neurological deficits occurred in both groups (two patients in group A, 6% and two patients in group B, 7%; P &gt; 0.99), but permanent injury occurred exclusively in group A (seven patients: four with monoplegia, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, and two with diffuse cerebral injury with one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anterograde perfusion using a proximal aortic cannula provides a low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and allows extensive aortic resection with low morbidity </plain></SENT>
