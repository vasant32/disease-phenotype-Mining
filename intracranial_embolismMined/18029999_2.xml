<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a first step towards a physiologically realistic virtual patient, we have created a computer model investigating the effects of emboli (particles or gas bubbles) as they become lodged in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our model provides a framework for predicting the severity of microvascular obstruction by simulating fundamental interactions between emboli and the fractal geometry of the arterial tree through which they travel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model vasculature consisted of a bifurcating fractal tree comprising over a million branches ranging between 1 mm and 12 microm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motion of emboli through the tree was investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the effects of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> size, clearance time and embolization rate on the number and persistence of blocked arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our simulations reveal with striking clarity that the relationship between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> properties and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular obstruction</z:e> is nonlinear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observe a rapid change between free-flowing and severely blocked arteries at specific combinations of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> size and embolization rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model predicts distinct patterns of cerebral injury for solid and gaseous emboli which are consistent with clinical observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Solid emboli are predicted to be responsible for focal persistent injuries, while fast-clearing gas emboli produce diffuse transient blockages similar to global hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The impact of solid emboli was found to be dramatically reduced by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Computer simulations of embolization provide a novel means of investigating the role of emboli in producing neurological injury and assessing effective strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
