<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compound action potentials (CAPs) were recorded by electrocochleography and cochlear blood flow (CBF) was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Photothrombotic occlusion of the AICA caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850058" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inner ear ischemia</z:e> to various degrees with or without alterations of the CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With use of this model we investigated the critical range of the CBF for preserving cochlear function, represented by the CAPs induced with 8 kHz half-wave of sinusoid at 100 dB SPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results then showed that a CBF range between 26.7% and 42.9% of baseline was somewhat critical for maintenance of cochlear function in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> significantly delayed thrombotic occlusion of the AICA in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further use of our model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850058" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inner ear ischemia</z:e> may be useful for studying pathophysiology and pharmacological therapy of cochlear disturbances subsequent to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_105'>circulatory disorders</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
