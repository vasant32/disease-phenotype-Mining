<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cervical spinal manipulation leading to cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in the absence of dissection is not described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current case documents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> originating from extensively calcified internal carotid artery immediately following cervical spinal manipulation in the absence of dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe a case and imaging findings of a 63-year-old male who underwent cervical spinal manipulation and developed sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of left-arm numbness and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Computed tomography angiography demonstrated extensively calcified right internal carotid artery at the site of redone carotid endarterectomy as well as calcified <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in the right inferior middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Calcified carotid artery may be at risk for embolization following cervical spinal manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our recommendation is that, patients with extensively calcified carotid arteries should refrain from aggressive neck maneuvers and cervical spine manipulation therapy to avoid liberation of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
