<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk assessment of balloon test occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) with enlarged haemodynamic monitoring prior to permanent ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 24 patients with cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (n = 18), cavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> (n = 3) or inoperable cavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 3) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The test occlusion was monitored by EEG, neurological examinations and transcranial Doppler sonography of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery with evaluation of the cerebrovascular reserve capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT imaging was added showing the perfusion during test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In one (4%) patient the test occlusion had to be interrupted previously due to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This patient and two (8%) patients with highly pathological test results in SPECT and TCD were excluded from permanent carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 6 (25%) patients quantitative TCD monitoring could improve the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk assessment by differentiating the patients in a low and high risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>6 (25%) patients were definitely occluded without haemodynamic complications, but two patients suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarctions</z:e> which cannot be predicted by this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The multimodal balloon test occlusion with enlarged haemodynamic monitoring allows haemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk assessment prior to permanent occlusion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
