<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the authors investigated the effect of clomethiazole on cerebral outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred forty-five patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery were recruited at two centers and prospectively randomized to clomethiazole edisilate (0.8%), 225 ml (1.8 mg) loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 100 ml/h (0.8 mg/h) during surgery, or 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> (placebo) in a double-blind trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronary artery grafting was completed during moderate hypothermic (28-32 degrees C) cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma clomethiazole was measured at several intervals during and up to 24 h after the end of infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A battery of eight neuropsychological tests was administered preoperatively and repeated 4-7 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the change in neuropsychological test scores from baseline was used to determine the effect of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neuropsychological assessments were completed in 219 patients (110 clomethiazole; 109 placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma concentration of clomethiazole during surgery was 66.2 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the clomethiazole and placebo group in the postoperative change in neuropsychological test scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clomethiazole did not improve cerebral outcome following coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
