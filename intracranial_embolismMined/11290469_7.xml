<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is generally acknowledged to be more sensitive in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than is conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose in the present study was to evaluate the utility of fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging compared with that of diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging for the diagnosis of hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed patient records and cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in a 13-month period from whom diffusion-weighted and fast-FLAIR imaging were obtained within 6 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Special attention was paid to the presence or absence of arterial hyperintensity on FLAIR images and abnormally high-signal regions on diffusion-weighted images in the affected vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arterial hyperintensity was found in eight of 11 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had embolic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic infarctions</z:e> with middle cerebral arterial (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial hyperintensity was negative in the remaining three patients; the vascular territories were the posterior circulation region in two of these patients and the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> region in one, and the types of infarction in these same patients were lacunar in two and embolic in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regions with high-signal diffusion abnormalities relevant to the patients' symptoms were found in 10 of 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient showed no diffusion abnormalities but the presence of arterial hyperintensity in the affected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory on the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examination, and manifested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> along with arterial hyperintensity on the initial FLAIR image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is highly sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging alone may not rule out a possible infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arterial hyperintensity on FLAIR images can precede diffusion abnormalities and may provide a clue to the early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002965" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impending infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
