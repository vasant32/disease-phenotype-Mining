<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 10 outpatients with CarboMedics (Sulzer Carbomedics Inc., n = 5) and ATS prosthetic heart valves (n = 5) in the aortic (n = 8), mitral (n = 1), or both aortic and mitral positions (n = 1) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monitoring was performed simultaneously over the middle and anterior cerebral arteries and the common carotid artery for 30 minutes with the 2 MHZ transducers of a color duplex scanner (common carotid artery) and pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography (intracranial arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were harvested in an eight-channel digital audio tape recorder, and microembolic signal counts were evaluated online by two separate observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher microembolic signal counts were recorded in the common carotid artery (112 [75 to 175]) compared with the middle and anterior cerebral arteries (30 [18 to 36], p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interobserver variability was satisfactory (k = 0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly argue for gaseous underlying embolic material in patients with artificial heart valves because bubbles are bound to implode with time </plain></SENT>
