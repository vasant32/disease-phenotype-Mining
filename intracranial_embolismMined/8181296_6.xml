<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We conducted the current study to evaluate the removal rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> from cerebral arteries after spontaneous breathing at a low FIO2 in comparison with mechanical ventilation at an FIO2 of 1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomized, experimental trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Neuroimaging department at a veterinary school hospital laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Nine anesthetized beagles undergoing mechanical ventilation with previous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cranial computed tomography (CT) scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: In each dog, after a control scan, air was infused at a constant flow rate, via a catheter inserted into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT scan was repeated until typical bubbles appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediately after, the animals were randomly assigned to breathe room air (group A), or to be mechanically ventilated at an FIO2 of 1.0 (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT scan was again repeated every minute until the removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We compared the volume of air infused per kg of body and brain weights, the lowest density among bubbles (Hounsfield units), the duration of radiologic findings, and the ratio of volume/duration (mL/kg/min) between the two groups, using the Mann-Whitney test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The volume of air infused per kg of body and brain weights and density were not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The duration of radiologic findings was shorter (p &lt; .02) in group B (7.0 +/- 4.7) than in group A (20.4 +/- 3.8), and the air removal rate from cerebral arteries (expressed as volume/duration of radiologic findings) was dramatically improved (p &lt; .02) in group B (0.159 +/- 0.042) in comparison with group A (0.046 +/- 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the removal rate of air from cerebral arteries is dramatically increased by mechanical ventilation at an FIO2 of 1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may be decreased, but the result does not account for the effects of each factor separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to evaluate the clinical benefits of high FIO2 administration and of mechanical ventilation separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the prompt application of mechanical ventilation with an FIO2 of 1.0 may be recommended when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is suspected </plain></SENT>
