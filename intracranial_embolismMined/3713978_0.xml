<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently encountered a 38 years old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> considered to be caused by oral contraception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This patient took oral contraceptives for 17 days following therapeutic abortion, and was transferred to our hospital because of disturbed consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scans disclosed a right temporo-occipital subcortical hemorrhagic infarction and bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiograms showed non-filling of cortical veins in the same area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The internal cerebral vein, vein of Galen and right transverse sinus were not visualized either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and necrotic tissue were removed to avoid farther neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brain was swollen and hyperemic, and thrombosed cortical veins were clearly recognized at operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases, including ours, of cerebrovascular diseases associated with oral contraception were reported up to now in Japan, and only 3 of them were diagnosed objectively as venous or sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average age of these 12 cases was 34 years old and many of them experienced abortion or therapeutic abortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We believe that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of this pathological state is based on gynecological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e>, and the oral contraception may play a role of a trigger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Oral contraception should be contraindicated in patients with gynecological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and/or smoking habit </plain></SENT>
