<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Coronary artery bypass surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass carries a significant risk of perioperative brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At least 1% to 5% will suffer a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and at 3-months postoperatively approximately 30% are reported to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> assessed by neuropsychologic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In off-pump surgery cardiopulmonary bypass is not used and instrumentation on the ascending aorta is reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main aim of this study was to assess if off-pump surgery reduces intraoperative cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective and randomized study of two comparable groups with regard to age, sex, years of education, preoperative cognitive functioning, and surgical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two patients (29 off-pump) were monitored by the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound for cerebral microembolization during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and postoperative clinical, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, and neuropsychologic examinations were also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the number of cerebral microemboli during off-pump compared with on-pump surgery (16.3 [range 0 to 131] versus 90.0 [range 15 to 274], p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference with regard to the incidence of neuropsychologic performance (decline in 29% off-pump, 35% on-pump) or neuroradiologic findings at 3 months was found, and there was no association between the number of cerebral microemboli and cognitive outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly demonstrates that off-pump surgery leads to a reduction in intraoperative cerebral microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in the number of off-pump patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> or ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging could not be demonstrated in this relatively small patient population </plain></SENT>
