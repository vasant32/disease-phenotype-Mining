<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five years after the pacemaker implantation, he suffered from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 4.5 months after the ictus, he was transferred to the rehabilitation ward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had flaccid left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0184554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disuse syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By modulating the rate-responsive mode of the pacemaker every 2-4 weeks, we were able to rehabilitate the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the patient could sit in a wheelchair for more than three hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case emphasizes the importance of examining the mode and function of a previously implanted artificial pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In accord with varying rehabilitation programs and gradual improvement in a patient's physical activities, periodic modulation of a programmable pacemaker can lead to a better functional outcome during rehabilitation therapy </plain></SENT>
