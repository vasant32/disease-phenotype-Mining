<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous experimental and clinical studies yielded the following results: CSF flow around the subarachnoid vessels is often interrupted by subarachnoid clots; anaerobical incubation of CSF-blood mixture led to a marked fall in the pH value; the vasocontractility of anaerobically incubated CSF-blood mixtures was greater than that of aerobically incubated samples; vasocontraction induced by anaerobically incubated samples was inhibited to a far greater extent the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor meclofenamic acid than by phenoxybenzamine; cases of asymptomatic marked angiographical vasospasm or of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with relatively slight angiographical vasospasm were not rarely encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those results lead us to a hypothesis that, in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, subarachnoid focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> resulting from anaerobical changes of subarachnoid clots may be factor upsetting the balance of the synthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> from PG endoperoxides on the inner surface of cerebral arteries, in favor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>--which plays a role in arterial contraction and in thrombosing with platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On this basis we have been testing the administrations of trapidil, an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and selective synthesis inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>, in 20 consecutive suitable cases so far, for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> after aneurysmal rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographical vasospasm was seen in 9 of the 20 cases, but no signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were detected in 7 of the 9 cases, either clinically or in CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The importance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation by platelet aggregation in symptomatic vasospasm are thus suggested </plain></SENT>
