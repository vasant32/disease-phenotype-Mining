<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the use of the Parodi Anti-Emboli System (PAES) for cerebral protection during emergent vertebral artery recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old chimney sweep was referred with recurrent episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Left vertebral artery (LVA) flow was barely detectable on duplex Doppler, and brain computed tomography revealed a small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed subtotal ostial stenosis of the LVA with poor distal flow and possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to a high risk of distal embolization with percutaneous treatment, anticoagulation was initiated, and the lesion was to be re-evaluated in 2 to 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 2 days later, the patient developed severe, aggravating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, gait and left-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002070'>limb ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000666'>horizontal nystagmus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Emergent angiography showed a total ostial LVA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PAES was employed to elicit a temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal</z:e> during percutaneous LVA recanalization, thus protecting the brain from embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ostial LVA was successfully recanalized and stented, with immediate symptom cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PAES can be successfully applied in the subclavian artery to prevent distal embolization during emergent vertebral artery recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since a significant proportion of vertebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are embolic, PAES may play a novel role in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
