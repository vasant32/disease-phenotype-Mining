<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study was undertaken to analyse the risk factors for systemic emboli in infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 80; 70% males; mean age 65 years; range 20-91 years) with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, as defined by the Duke criteria and diagnosed using transoesophageal echocardiography during the period January 1995 to March 2001, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average time between the start of the illness and the beginning of antibiotic treatment was 55 days (range 0-405 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathogens identified were streptococci (n = 47), staphylococci (n = 11), enterococci (n = 9), and others (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nine cases, blood cultures were <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients with at least one embolic episode were compared with 50 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to univariate analysis, the main risk factor for systemic emboli was the size of the vegetation (12.4 mm vs. 7.8 mm; p = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of emboli was 57% when the vegetation measured &gt; 10 mm and only 22% when it was &lt; 10 mm (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mobility of the vegetation was also a risk factor: 48% if the vegetation was mobile; and 9% if fixed (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sex, age, pathogen, antibiotic treatment, type of valve and the number and position of the vegetations were not found to be risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With multivariate analysis, only mobility was identified as a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, mobile vegetations &gt; 10 mm in size were associated with an increased risk of embolic episodes in infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
