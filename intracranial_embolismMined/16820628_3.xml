<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The autograft procedure, an option in aortic valve replacement, has undergone technical evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A considerable debate about the most favorable surgical technique in the Ross operation is still ongoing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Originally described as a subcoronary implant, the full root replacement technique is now the most commonly used technique to perform the Ross principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between June of 1994 and June of 2005, the original subcoronary autograft technique was performed in 347 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative, perioperative, and follow-up data were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean patient age at implantation was 44+/-13 years (range 14 to 71 years; 273 male, 74 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bicuspid valve <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was present in 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The underlying valve disease was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> in 111 patients, stenosis in 46 patients, combined lesion in 188 patients, and active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in 22 patients (in 2 patients without stenosis or regurgitation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concomitant procedures were performed in 130 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up visits were obtained annually (mean follow up 3.9+/-2.7 years, 1324 patient-years; completeness of follow-up 99.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The in-hospital mortality rate was 0.6% (n =2), and the late mortality was 1.7% (n=6), with 5 noncardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (4 cancer, 1 multiorgan failure after noncardiac surgery) and 1 cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, 94% of the surviving patients were in New York Heart Association class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ross procedure-related valvular reoperations were necessary in 9 patients: Three received autograft explants, 5 received homograft explants, and 1 received a combined auto- and homograft explant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up visit, autograft/homograft regurgitation grade II was present in 5/10 patients and grade III in 4/0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Maximum/mean pressure gradients were 7.4+/-6.2/3.7+/-2.1 mm Hg across the autograft and 15.3+/-9.4/7.6+/-5.0 mm Hg across the right ventricular outflow tract, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>Aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Freedom from any valve-related intervention was 95% at 8 years (95% confidence interval 91% to 99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Midterm follow-up of autograft procedures according to the original Ross subcoronary approach proves excellent clinical and hemodynamic results, with no considerable reoperation rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Revival of the original subcoronary Ross operation should be taken into account when considering the best way to install the Ross principle </plain></SENT>
