<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prompt establishment of antegrade perfusion via ascending aorta may improve the surgical results of type A dissections, especially in the situations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we evaluated the efficacy of use of the dissected ascending aorta as an alternative arterial inflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2002 and 2006, 32 patients underwent prosthetic graft replacement of the ascending aorta or hemiarch for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ascending aorta was routinely cannulated, in addition to the femoral artery, with a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-coating flexible cannula for arterial inflow, using Seldinger technique, and by epiaortic ultrasonographic guidance (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antegrade systemic perfusion via ascending aorta was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ascending aorta cannulation was safely performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no malperfusion or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> due to ascending aorta cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary bypass was established within 30 min after skin incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was one in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to duodenal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (1/32=3.1%), two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (2/32=6.3%), and one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients (29/32=90.6%) were discharged in New York Heart Association class I and have been followed up uneventfully for a mean of 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Antegrade perfusion via the ascending aorta was successfully performed with low mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With ultrasound-guided Seldinger technique, ascending aorta cannulation has a potential to be a simple and safe option that enables rapid establishment of antegrade systemic perfusion in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
