<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The distal-balloon protection system is being evaluated for its efficacy in preventing embolic neurological events during carotid stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the effect of this system on the frequency of Doppler-detected microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using transcranial Doppler, we compared the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during CAS in 2 groups: 39 patients without distal protection and 37 who used the distal-balloon protection system (GuardWire) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the clinical or angiographic characteristics between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three phases with increased <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts were identified during unprotected CAS; these were stent deployment, predilation, and postdilation (75+/-57, 32+/-36, and 27+/-25 METS, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distal-balloon protection significantly reduced the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during CAS (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts: 164+/-108 in the control versus 68+/-83 in the protection group; P=0.002), particularly during these 3 phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the protection group were detected predominantly during sheath placement, guidewire manipulation, and distal-balloon deflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three phases with increased <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts were identified during unprotected CAS (eg, stent deployment, predilation, and postdilation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distal-balloon protection system significantly reduced the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during CAS, particularly during these 3 phases </plain></SENT>
