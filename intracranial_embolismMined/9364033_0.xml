<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively investigated 80 patients with 102 moderate/severe internal carotid artery lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with additional potential sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral transcranial Doppler monitorings of the middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) were performed for =&gt;30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HITS occurred more often in patients with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (21.9%) than in patients with transient ischemic deficits (12.5%), but significantly less in asymptomatic subjects (4.3%) (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence was maximal in patients examined within the first week after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HITS were significantly more often associated with severe (&gt; 70%) (23.5%) than with moderate (50 - 70%) internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (3.4%) (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These figures are closely related to annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk estimates recently reported about patients evaluated in multi-centre trials for carotid endarterectomy, and support the concept that HITS associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> represent an important individual risk predictor </plain></SENT>
