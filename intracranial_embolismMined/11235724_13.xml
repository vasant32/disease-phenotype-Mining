<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plaque fragments may initiate local <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, which, in turn, aggravates the embolic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prothrombotic genetic factors may exacerbate this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the PlA2 polymorphism of platelet GPIIIa, a prothrombotic risk factor in other cardiovascular settings, is associated with early neurocognitive decline after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neurocognitive changes were evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination administered preoperatively and on postoperative day 4 and the PlA genotype determined in 70 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were PlA1/A1, and 21 were PlA1/A2 or PlA2/A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two patients (74%) demonstrated post-cardiopulmonary bypass neurocognitive decline, of which 34 were PlA1/A1 and 18 were PlA1/A2 or PlA2/A2 Multivariate analysis revealed that the PlA2 genotype and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination were significantly associated with greater neurocognitive decline (decreased Mini-Mental State Examination scores, p = 0.036 and 0.024, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a link between the PlA2 allele of platelet GPIIIa and more severe neurocognitive decline after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism is unknown, it could represent exacerbation of platelet-dependent thrombotic processes associated with plaque embolism </plain></SENT>
