<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after carotid endareterectomy (CEA) is an event that should be managed according to a planned strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Literature data on this issue are not definitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our series in the attempt to define an algorithm of treatment if this complication occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 413 CEAs in 390 patients was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were performed under general anaesthesia and EEG monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An indwelling shunt was inserted only according to EEG changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct closure of the arteriotomy was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative ultrasound was not routinely employed before 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who suffered from the new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of an ischaemic hemispheric deficit or the worsening of a pre-existing deficit within 72 h after surgery were included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients (3.9%) suffered from perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven patients presented neurological deficits that rapidly and spontaneously resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In nine cases (2.2%) a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), with or without embolic blocking of the omolateral M1 segment, occurred in eight cases; in one case a patent ICA was associated with the occlusion of two frontal branches of the omolateral middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven cases were reoperated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The ICA was reopened in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases except one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among these seven cases, three (42%) had a good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after CEA is caused, in most of cases, by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICA occlusion with or without intracerebral embolic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Reopening of the occluded ICA gives good results when intracerebral vessels are patent and when the occluded ICA is satisfactorily reopened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>An algorithm of planned reactions in case of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is finally proposed </plain></SENT>
