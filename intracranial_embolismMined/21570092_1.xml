<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the pre-admission CHADS(2) score and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity or outcome was examined in AF-related cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 423 consecutive AF-related cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (250 men, 173 women; aged 76±10 years) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-admission CHADS(2) scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were present in 4.3%, 21.0%, 34.3%, 23.6%, 11.8%, 4.5%, and 0.5% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations (P&lt;0.001) between CHADS(2) and National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores on admission, and CHADS(2) and modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The optimal cutoff CHADS(2) score for an mRS score ≥3 was ≥2 (sensitivity 84%, specificity 38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, the optimal cutoff CHADS(2) score was ≥3 (sensitivity 59%, specificity 62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, a CHADS(2) score ≥2 was independently associated with an mRS score ≥3 (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.39-2.72, P&lt;0.001), and a CHADS(2) score ≥3 was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.02-2.11, P=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CHADS(2) score is related to severity and outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
