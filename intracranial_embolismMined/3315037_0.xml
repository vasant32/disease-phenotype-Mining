<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increase is of a transitory character and is accompanied by changes in the acid-base balance of the arterial blood towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been established that papaverine and cavinton (vinpocetine) do not cause recanalization of the blocked microvessels, and in case of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> it is of a partial character </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The infusion of prostacyclin brings about an almost total recanalization of microvessels and prevents intravascular aggregation upon collagen application </plain></SENT>
