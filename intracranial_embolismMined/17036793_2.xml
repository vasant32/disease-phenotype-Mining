<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An integrated system for acquisition and processing of intracranial and extracranial Doppler signals and automatic embolic signal detection has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hardware basis of the system is a purpose-built acquisition/processing board that includes a multigate Doppler unit controlled through a computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The signal-processing engine of the system contains a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based, spectral-analysis unit and an embolic signal-detection unit using expert system reasoning theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The system is designed so that up to four receive gates from a single transducer can be used to provide useful reasoning information to the embolic signal-detection unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, two transducers can be used simultaneously, either for bilateral transcranial Doppler (TCD) investigations or for simultaneous intra- and extracranial investigation of different arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The structure of the software will allow the future implementation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection algorithms that use the information from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four channels when a single transducer is used, or of independent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection in two sets of two channels when two transducers are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The user-friendly system has been tested in-vitro, and it has demonstrated a 93.6% sensitivity for micro-embolic signal (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preliminary in-vivo results also are encouraging </plain></SENT>
