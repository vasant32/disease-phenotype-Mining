<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A large unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was created in 21 monkeys, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the cisterna magna or left internal carotid artery in 3 others (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral fixation was performed on Day 14 after SAH or 15 minutes after HRP injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major cerebral arteries from both the nonclot (control) and clot sides and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals were examined with scanning and transmission electron microscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> and TEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> of the adventitial surfaces of control and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries revealed tunnel-like structures along the longitudinal axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No vasa vasorum were seen, but adventitial rounded openings were observed, 10 to 35 micron in diameter in vessels of the anterior circulation and up to 80 micron in diameter in the basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stomas, numbering 5 to 10/mm of specimen, appeared to connect the subarachnoid and intraadventitial spaces or pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SAH arteries, the tunica adventitia was coated with cellular remnants of <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> or dense, well-organized blood clots, the removal of which revealed blocked stomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TEM showed HRP in the vessel walls after injection into the cisterna magna, but not after injection into the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TEM of control arteries revealed Virchow-Robin (intraadventitial) spaces lined by simple planar epithelium-like cells; Virchow-Robin spaces contained sparse nerve fiber bundles and connective tissue fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In SAH arteries, these spaces were almost filled with strands of connective tissue and fibroblasts; no nerve fibers were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vasogenic substances probably reach smooth muscle cells via the adventitial stomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SAH occluding the stomas may block the cerebrospinal fluid circulation, disturbing nutrition of the arterial wall or removal of wastes from it, thereby aggravating vasospasm </plain></SENT>
