<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four years after resection of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e>, a 57-year-old man presented with recurrent episodes of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Head computer tomographic (CT) scans suggested <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>, and further investigations showed a potential anastomosis between a pulmonary air cavity and a pulmonary vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was treated surgically by debridement of the bronchovascular bundles surrounding the air cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient had no further neurologic deficits during 10 months of post-surgical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the absence of trauma, sinus disease, recent surgery, or vascular procedures, the presence of air in the brain is unusual, and pulmonary sources of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> should be considered </plain></SENT>
