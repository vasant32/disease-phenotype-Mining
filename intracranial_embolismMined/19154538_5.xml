<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is the major inhibitor of fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was reported that PAI-1 gene polymorphisms affected PAI-1 level and might therefore influence the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the association of three common polymorphisms in PAI-1 gene (-844 G/A, -675 4G/5G, and HindIII G/C) with the odds of different causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 390 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> due to large vessel disease (n = 117), small vessel disease (n = 121), and cardioembolism (n = 152) as well as 291 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was established using TOAST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PAI-1 polymorphisms were genotyped with restriction fragment length polymorphism and single strand conformation polymorphism method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A-G-4G haplotype of PAI-1 gene was found more frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with small vessel disease than in control subjects (44.9% vs 35.7%; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was found between investigated genotype or allele frequencies and distinct causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that A-G-4G PAI-1 gene haplotype is associated with increased risk of small vessel disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but this study does not support an association of -844 G/A, -675 4G/5G, and HindIII G/C PAI-1 gene polymorphisms with particular etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
