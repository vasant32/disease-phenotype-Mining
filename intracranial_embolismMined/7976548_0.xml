<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared DWI, the apparent diffusion constant (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), and autoradiographic cerebral blood flow (CBF) in a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were embolized with a single <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> cylinder injected into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both common carotids were permanently ligated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was assessed in various regions, including ischemic cortex and a region homologous to ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
