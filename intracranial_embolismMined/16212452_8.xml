<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid stenting with self-expanding nitinol stents was evaluated in 261 patients (157 men; mean age 70.9+/-9.7 years, range 41-90) treated at 33 clinical sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 141 (54.3%) were symptomatic, and 71 (27.2%) had postendarterectomy restenotic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection device became available in the latter third of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of the study was the 30-day composite occurrence of major adverse clinical events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> [MI]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, the endpoint included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, or MIs at 30 days, plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> between 31 days and 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SMART stents were placed in 147 (56%) patients and Precise stents in 107 (41%); 7 (3%) patients were treated with non-study stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesion success, defined as &lt;30% postprocedural residual stenosis, was achieved in 249 (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An AngioGuard filter was used in 85 patients; of 90 filters employed, 78 (87%) were successfully deployed and retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visible material was noted in 42 (54%) retrieved filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One (0.4%) stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred at &lt;30 days, and no restenotic lesions &gt;80% were noted in up to 1 year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 30 days, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 16 (6.1%) patients, MI in 1 (0.4%), and 2 (0.8%) patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 30-day rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, MI, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 6.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Major ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 4 (1.5%) patients between 0 and 30 days; no new major ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were noted up to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 1-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, MI, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 10.9%+/-2.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The 1-year risk of major ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was significantly lower in patients treated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection devices (0.0% versus 2.3%, p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of nitinol self-expanding stents in the carotid position appears to be a safe and efficacious alternative for the treatment of carotid bifurcation disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection devices may diminish the risk of postprocedural major ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
