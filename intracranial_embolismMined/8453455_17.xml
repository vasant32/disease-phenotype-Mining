<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow accurate anatomical localization of large thromboembolic cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the territories of the cerebellar arteries and their branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, MRI and CT show very small cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> as discrete foci of signal change that are not easily localizable within well-defined arterial territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They could be border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, mechanism and clinical features have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By reviewing our CT and MRI files over a 2-year period, we found 47 patients with very small cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; 23 patients had angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were cortical (32 patients), deep (10 patients) and both (five patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most lesions corresponded to border zone cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of infarction were (i) global hypoperfusion due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (two patients); (ii) small or end (pial) artery disease due to intracranial atheroma or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> (nine patients); (iii) focal cerebellar hypoperfusion due to large artery (vertebral or basilar) occlusive disease (16 patients) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> (11 patients) resulting in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the watershed areas (27 patients total); (iv) unknown mechanism (nine patients, 19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large artery occlusive disease was more frequently observed in deep than in cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (9 out of 15 versus 11 out of 37; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent symptoms were dizziness, lightheadedness, unsteadiness with axial lateropulsion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and limb <z:hpo ids='HP_0002312'>clumsiness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These symptoms were either transient or recurrent, at times related to positional changes of the head or trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Position-related symptoms often persisted for weeks or months after the ischaemic event, and occurred mainly in patients with combined carotid and vertebrobasilar occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Physical findings were either absent or included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002136'>wide-based gait</z:hpo>, lateropulsion, mild ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002075'>dysdiadochokinesia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that very small cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are often found on CT and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Their border zone distribution and frequent posturally related symptoms most often result from large or pial artery disease rather than from systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
