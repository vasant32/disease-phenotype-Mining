<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was aimed at further investigating the circadian and circannual patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study design and type of participants: 977 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (475 in men and 502 in women) concerning 926 subjects (457 men and 469 women) admitted to Ferrara Hospital in two calendar years (1990-1991), were prospectively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were classified as based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (CH: subarachnoid and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two statistical models of analysis were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assessment of circadian and circannual periodicity was performed utilizing the single cosinor method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A separate analysis was performed after distribution of events into 6-hour intervals, and chi-square test for fit was applied to the number of observed versus expected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in the morning between 7 a.m. and noon (35% of cases) and the hypothesis of a uniform distribution of the time <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was rejected on the basis of the chi-square for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A circadian rhythm was found for CI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> with acrophase at the 11.56 and 12.41 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also a circannual periodicity was found for CI with a prevalent peak in October </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The spectral analysis detected a circadian cycle for CH having a period of 4 h, and a circannual cycle for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> with a period of 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a high-chrono-risk disease, with specific circadian and circannual rhythms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is very important for a better understanding and control of the underlying factors and in terms of prevention </plain></SENT>
