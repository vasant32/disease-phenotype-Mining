<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether these events correlate with middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred sixty-three patients with ipsilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (&gt;70%) underwent carotid endarterectomy under transcranial Doppler monitoring of mean blood flow velocity and microembolic signals in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis of several variables demonstrated that only middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity during carotid dissection was significantly associated with new postoperative neurological deficits in patients with microembolic signals during carotid dissection (95% CI, 1.069 to 1.528; P=0.0072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of low middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity (&lt;or=28 cm/s) and microembolic signals &gt;or=10 during carotid dissection resulted in improved specificity and positive predictive value for the development of new postoperative neurological deficits when compared with either criterion used alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative microemboli and low middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity are additive in predicting the development of cerebral ischemic events after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
