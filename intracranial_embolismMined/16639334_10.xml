<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Carotid plaque rupture is one of the main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by creating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biochemical, molecular, and structural factors that promote carotid plaque rupture are not yet understood in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that increased microvascular blood flow within a carotid plaque might fissure the plaque, elevate local pressure, and promote plaque rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine the role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-related gene expression in symptomatic carotid plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study evaluated the new vessel formation (using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining and CD34 immunohistochemistry) and angiogenic gene expression (using microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis) in carotid plaque specimens obtained during endarterectomy from 13 symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in comparison with eight asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptomatic plaques showed significantly higher new vessel density in the fibrous cap (by 347%, P &lt; 0.05) as well as in the plaque proper (by 196%, P &lt; 0.05) compared with the asymptomatic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fibrous caps of the plaques were threefold thinner in the symptomatic patients when compared with the asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic plaque, gene expression analysis showed increased abundance of 31 transcripts known to promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and cell division compared with plaques of asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that angiogenic gene expression and the ensuing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the plaques might contribute to their destabilization and resulting symptoms </plain></SENT>
