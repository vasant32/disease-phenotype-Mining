<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, very seldom single (2 /12), spared the subolivary levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pontomedullary junction was affected in 3 /9 cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesions were more frequent in the ventral part of the arterial zonal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They more often extended to its dorsal part at the level of the middle and upper one-third of the olive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, seldom single (6/30), extended to the subolivary levels in 6/22 cases studied and to the pontomedullary junction in 9/24 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The structures involved in each case and the area of the lesions at each cranio-caudal level have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 7 dorsal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was single; in 6 of these cases there was also a cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> involving the area of supply of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subolivary levels (1/6) and ponto-medullary junctions (1/6) were seldom affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extent of the lesions in these uncommon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> has been described in detail </plain></SENT>
