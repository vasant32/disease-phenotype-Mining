<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used bilateral transcranial Doppler to monitor the number of microembolic events (ME) in the left and right middle cerebral arteries of 29 patients during cardiac surgery that required extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on a previously published study, we hypothesized that the commonly used method of doubling unilateral ME counts to obtain an estimated bihemispheric load would result in significant errors of estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our sample, estimated bihemispheric counts were inaccurate by an average of 18% (range 0--80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite this large range of error, calculation of Cronbach's alpha revealed that actual error due to unreliability (4%) was small relative to the large variation in ME counts across subjects in this patient series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that unilateral monitoring is sufficient when the goal is to characterize a given subject's ME load within the context of the other subjects in the sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when precise ME counts are required, bilateral monitoring is essential </plain></SENT>
