<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the outcomes of CAS with these two broad categories of stents in a single-center retrospective review of 308 CAS procedures from May 2001 to July 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nitinol self-expanding TS or NTS coupled with cerebral embolic protection devices were used to treat extracranial carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data analysis included demographics, procedural records, duplex exams, and conventional arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 18 months (range 1-69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Restenosis was defined as &gt;or=80% in-stent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the entire cohort was 71.3 years (75% men, 25% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 308 cases, 233 were de novo lesions and 75 had a prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (n = 44) or external beam radiation exposure (n = 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preprocedure neurological symptoms were present in 30% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TS were used in 156 procedures and NTS in 152 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 30-day ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates were 1.3% and 0.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An additional three (1.0%) posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in the 30-day total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates between TS (3.2%, n = 5) and NTS (1.3%, n = 2) (p = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At midterm follow-up, restenosis or asymptomatic occlusion was detected in eight cases (2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> occurred in arteries treated with NTS, and this was statistically different when compared to arteries treated with TS (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a post-hoc subgroup analysis revealed significant correlation (chi(2) = 0.02) for restenosis in "hostile necks" when separated by TS vs. NTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early CAS outcomes between TS and NTS are comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In contrast, self-expanding nitinol TS may have a lower incidence of significant restenosis or asymptomatic occlusion when compared to NTS </plain></SENT>
