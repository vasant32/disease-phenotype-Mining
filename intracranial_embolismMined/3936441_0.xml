<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgery consisted in simple aortic valve replacement (35 cases), simple mitral valve replacement (12 cases), double aortic and mitral valve replacement (2 cases), valve replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery (3 cases), aortic valve replacement and replacement of the ascending aorta (1 case) and mitral valve replacement and tricuspid annuloplasty (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality (within 30 days of surgery) was 3.5% (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed by clinical examination, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiogram and laboratory investigations on average 19 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 3 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No cases of significant haemolysis were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the valve or any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> directly related to the valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (4.9% per patient/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None were fatal and only 1 patient had sequellae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement was very significant; 96% of the patients are now in the NYHA Classes I and II whilst 80% were in Class III or IV before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cardiothoracic ratio decreased significantly from 0.56 to 0.51 (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that elderly patients may derive great benefits from valvular cardiac surgery and that age in itself is not a contraindication to this type of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The St Jude Medical prosthesis is an excellent prosthesis but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> remains a major problem as with other mechanical prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation for life is essential </plain></SENT>
