<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study, 178 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to Royal Perth Hospital were assessed by 4 neurologists; 150 cranial CT scans were performed and these were reviewed by an independent radiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT lesion characteristics were cross-tabulated against clinical indices of patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesions greater than 50 cm3 in volume were associated with a 23% mortality compared to a 5% mortality for lesions smaller than 50 cm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate from intracerebral haemorrhage was 25% compared to 9% for other disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of patients whose CT scan showed a mass effect, 35% had an altered mental state at discharge compared to only 2% of those without a mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with deep white matter lesions, 35% had an altered mental state at discharge compared to only 13% of patients with lesions in other sites, and only 50% were discharged home compared to 77% of patients with lesions in other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT scan features that correlated significantly with a poor outcome following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were large lesion size, intracerebral haemorrhage, mass effect and deep white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
