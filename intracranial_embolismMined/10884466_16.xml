<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> can be identified by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) with the use of contrast agents and a Valsalva maneuver (VM) as provocation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, data on the appropriate timing of the VM, the use of a diagnostic time window, and a threshold in contrast agent microbubbles detected are insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were investigated by both TEE and bilateral TCD of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following protocol with injections of 10 mL of the commercial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-based contrast agent Echovist was applied in a randomized way: (1) no VM, (2) VM for 5 seconds starting 2 seconds after the beginning of contrast injection, (3) VM for 5 seconds starting 5 seconds after the beginning of contrast injection, (4) VM for 5 seconds starting 8 seconds after the beginning of contrast injection, and (5) repetitive short VMs in between 2 and 13 seconds after the beginning of contrast injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the single tests, we also tested the sensitivity and specificity of combined results of the tests with VM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 21 patients, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> was demonstrated by TEE and contrast TCD (shunt positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were negative in both investigations, no patient was positive on TEE and negative on TCD, and 16 patients were only positive on at least 1 TCD investigation but negative during TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Test 3 was the most appropriate test when combined with the results of 1 of the other tests with VM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest sensitivities were achieved with a diagnostic time window of 40 seconds and when the presence of a single microbubble was sufficient for the diagnosis of a shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD performed twice with 2 provocation maneuvers with Echovist is a sensitive method to identify TEE-proven cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The VM should be performed for 5 seconds starting at 5 seconds after the beginning of contrast injection </plain></SENT>
