<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo>, for which they were receiving inadequate anticoagulation, were excluded from the study, and 18 patients were subsequently found to have a non-embolic cause for their cerebral pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clinical examination, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram, and 27 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> alone had echocardiograms which did not reveal a cardiac source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining group of 33 patients, six were found to have a probable cardiac source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and nine had abnormalities which may be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography may not be indicated in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clinical examination, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram, and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, if these patients are excluded echocardiography gives a high yield of positive findings which may be of practical importance in the management of the patient </plain></SENT>
