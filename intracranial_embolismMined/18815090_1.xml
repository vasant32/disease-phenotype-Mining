<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Registration of 3-D ultrasound (US) images of carotid plaque obtained at different time points is essential for sensitive monitoring of plaque changes in volume and surface <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This registration technique should be nonrigid, since different head positions during image acquisition sessions cause relative bending and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> in the neck, producing nonlinear deformations between the images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We modeled the movement of the neck using a "twisting and bending" model with only six parameters for nonrigid registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the algorithm using 3-D US carotid images acquired at two different head positions to simulate images acquired at different times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We calculated the mean registration error (MRE) between the segmented vessel surfaces in the target image and the registered image using a distance-based error metric after applying our "twisting and bending" model-based nonrigid registration algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We achieved an average registration error of 0.80 +/-0.26 mm using our nonrigid registration technique, which was a significant improvement in registration accuracy over rigid registration, even with reduced degrees-of-freedom compared to the other nonrigid registration algorithms </plain></SENT>
