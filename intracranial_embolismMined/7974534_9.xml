<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These emboli may be a risk factor for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of microemboli in patients referred for echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were studied with continuous monitoring over one middle cerebral artery for 30 minutes, and the number of microemboli was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups, those with prosthetic heart valves (group A, n = 15), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (group B, n = 14), and no major cardiac risk factor (group C, n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen percent (7 of 42) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group A, 5 of 15 (33%) had microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group B, 2 of 13 (15%) patients had microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five percent (7 of 28) of patients in groups A and B combined (A+B) had microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients (0 of 14) in group C had microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Groups A and A+B had significantly more emboli than group C (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prosthetic heart valve patients with emboli more commonly had a history of prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than valve patients without emboli (3 of 5 versus 2 of 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The number of emboli seen per 30-minute monitoring session was greater in patients with a prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than in patients without (10 microemboli versus 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microemboli can be found in a significant percentage of selected patients referred for echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of microembolism is greater in patients with a known high risk of embolization (eg, prosthetic valves) and less in patients with a lower risk of embolization (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These microemboli may be associated with an increased prevalence of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with prosthetic valves </plain></SENT>
