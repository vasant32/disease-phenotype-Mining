<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A possible association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">giant Lambl excrescences</z:e> (LEs) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the treatment of giant LEs is controversial because minimal data are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the management of giant LEs through a clinicopathologic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE SERIES: Three young patients (2 women and 1 man) who experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of general examinations were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, as were chest x-ray films, electrocardiograms, ultrasonograms of the neck, and cerebral angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extensive serological and blood testing failed to show any <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo> or systemic disorders that favored a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography showed a mitral valve lesion (width, &gt; 1 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients (cases 1 and 3) were discharged on a regimen of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and sequential transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring was planned, whereas 1 patient (case 2) was promptly scheduled for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in patients 1 and 3 at 3 and 6 months, respectively, thus leading to surgery in these 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings from histopathologic studies were consistent with the diagnosis of giant LEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients' outcomes were uneventful after surgery, and none had a recurrence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A relationship between giant LEs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients who have transesophageal echocardiographic findings that are consistent with this diagnosis and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> despite antithrombotic therapy and without an alternative explanation for the ischemic symptoms, surgery should be considered in view of these findings </plain></SENT>
