<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 77-year-old female was referred to our hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo> and an abnormal shadow on her chest X ray film </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and aortography revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the distal aortic arch and the infrarenal abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total aortic arch replacement was performed successfully on the patient, utilizing hypothermic selective cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operation employed three technical characteristics for avoidance of cerebral complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those were as follows: First, total aortic arch replacement was performed instead of distal aortic arch replacement because of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> of the proximal aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondly, to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> due to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> on the wall of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, an arterial cannula for cardiopulmonary bypass was inserted in the ascending aorta initially and after completion of the distal anastomosis, it was placed on the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, the so called "non clamping technique" operation was employed because clamping onto the sclerotic arteries might have caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no cerebral complication and the postoperative course was satisfactory </plain></SENT>
