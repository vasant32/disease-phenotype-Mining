<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001855'>atrial thrombosis</z:mp> was present in 32 of them, yet the diagnosis was suspected or established preoperatively in only 12, because of insufficient clinical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A transventricular mitral commissurotomy was performed in 32 patients and mitral valve replacement in the remaining 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical mortality was 23% in the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001855'>atrial thrombosis</z:mp> compared with 7% in the trombus-free patients: 66% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001855'>Atrial thrombosis</z:mp> increases the surgical risk because of the high incidence of operative embolism, a complication that is not avoided by the use of open procedures, but that could be prevented by earlier surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo>, before atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> develop </plain></SENT>
