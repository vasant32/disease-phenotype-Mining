<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine children and 43 adults with ATS valves implanted in the aortic position were monitored over both middle cerebral arteries with transcranial Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were identified on-line according to standard criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heart rate and rhythm, valve type, size and duration, patients' height, International Normalized Ratio, and prevalence of neurological complications were obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> prevalence and counts were significantly higher in children compared with adult patients (100% versus 25.5% and 58 [18.5 to 115.5] versus 55 [2 to 10.5], median, 95% CI, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No corresponding differences in valve duration of valve implant were evident, but children has heart rates and were significantly smaller compared with adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between patients' size, heart rate, and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts in children with mechanical prosthetic valves are significantly higher compared with those in corresponding adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that this is due to (1) the shorter distance between aortic valve and middle cerebral artery, since cavitation bubbles have a <z:mp ids='MP_0002083'>short life span</z:mp> and are bound to dissolve with time, and (2) the faster heart rate in children, resulting in a higher number of valve closures per minute </plain></SENT>
