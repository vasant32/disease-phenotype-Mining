<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many patients who undergo cardiac surgery assisted with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) experience cerebral injury, and microemboli are thought to play a role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because an increased duration of CPB is associated with an increased risk of subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e>, we investigated whether cerebral microemboli were also more numerous with a longer duration of CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brain specimens were obtained from 36 patients who died within 3 weeks after CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens were embedded in celloidin, sectioned 100 microm thick, and stained for endogenous alkaline phosphatase, which outlines arterioles and capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In such preparations, emboli can be seen as swellings in the vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli were counted in equal areas and scored as small, medium, or large to estimate the embolic load (volume of emboli) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With increasing survival time after CPB, the embolic load declined (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> emboli are known to pump slowly through the brain.) Also with increasing time after CPB, the percentage of large and medium emboli became lower (P=0.0034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This decline is consistent with the concept that the emboli break into smaller globules as they pass through the capillary network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A longer duration of CPB was associated with increased embolic load (P=0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>0026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For each 1-hour increase in the duration of CPB, the embolic load increased by 90.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thousands of microemboli were found in the brains of patients soon after CPB, and an increasing duration of CPB was associated with an increasing embolic load </plain></SENT>
