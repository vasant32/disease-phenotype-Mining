<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial sections of the involved basal ganglia were studied in ten <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and only a gross dissection was made in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The implicated penetrating arteries were traced throughout their length and obstructive vascular lesions were found in nine instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two of the nine there was an atheromatous plaque with a superimposed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, in four an atheromatous plaque had caused severe stenosis, in one a destructive arterial process lipohyalinosis had occurred, in one case the nature of the obstruction remained "uncertained," and in one the penetrating arteries were obstructed at their orifices by an atheroma in the superior division of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two cases the vessels were patent, suggesting embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The atheromas consisted almost exclusively of a conglomerate of fat-filled macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical correlate was a pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> involving the face, arm, and leg without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficit</z:e>, homonymous hemianopia, receptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">apractognosia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>Confusion</z:hpo> was prominent in one patient </plain></SENT>
