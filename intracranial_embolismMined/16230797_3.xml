<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND DESIGN: In this study we have investigated the association of this pathogen and noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> under a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIAL: Samples are taken among patients who were admitted in our hospital due to their first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> during 2003-04 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a known cardiac origin for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and those with major risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls were selected from the study population and matched for age, sex, and area of residence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgA antibodies to H. pylori were measured by enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The t and c - tests and Odds ratio were applied to examine variables differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 91 cases (43 women, 48 men) and 80 controls (40 women, 40 men) were included for analysis (P = 0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age of cases was 64.3+/-10 years and of controls was 61.73 +/- 10.3 years (P = 0.1, CI = 95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was seropositivity for H. pylori (IgG or IgA) in 66 patients (72.5%) but they were positive only in 45 controls (56.3%) (P =0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean of serum IgG levels was significantly high in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group (P &lt; 0.005) but the IgA antibody elevation against H. pylori did not show any risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our case-control study provides evidence of an association between the immune response to H. pylori , a marker of prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with this organism and noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
