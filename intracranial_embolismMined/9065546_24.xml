<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare echo-planar imaging with signal targeting and alternating radiofrequency (EPISTAR), an arterial spin-labeling technique, to a T2*-weighted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced (T2*-WGE) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion technique for the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twenty-one EPISTAR and T2*-WGE perfusion studies were performed on 18 patients with the clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (12 men, 6 women, age range 34 to 89 years, mean age 68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For qualitative analysis, perfusion studies of both techniques were grouped into categories (hyperperfusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion, delayed perfusion, or absent perfusion) and compared with a Wilcoxon signed rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis was performed using signal intensity measurements in a region of interest that was defined by diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These signal intensity measurements were compared with a mirror region in the contralateral unaffected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Signal intensity ratios (infarcted region versus the unaffected contralateral region) were calculated and compared using a paired t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Qualitative analysis demonstrated agreement between the two techniques in 17 of 21 studies (hyperfusion, n = 3 patients; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion, n = 3; delayed perfusion, n = 4; and absent perfusion, n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four studies, the two techniques disagreed when EPISTAR demonstrated absent and T2*-WGE perfusion demonstrated delayed perfusion (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis revealed a mean signal intensity ratio of 0.73 +/- 0.79 for the T2*-WGE perfusion technique and 0.69 +/- 0.68 for the EPISTAR technique (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The noninvasive EPISTAR technique can assess perfusion abnormalities similarly to the T2*-WGE perfusion technique and may provide a valuable alternative in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences between the two techniques can be explained by the applied inflow times in the EPISTAR technique </plain></SENT>
