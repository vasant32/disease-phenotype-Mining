<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood specimens were obtained before and at intervals of 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the intravenous administration of 500 microgram of TRH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum TSH was measured using the RIA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, the serum TSH level before TRH administration was 1.0 +/- 1.4 microunits/ml (MEAN +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the intravenous administration of TRH, serum TSH increased and reached the maximum level of 9.0 +/- 2.3 microunits/mil at 30 minutes and returned near to the original level at 120 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response was the same for both male &amp; female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, the response of serum TSH to TRH was variable, including the types of excess, delayed or low response besides the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In severe cases, cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and male patients, a marked variability in the response was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, a low response of serum TSH to TRH was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference of the response with regard to severity of the diseases, duration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or sex difference of the patients </plain></SENT>
