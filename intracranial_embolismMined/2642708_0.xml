<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case that illustrates that it is possible for an infant to survive the immediate cardiovascular consequences of such an event; however, we demonstrate that embolic extension into the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) can occur as an associated sequela, and we offer the first published documentation (cranial ultrasonography) of this potentially pivotal complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The temporal relationships between our patient's initial (but resolving) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> and his subsequent (and persistent) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> event are documented and the implications discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, we caution that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement is difficult to recognize clinically and suggest that such involvement may contribute to a fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, it appears that it may be possible to intervene in future cases to improve outcome, and we offer suggestions in this regard </plain></SENT>
