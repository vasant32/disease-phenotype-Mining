<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The initiating event in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, especially the role played by vasospasm, remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently an angiographic sequence of events has been reported which should conclusively prove that spasm of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary artery might lead to occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient survived, and thus this conclusion was reached without morphological verification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present report describes an almost identical angiographic sequence of events in a cerebral artery initially interpreted in the same way: spasm leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient died, and an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> derived from the angiographic catheter was found at postmortem examination exactly where angiography had shown "spasm" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A "catheter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>" simulating vascular spasm could as well explain the basic angiographic findings in the previously reported case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, it still remains to be proved that spasm of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> artery may lead to occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
