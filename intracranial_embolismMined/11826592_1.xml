<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors sought to determine the nature of such microemboli, that is, whether they are gaseous or solid, by comparing their characteristics to those of artificially generated air emboli in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and forty-eight microemboli were recorded in 11 patients with artificial valves (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi>), and 86 microemboli were recorded in response to intravenous injection of saline agitated with air in 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No difference in intensity, duration, or relative velocity of microemboli was found between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that microemboli generated from artificial heart valves are generally gaseous and not solid </plain></SENT>
