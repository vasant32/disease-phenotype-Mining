<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dimensions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>), the presence and characteristics of interatrial shunt, the movement of the wall of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and correlation between these findings and sign and/or symptoms suggesting embolism in Manisa, a district of a western Anatolian city of Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two thousand five hundred cases were examined by routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in both pediatric and adult cardiology outpatient clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was detected in 20 cases and evaluated by two-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography (CDE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The length of the base, the maximum radius and the maximum displacement of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The shunt between the atria was examined by CDE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cases where a shunt could not be found, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi> was injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and exercise stress test were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No clinical signs or symptoms were found, suggesting a systemic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximum displacement of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was between 2 and 5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were localized in the right atrium, and the walls of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> did not move beyond the base of the left atrium during the maximum displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interatrial shunt was detected in 14 of 20 patients (70%) by CDE and in the remaining six cases by contrast TTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular ectopic beats</z:mp> were observed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During routine TTE we observed 0.8% asymptomatic <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The use of a contrast agent was found to be a valuable additional method in patients with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> when the shunt could not be detected by CDE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The risk for embolism is not high when the maximum displacement of the wall of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was 5 mm or less and no bulge into the left atrium was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Based on our experience with this method, TTE is easy to perform, well-tolerated and acceptable </plain></SENT>
