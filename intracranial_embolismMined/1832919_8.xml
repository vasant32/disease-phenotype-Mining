<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial success was obtained in 4 of the 6 stenoses (2 subclavian and both innominate) but in none of the 3 occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of the 4 subclavian stenoses were located proximal to the vertebral artery origin and antegrade vertebral flow without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal</z:e> was present in 2 of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had complications during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of them developed symptoms and signs of cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both had shown antegrade vertebral flow and no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal</z:e> in the initial angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 4 to 18 months (mean 10.8 months) and no re-stenosis was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty appears suitable for management of a selected group of patients with nonocclusive lesions in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal phenomenon</z:e> is evident in the initial diagnostic angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients with antegrade vertebral flow are at a high risk of cerebral embolization during angioplasty </plain></SENT>
