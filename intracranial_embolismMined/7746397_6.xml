<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after early anticoagulation in nonseptic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> is related to clinical severity and infarction size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Explicit clinical criteria and timing of anticoagulation after large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarctions</z:e> are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Out of 171 patients receiving anticoagulation between July 1992 and December 1993, 83 patients with hemispheric embolisms received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> within 72 hours from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] 1.5 times control value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stratified by age and sex, a "high-risk" group (46 patients) was defined as those having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms involving three or more <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> domains, Mathew Scale score &lt; or = 74, or hemorrhagic infarction on initial CT, and a "low-risk" group (37 patients) as those having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms involving fewer than three cortical domains, or Mathew Scale score &gt; 74, and CT showing no blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>Loss of consciousness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, or history of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeated CTs (100%) and MRIs (36%) detailed infarctions according to standard maps and evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unexplained clinical worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prior to therapy, high-risk patients had more severe clinical deficits (p &lt; 0.01), larger infarctions on CT (p &lt; 0.01), and more mass effect (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic conversion (26% in the high-risk group versus 22% in the low-risk group) and hemorrhagic worsening (4% in the high-risk group versus 13% in the low-risk group) were unrelated to admission clinical severity or infarction size, but they were related to an excessive prolongation of the aPTT (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infarction size and clinical severity in alert patients with nonseptic embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> carries no additional <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications after early anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> are deemed necessary, treatment delay seems unjustified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, rigorous monitoring of the aPTT is strongly advised to keep the level at 1.5 to 2 times control values </plain></SENT>
