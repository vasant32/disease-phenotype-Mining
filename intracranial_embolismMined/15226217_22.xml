<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The fibrous cap of atherosclerotic plaques is composed predominantly of type I and III collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unstable carotid plaques are characterized by rupture of their cap, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proteolytic mechanisms causing plaque disruption are undefined, but the collagenolytic matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -1, -8, and -13 may be implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to quantify the concentrations of these collagenases in carotid plaques and to determine their relationship to markers of plaque instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Atherosclerotic plaques were collected from 159 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence and timing of carotid territory symptoms were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative embolization was recorded by transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each plaque was assessed for histological features of instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plaque MMP concentrations were quantified with ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher concentrations of active MMP-8 were observed in the plaques of symptomatic patients (20.5 versus 11.4 ng/g; P=0.0002), in plaques of emboli-positive patients (22.7 versus 13.5 ng/g; P=0.0037), and in those plaques showing histological evidence of rupture (20.8 versus 14.7 ng/g; P=0.0036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No differences were seen in the levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and colocalization studies confirmed the presence of MMP-8 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> within the plaque, which colocalized with macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the active form of MMP-8 may be partly responsible for degradation of the collagen cap of atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This enzyme represents an attractive target for drug therapy aimed at stabilizing vulnerable plaques </plain></SENT>
