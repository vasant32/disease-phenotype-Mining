<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number and size spectrum of crystals, which were infused into the ipsilateral internal carotid artery, were believed to approximate those released by a rupturing large atheromatous plaque in man, but the other <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> materials contained in such plaques were intentionally excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that cholesterol crystals had only limited ability to impede blood flow in the 20--80 mu diameter arteries in view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were also inert within the lumen, causing no vessel wall reaction even after a week; nor was any evidence seen of a thrombogenic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local caliber changes in the containing artery were reproducibly seen, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the arterial segment proximal to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and narrowing of the segment in front </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes appeared to represent an active response of the vessel wall, rather than a passive response to alterations in intraluminal pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difficulty in subsequently locating cholesterol emboli histologically was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possible therapeutic implications for atheroembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in man were discussed </plain></SENT>
