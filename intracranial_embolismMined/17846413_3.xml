<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic strokes</z:hpo> have been sporadically described but are not well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to review the pathophysiologic relationship between primary systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and to determine how often <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is the first defining manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study of 49 patients with confirmed primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> included patients had biopsy proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic strokes</z:hpo> occurred in 13 patients (32.5%) as the initial presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presentation had the worst outcome, with average survival of 6.9 months after established diagnosis with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> developed 9.6 months before diagnosis with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven percent experienced recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority (70%) of patients had cardioembolic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is an underappreciated complication of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the absence of obvious clinical and cardiogenic manifestations, primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> should be considered when echocardiography demonstrates thickening of the valves, restrictive pattern, and increased echogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic strokes</z:hpo> as an initial presentation of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> carries a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
