<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that the immunoglobulins, with some exceptions, were fractionated in the G-zone which was defined as an area between the origin and 0.57 in terms of relative migration based on transferrin (RT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourty-four percent of the whole Bence Jones protein bands which were examined were detected in the area of RT 0.70-0.90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of CSF protein fractions were (means+/-SD):Pre-alb-zone, 10.97+/-2.31%; Alb-zone, 40.74+/-5.72%; A1-zone, 5.25+/-0.72%; A2-zone, 8.23+/-1.24%; B1-zone, 10.82+/-2.18% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following significant results were obtained: (1) When the total protein concentration (TP) of CSF is increased: the percentage of the Pre-alb-zone is lowered and that of the A1- and G-zones is increased in diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027927" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurosyphilis</z:e>, infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumour</z:e>, multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PID">intervertebral disc protrusion</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The A2-zone was diminished in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and a similar change was seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumour</z:e> with in addition a decrease of the B2-zone; (2) When the TP was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>: the percentage of the G-zone was increased in multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumour</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PID">intervertebral disc protrusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
