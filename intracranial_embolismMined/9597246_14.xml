<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of the available data are based on analyses of mixed populations of patients including intravenous drug users or those with prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> or native valve IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the Duke criteria to compare the characteristics of 44 episodes of definite native valve IE in elderly patients (&gt; 64 years old) with the characteristics of 64 similarly defined episodes of native valve IE in younger, nonintravenous-drug-using adult patients (&gt; 29 years and &lt; 60 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the clinical presentation, characteristics, and outcome of native valve IE are similar for elderly patients and younger adult patients, although elderly patients were hospitalized an average of 12 days longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although we found that the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during an episode of IE was associated with higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (odds ratios, 4.8 and 4.0, respectively), age was not a significant contributor to mortality </plain></SENT>
