<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data are available on its use in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the baseline characteristics, complications, and outcomes between intra-arterially treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients aged &gt; or = 80 years and their younger counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients aged &gt; or = 80 years (n = 33) were compared retrospectively with contemporaneous patients aged &lt; 80 years (n = 81) from a registry of consecutive patients treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis over a 9-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The very elderly and younger cohorts were very similar in baseline characteristics, including pretreatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale [NIHSS] 17 versus 16), differing only in history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (42% versus 22%, P = .01) and weight (66.8 versus 75.8 kg; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in recanalization (TIMI 2-3) rates could not be detected between the very elderly and younger patients (79% versus 68%, P = .10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of major symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (7% versus 8%) and any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (39% versus 37%) did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcomes at 90 days showed lower rates of excellent functional outcome (mRS &lt; or = 1, 26% versus 40%, P = .02) and survival (57% versus 80%, P = .01) among the very elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterial fibrinolysis in the elderly can be accomplished with recanalization rates and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rates equal to that in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although mortality rates are higher and good functional outcomes are lower than in younger persons, nondisabling outcomes may be achieved in a quarter of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the investigation and use of intra-arterial thrombolytic treatment in very elderly patients should not be avoided but pursued judiciously </plain></SENT>
