<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In experiment 1 we used in vitro optimization of clot visualization using multiple MRI contrast agents in concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 μL in 250 μL blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, we used in vivo characterization of the time course of clot lysis using the clot developed in the previous experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion, perfusion, angiography, and T1-weighted MRI for clot imaging were conducted before and during treatment with vehicle (n=6), tPA (n=8), or rA2 plus tPA (n=8) at multiple time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains were removed for ex vivo clot localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clots created with 25 μL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">Magnevist</z:chebi> were the most stable and provided the highest contrast-to-noise ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the vehicle group, clot length as assessed by T1-weighted imaging correlated with histology (r=0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clot length and cerebral blood flow-derived ischemic lesion volume were significantly smaller than vehicle at 15 minutes after treatment initiation in the rA2 plus tPA group, whereas in the tPA group no significant reduction from vehicle was observed until 30 minutes after treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rA2 plus tPA group had a significantly shorter clot length than the tPA group at 60 and 90 minutes after treatment initiation and significantly smaller cerebral blood flow deficit than the tPA group at 90 minutes after treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We introduce a novel MRI-based clot imaging method for in vivo monitoring of clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lytic efficacy of tPA was enhanced by rA2 </plain></SENT>
