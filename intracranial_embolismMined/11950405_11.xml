<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and characteristics of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients with aneurysmal SAH were monitored with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography for the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each middle cerebral artery was monitored for 30 minutes three times each week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded if they had traumatic SAH or cardiac or arterial sources of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monitoring was initiated 6.3 days (1-16 d) after SAH and lasted 6.6 days (1-13 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven individuals without SAH or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other cerebrovascular diseases</z:e> who were treated in the same unit served as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent monitoring of both middle cerebral arteries a mean of three times; therefore, 46 vessels were studied (a total of 138 observations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control subjects underwent assessment of each middle cerebral artery once, for a total of 22 control vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected for 16 of 23 patients (70%) and 44 of 138 patient vessels (32%) monitored, compared with 2 of 11 control subjects (18%) and 2 of 22 control vessels (9%) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were observed for 83% of patients with clinical vasospasm and 54% of those without clinical vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonographic vasospasm was observed for 71 of 138 vessels monitored; <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were observed for 28% of vessels with vasospasm and 36% of those without vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> proximal to the monitored artery were identified in 38 of 138 vessels, of which 34% exhibited <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, which is similar to the frequency for vessels without proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Coiled, clipped, and unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> exhibited similar frequencies of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were common in SAH, occurring in 70% of cases of SAH and one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vessels monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were more frequent among patients with clinical vasospasm, this difference did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We were unable to demonstrate a relationship between ultrasonographic vasospasm and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, and the presence of a proximal secured or unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> did not alter the chance of detection of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to determine the origin and clinical relevance of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in SAH </plain></SENT>
