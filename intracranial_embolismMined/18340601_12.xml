<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, faces may be "special" stimuli, for which we have developed unique modular perceptual and recognition processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of the strongest evidence for face processing being modular comes from cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010528'>prosopagnosia</z:hpo>, where patients are unable to recognize faces whilst retaining the ability to recognize other objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we present the case of an acquired prosopagnosic whose poor recognition was linked to a perceptual impairment in face processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite this, she had intact object recognition, even at a subordinate level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She also showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ability to learn and to generalize learning of nonfacial exemplars differing in the nature and arrangement of their parts, along with impaired learning and generalization of facial exemplars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The case provides evidence for modular perceptual processes for faces </plain></SENT>
