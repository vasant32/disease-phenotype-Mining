<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can occur after many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> without distinct angiographic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To confirm and explain these clinical experiences, the present study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, 20-min, 30-min and 1-h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was performed in each of 5 cats, and pial arterial behavior, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and infarction were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 20-min occlusion group, no abnormal change was found 5 hours after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 30-min occlusion group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> was present in 10.5 +/- 4.2% of the hemisphere, but no infarction was observed, and pial arterial caliber remained in a 10% dilated state throughout the experimental periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 1-h occlusion group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> was present in 41.2 +/- 7.5% of the hemisphere and infarction was found in 34.5 +/- 9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pial arteries returned to a 20% dilated state but redilated by 45% at the end of experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As the second experiment, three 20-min occlusions at 1-h interval and two 30-min occlusions at 1-h interval were performed in each 10 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pial arteries had dilated by 40% after release of the last occlusion in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> was 19.5 +/- 8.1% of hemisphere in the 20-min occlusions group and 36.6 +/- 9.7% in the 30 min occlusions group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
