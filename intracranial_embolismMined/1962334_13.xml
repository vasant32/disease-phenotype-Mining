<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a disorder associated with aging, experimental studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are conducted in young adult (2-4-month-old) animals (rat life span, 27-29 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether histopathologic changes caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> would be altered in aged animals, we produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262004" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic cerebral infarction</z:e> in 17 aged (23-24-month-old) and 16 young (2-4-month-old) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The right common carotid artery was irradiated with a laser (632 nm, 200 mW/cm2, 15-20 minutes) after the intravenous injection of the photosensitizing dye Photofrin II (12.5 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This produces a nonocclusive platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> that spontaneously embolizes to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed 4 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis was done on 142 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, 68 in aged rats and 74 in young rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypercellularity, with infiltration of macrophages, was more common within small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (less than 1 mm) in young than in aged rats (p = 0.002), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of astroglial fibers surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was more prominent in young rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (greater than or equal to 1 mm) were often hypocellular, with a trend toward more macrophages in the periphery of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in young than in old animals (p = 0.170) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The infiltration of macrophages into cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of astroglial fibrils surrounding these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are reduced in the aged rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These age-related differences emphasize the importance of using appropriately aged animals in experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
