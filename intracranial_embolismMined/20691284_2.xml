<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The study was performed to analyze the neuropsychological outcome and to detect new embolic ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> after therapeutic left atrial catheter ablation of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 23 patients with recurrent AF who underwent elective circumferential pulmonary vein isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the neuropsychological outcome 3 months after intervention in contrast to the results of non-AF controls (n = 23) without ablation and in covariance of baseline performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) was performed in 21 AF patients at baseline, 2-4 days, and 3 months after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 3/21 patients (14.3%), new ischemic lesions were detected on DWI shortly after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient, a territorial middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> occurred with severe clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other two patients represented clinically silent small lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the control group and in covariance of baseline performance, the ablation group showed worse neuropsychological outcome in verbal memory (one of five cognitive domains) with an effect size of d = 0.93[t (.05; 42) = -3.53; P &lt; .001; false discovery rate (FDR)(crit) â‰¤ .01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adverse neuropsychological changes after left atrial catheter ablation are verifiable in verbal memory and, conjoined with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> on DWI, might represent cerebral side effects of this procedure </plain></SENT>
