<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE) and beta-fibrinogen G/A-455 polymorphisms and cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) was examined in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared 227 patients with the subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (large-vessel disease, lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e>, or undetermined pathomechanisms) with 225 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of apoE isoforms (E2, E3, and E4) and the beta-fibrinogen G/A-455 genotype was determined in these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No differences in apoE polymorphisms or allele frequencies between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> patients and control subjects were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, analysis of apoE genotypes as a function of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype revealed that the apoE4 allele was significantly more common in those patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factor that distinguished patients with the E4 allele from those with other apoE genotypes was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated cholesterol</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association between the beta-fibrinogen G/A-455 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, homozygosity for the A allele was more common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> resulting from large-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that the apoE4 allele and the AA genotype of the beta-fibrinogen G/A-455 polymorphism occur significantly more frequently in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> resulting from stenosis of large, brain-supplying vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such genetic analyses may further our understanding of the etiology of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
