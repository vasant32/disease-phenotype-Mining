<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the case of a 15-year-old female on our paediatric rehabilitation service who, in a motor vehicle accident, suffered a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) which was followed by multiple thromboembolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Full work-up resulted in the diagnosis of Noonan's syndrome and the demonstration of significant posterior circulation congenital anomalies </plain></SENT>
