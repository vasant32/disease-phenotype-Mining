<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> of the atrial septum (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e>) are uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have been considered to be related to embolic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are usually associated with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac anomalies</z:hpo>, especially persistence of the formen ovale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied six patients diagnosed during a period of 24 months as having ischemic ictus and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were investigated for vascular risk factors and possible causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> by means of ECG, transthoracic and transoesophagic echography (ETE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with the clinical characteristics of embolism were anticoagulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients were men with an average age of 47.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three had the clinical features of established ictus, one of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e> and two of AIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The TSA study showed pathology of the carotid arteries to be present in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cases the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> was identified on ETE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the atria in any case, and in two there was left-right communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In four patients the condition was considered to have a cardio-embolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patient has had further episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: It seems there is a certain risk of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous presence of alterations in cardiac rhythm together with other structural cardiac pathology seems to have a synergic effect on this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Paradoxical embolism</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and intra-aneurysmal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> appear to be the mechanisms involved in the appearance of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The best therapeutic approach is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>New studies are therefore necessary to establish whether or not it is necessary to anticoagulate these patients </plain></SENT>
