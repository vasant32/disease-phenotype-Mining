<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the widespread application of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection is still limited in clinical practice because current transcranial Doppler systems have not the required sensitivity and specificity to analyze microembolic signals, particularly to distinguish between gaseous, or solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain emboli</z:e> and artefacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we proposed to investigate the potential of a new approach for the analysis of microembolic signals via the so-called matching pursuit, which is closely related to wavelet transform and is not subject to the same limitations as the fast Fourier transform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary results clearly indicate that matching pursuit is well suited to this task </plain></SENT>
