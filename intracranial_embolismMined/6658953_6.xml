<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this sample, survival rates showed no significant difference between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, however, clearly influenced survival changes; the expected mean survival was 6 years at 40 and 2 at age 80; average loss of life was 14 years for the whole sample, meaning a vital prognosis two to three times worse than that of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least 86% of the sample presented one or more of five etiological antecedents to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 87% of those, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHD</z:e> and/or PVD were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> significantly lowered life expectancy and so did PVD; their influence is felt from the earliest stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, the next most common factor, has a late influence, starting about the fifth year after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MI and AF were present in relatively fewer patients, but they contributed towards a considerable decrease in life expectancy, evident from the first stages, the more drastic reduction being observed in the AF group </plain></SENT>
