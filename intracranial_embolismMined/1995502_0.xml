<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent complete physical and neurological examinations, blood tests including coagulogram and two-dimensional echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group comprised 117 patients without cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the study group, 4 patients (11.1%) had MVP compared with 10 (8.5%) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these four, only one male did not have any risk factor for thromboembolic event; among the other three the risk factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that our results are in accordance with most of the literature that MVP is not a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> except in Greek and Italian populations, which are ethnically more homogeneous than other Western societies studied </plain></SENT>
