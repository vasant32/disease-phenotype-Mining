<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an abnormal expression of 14-3-3 proteins, a novel type of molecular chaperones, occurs in human gray and white matter ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prepared formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 33 autopsied brains, consisting of 7 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, 4 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, 5 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, 8 cases with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e>, and 9 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deparaffinized sections from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were immunostained with anti-14-3-3 antibodies using the avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-peroxidase complex method, and some sections were also double-immunostained for 14-3-3 and glial markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control brains, 14-3-3 immunoreactivity was mainly localized to the neuronal somata and processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strongly 14-3-3-immunopositive astrocytes were distributed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions and were particularly abundant in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intensely 14-3-3-immunolabeled astrocytes were also observed in the ischemic white matter lesions, and in the severely affected white matter lesions from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger disease</z:e>, dense 14-3-3 immunoreactivity was found in clasmatodendritic astroglia as well as in reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 14-3-3 proteins may be induced mainly in astrocytes from human cerebrovascular ischemic lesions, and that the upregulated expression of 14-3-3 proteins in astrocytes may be involved in the formation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
