<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Perioperative factors affecting the outcomes of postoperative brain function in patients with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From December 1977 to September 1994, 745 patients with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> underwent 846 operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age at surgery was 57.1 +/- 14.2 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four hundred seventy-four patients had true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and 372 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred forty-four patients underwent repair in the ascending aorta, 189 arch repair, 242 repair in the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>79 replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta, and 92 extra-anatomical bypass or thrombo-exclusion of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conventional cardiopulmonary bypass was used in 297 patients, partial cardiopulmonary bypass through femoral access in 167, selective cerebral perfusion in 253, deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> and retrograde cerebral perfusion in 50, temporary shunt in 29, and no circulatory support was applied in 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative cerebral complications were divided into permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The early mortality rate was 15.5% (131 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incremental risk factors for hospital mortality were non-preexisting cardiac lesions, ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, postoperative cerebral complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, low output syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral complications occurred in 81 patients (9.6%), involving 47 permanent and 34 transient sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The early mortality rate in patients with postoperative brain damage was 42.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The etiologies of the brain damage diagnosed by computed tomography were embolism in 41 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> in 16 and unknown in 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Incremental risk factors for postoperative cerebral complications were: operation early in the series advanced age at surgery, preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, aortic arch lesions, atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, aortic arch procedures and clamping of the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although there was an increased incidence of advanced age and complex lesions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, an improvement in surgical results has recently been achieved using advanced diagnostic and surgical techniques </plain></SENT>
