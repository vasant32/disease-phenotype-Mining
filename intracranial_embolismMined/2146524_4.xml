<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was undetermined in 12 patients (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 35 patients, we identified 39 potential mechanisms: large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (19 patients, 40%), cardioembolism (15 patients, 32%), and small-vessel occlusive disease (5 patients, 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 11 patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 9 (82%) had greater than 90% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion; of 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined mechanism, 10 (83%) had previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, of which 8 were also of undetermined mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disability after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was moderate or severe in 27 patients (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients taking aspirin has a variety of etiologies and frequently causes moderate or severe disability; (2) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> failing aspirin often have high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion; (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined mechanism may recur more frequently than other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes in patients taking aspirin </plain></SENT>
