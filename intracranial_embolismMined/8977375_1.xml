<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new rat model for multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> has recently been reported (Tani et al., 1994; 1995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural changes in the cerebral neocortex in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase were investigated in order to characterize the early pathological events in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A bolus injection of alkaline phenytoin solution (pH 10.8) into one internal carotid artery in the rat caused severe endothelial injury accompanied by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the cerebral vasculature within 5 minutes, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> of the ipsilateral hemisphere within an hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral water content was measured by the simple dry-wet method, and cerebral surface area and the surface area and volume of the ischaemic zone were measured using computer-aided image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Good correlations were demonstrated between cerebral water content and cerebral surface area, and between the surface area and volume of the ischaemic zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report here that quantitative evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral damage induced by phenytoin solution is possible with high reliability using simple image analysis </plain></SENT>
