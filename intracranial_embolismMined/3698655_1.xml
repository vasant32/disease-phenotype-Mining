<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients who were undergoing an 8-week course of physical rehabilitation, which started on average 30 days after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, were entered into a controlled double-blind, randomized study of 600 mg naftidrofuryl daily against identical placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were measured before, and at 4 and 8 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of treatment: neurological examinations by a weighted-assessment system, walking ability, and independence in activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the degree of cerebral lesion and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were evaluated by CT scan and the size of the EEG deformations were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the first 4 weeks of rehabilitation, the placebo patients showed a significant improvement in the neurological symptoms which did not continue during the second period of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the naftidrofuryl patients showed a continuous improvement in the neurological impairment during the whole period of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, at the end of treatment, there was a statistical difference between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An explorative analysis of the most frequent symptoms showed a significant improvement in the naftidrofuryl group in independence in activities of daily living, walking, bladder control and sensory syndrome, whilst the changes in the placebo group were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another significant change under treatment with naftidrofuryl was found in EEG evaluation which, at the end of the treatment period, showed less moderate and severe pathological alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus the value of naftidrofuryl treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accidents</z:e> may be explained by an activation of cerebral metabolism in partially damaged regions of the brain, leading to an improvement in learning ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this way the recovery process that occurs during rehabilitation may be accelerated </plain></SENT>
