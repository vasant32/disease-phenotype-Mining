<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients ranged in age from 8 years to 64 years and consisted of 6 males and 11 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following results were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fresh and massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was confirmed in 13 of 17 patients and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 4 of 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these 13 patients, massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was found in basal ganglia, thalamus and hypothalamus of 9 patients, and in thalamus, cerebral peduncle and midbrain of 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rupture of the dilated muscular-type arteries was noted in the thalamus and basal ganglia in 2 of 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ruptured arteries with organization of the lumen were found in the old hemorrhagic foci in one of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overgrown and dilated arteries, branching off from the circle of Willis, were confirmed in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These arteries consisted of "perforating" arteries well developed as collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No ruture in these arteries of the subarachnoidal spaces was found in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In one of them, a small saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggest that in patients with occlusion of the circle of Willis intracerebral rupture of overgrown "perforating" arteries as collateral circulation may be the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to rupture of the arteries may be repeated </plain></SENT>
