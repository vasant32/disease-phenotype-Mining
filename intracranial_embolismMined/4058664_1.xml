<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When conventional CT (plain &amp; contrast enhancement) can not demonstrate the lesions, it was impossible to diagnose in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a new technique which enabled us to diagnose them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods; Seven cases of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, in which no abnormality was detected by repeated magnified serial angiography with subtraction technique and prolonged injection technique, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each case, conventional CT (plain &amp; enhancement using 100 ml of 60% meglumine iothalamate) was performed first, which was immediately followed by the administration of 220 ml of 30% meglumine iothalamate for one hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT is taken at the end of the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It, we call, is prolonged high dose delayed contrast CT: PHDD-CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total dose of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> used in this technique was 59.22 gI (1.0 gI/kg body weight: BW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results; Contrast enhancement effect of PHDD-CT was much better than that of conventional CT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three cases, the lesions were more clearly delineated in PHDD-CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In four cases, only PHDD-CT could demonstrate the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No side effect was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Comments; Several techniques for better enhancement have been reported, however they used large volume of contrast medium such as 1.5 or 2.0 gI/kg BW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our technique can be performed with more security </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Based on our good results, we recommend to use this PHDD-CT technique for the diagnosis of angiographically occult vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
