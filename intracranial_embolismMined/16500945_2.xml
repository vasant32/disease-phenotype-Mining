<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To measure the frequency of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) by using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound and to assess their association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, neuropsychological dysfunction, and biochemical, sonographic and clinical variables in an unselected group of patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 1-h TCD recording from the middle cerebral artery was carried out in 55 patients with SLE having a mean age of 46 (SD 13) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI of the brain, carotid artery ultrasonography with intima-media thickness and atherosclerotic plaque assessments were carried out in addition to a broad biochemical and clinical assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 55 patients, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 5 (9%) and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found in 9 (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and considerably more neuropsychological deficits were found in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-positive patients compared with the negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were not associated with other clinical, sonographic and biochemical factors believed to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral embolism</z:e> may be one of the important mechanisms responsible for the high prevalence of cerebrovascular events and the neuropsychological deficits observed in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-positive patients was small, the lack of a significant association between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and other known risk factors for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> suggests a complex pathogenesis for the embolisation in these patients </plain></SENT>
