<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used transesophageal echography (TEE) to evaluate potential source of emboli in aortic arch and heart, and duplex in carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A atherosclerotic lesion of aortic arch was defined as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (0), mild plaque (1), moderate plaque (2) and protruding plaque or mobile plaque (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>75 of 100 patients were found to have atherosclerotic lesion in aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>16 of 75 patients over degree 2 exhibited no pathologic finding of heart or carotid and 4 of 16 patients were classified as degree 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathologic findings of heart and carotid were significantly correlated with aortic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, CAD were also significantly correlated with aortic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic plaque might be responsible for not only some unexplained embolic events, but also for some of the embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patient who have carotid artery or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, CAD might be important risk factors in the development of atherosclerotic lesion in the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
