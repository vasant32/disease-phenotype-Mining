<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>127 patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) were analyzed for the relationship between the amount of blood clots as detected by initial computed tomography (CT) up to 48 hours after SAH and changes of blood flow velocities as measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were operated on within 72 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who presented with remarkable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> or with pathological intracranial pressure (ICP) due to mass effects of a haematoma, and who were in a poor neurological condition classified according to Hunt-Hess as grade V were excluded from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial TCD examination of the middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and anterior cerebral arteries (ACA) started within 48 hours after SAH and were performed daily up to three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant correlation between blood load designated according to Fisher's grading as group CT I-CT IV and mean flow velocities (MFV) was found in groups CT I, II, and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High values of MFV in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> examinations were noted in patients with severe SAH (group CT III)--161 cm/s, and low values in patients without SAH (group CT I)--119 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with haematocephalus and/or haematoma without a mass effect (group CT IV) had lower blood flow velocities than patients with severe SAH (group CT III) but values were higher than in patients without SAH (group CT I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of days for which MFV in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was &gt; 120 cm/s and was statistically (p &lt; 0.05) correlated with the amount of blood clots as observed in the respective CT (in group CT I, II, and III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MFV values in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) were lower than those obtained in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences were noted between groups CT I and CT III (first and third week) and between groups CT I and CT IV (third week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If the SAH was extensive in the CT scan, pathological values of MFV &gt; 90 cm/s were observed in ACA, and this was more pronounced in group CT III than in group CT IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocities obtained via TCD were registered to compare side-to-side differences and particularly high differences were observed in patients with severe SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the amount of blood clots in the initial computed tomography after SAH is significantly correlated with cerebral blood flow velocity measurements by TCD </plain></SENT>
