<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study the feasibility and safety of carotid angioplasty and stenting using a new cerebral protection device that temporarily occludes the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight high-risk patients (39 men, mean age 69.1 +/- 8 years, range 54 to 86) with 53 ICA stenoses underwent percutaneous angioplasty and stenting via the femoral approach under cerebral protection afforded by a 0.014-inch GuardWire balloon occlusion device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean stenosis was 82.1% +/- 9.65% (range 70 to 96) and mean lesion length was 16.0 +/- 7.5 mm (range 6 to 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three (62%) lesions were calcified, and 38 (72%) were ulcerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two (60%) of the lesions were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the occlusion balloon inflated in the distal ICA, the lesion was dilated and stented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area was cleaned by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and flushed via an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> catheter advanced over the wire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected from the external carotid artery (ECA) and analyzed to measure the size and number of particles collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and neurological examinations were performed the day after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immediate technical success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the implantation of 38 Palmaz stents, 8 Expander stents, and 11 Wallstents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Carotid occlusion was well tolerated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but 1 who had multiple, severe carotid lesions and poor collateralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean cerebral flow occlusion time was 346 +/- 153 seconds during predilation and 303 +/- 143 seconds during stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Total mean flow occlusion time was 542 +/- 243 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One immediate neurological complication (transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amaurosis</z:e>) occurred in a patient who had an anastomosis between the external carotid (EC) and ICA territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Debris was removed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a mean 0.8-mm diameter catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral protection with the GuardWire device is easy, safe, and effective in protecting the brain from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are warranted </plain></SENT>
