<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with a higher risk of neurological events for both the transfemoral and transapical approach than surgical valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging has revealed more new, albeit clinically silent lesions from procedural embolization, yet the main source and predominant procedural step of emboli remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-three patients underwent transfemoral (Medtronic CoreValve [MCV(TF)], n=32; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> Sapien [ES(TF)], n=26) and transapical (ES(TA): n=25) TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial transcranial Doppler examinations before, during, and 3 months after TAVI were used to identify high-intensity transient signals (HITS) as a surrogate for microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Procedural HITS were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, predominantly during manipulation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006116'>calcified aortic valve</z:mp> while stent valves were being positioned and implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The balloon-expandable ES prosthesis caused significantly more HITS (mean [95% CI]) during positioning (ES(TF), 259.9 [184.8-334.9]; ES(TA), 206.1[162.5-249.7]; MCV(TF), 78.5 [25.3-131.6]; P&lt;0.001) and the self-expandable MCV prosthesis during implantation (MCV(TF), 397.1 [302.1-492.2]; ES(TF), 88.2 [70.2-106.3]; ES(TA), 110.7 [82.0-139.3]; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were no significant differences between transfemoral and transapical TAVI or between the MCV and ES prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No HITS were detected at baseline or 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was 1 major procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and 1 minor procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with full recovery at 3-month follow-up in the MCV group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Procedural HITS were detected by transcranial Doppler in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although no difference was observed between the transfemoral and the transapical approach with the balloon-expandable ES stent valve, transfemoral TAVI with the self-expandable MCV prosthesis resulted in the greatest number of HITS, predominantly during implantation </plain></SENT>
