<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Distal filter protection allows for continuous cerebral perfusion during carotid artery stenting (CAS), although a higher risk of debris migrating into the cerebral arteries compared with other protection systems has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To improve the extent of debris capture, we used routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of blood located proximal to the filter in the internal carotid artery blood column before retrieval of the filter device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 71 CAS procedures with distal filter protection, routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> was performed in 41 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The size and number of debris particles in each aspirated blood sample were measured under a stereoscopic microscope in 30 consecutive procedures with routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of periprocedural neurological events was compared between 41 procedures with routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and the other 30 without routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the aspirated blood, debris particles ≥ 500 μm and ≥ 1000 μm in the longest diameter were observed in 30 (100%) and 28 (93.3%) procedures, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of particles ≥ 1000 μm was significantly larger in the second through fourth blood aspirates vs the first aspirate (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of periprocedural neurological events was significantly less frequent in the routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> group (0 of 41 procedures) than in the conventional method group (7 of 30 procedures) (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> during CAS with distal filter protection possibly reduced periprocedural neurological events by increasing the proportion of debris captured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To improve the capture of debris particles, at least 4 repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspirations</z:hpo> are advisable during each CAS procedure </plain></SENT>
