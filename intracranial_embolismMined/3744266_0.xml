<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 39 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e> and 151 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, 60 of which showed mild and 91 severe neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>38 patients died during the period of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While sex of the patients as well as vascular risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, cigarette smoking) did not influence the clinical course of the disease, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e> in general were younger (about 5 years) than those with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prognosis of cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> depended to a great degree on the underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group of valvular diseases the course of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in mitral lesions was worse than in aortal valve disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was worst in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, both in view of neurological deficit and of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mostly, the cardiogenic emboli lead to infarctions of the middle cerebral artery territory (78 per cent) with a predilection for the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the neuroradiological findings, the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> or circulatory disturbance in angiography as well as the finding of an ischemic lesion in computed axial tomography (CAT) was correlated with a severe course of the embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>While 7 patients with hemorrhagic infarction in CAT-Scan showed no differences in the clinical course, the 14 patients with pathological cerebral spinal fluid findings in embolism had an unfavourable prognosis </plain></SENT>
