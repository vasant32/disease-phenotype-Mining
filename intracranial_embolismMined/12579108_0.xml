<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In animals the Cardeon Cobra catheter (Cardeon Corp, Cupertino, Calif) allows independent control of aortic arch and descending aortic temperatures and profoundly reduces cerebral embolization during bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This investigation describes the first clinical use of the device during adult cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to confirm that the Cobra catheter delivers adequate cerebral and systemic perfusion while providing simultaneous cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and systemic normothermia during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective multicenter study the Cobra aortic catheter was placed in 20 adults undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arch and corporeal temperatures, bypass flows, and arterial blood pressures were recorded intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Jugular bulb and mixed venous oxygen saturation was used to assess the adequacy of cerebral and systemic perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surgeons at 3 institutions placed the Cobra catheter in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 13), valve (n = 3), and combined valve-bypass (n = 4) operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean total bypass flows of 2.1 +/- 0.2 L x min(-1) x m(-2) maintained mean arterial pressures in arch and descending aortic circulations of greater than 55 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mean differential of 4.3 degrees C between arch and descending aortic temperatures was established before crossclamp application, and a mean maximum temperature differential of 7 degrees C was established during bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 2.4 degrees C temperature differential was maintained at crossclamp removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral and systemic venous oxygen saturation remained greater than 65% during bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Cobra device met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> expectations for an arterial cannula with adequate perfusion to the arch and corporeal circulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dual perfusion with the Cobra catheter allows for independent temperature control during cardiopulmonary bypass with simultaneous cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and systemic normothermia </plain></SENT>
