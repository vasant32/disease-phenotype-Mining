<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This step reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, reduces operative blood loss, and makes for a less hazardous dissection with the goal of reducing morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of a recently described technique of interrupting vascular supply via covered stent placement in the external carotid artery is further described in a series of three recent cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique may be useful for large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a primary blood supply from the external carotid since it avoids the intracranial embolic risk of coils used for this purpose </plain></SENT>
