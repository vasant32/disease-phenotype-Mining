<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animal studies intravascular Doppler has been used in the cerebrovascular system, and this appears to be an important field of application for this new technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used intravascular haemodynamic monitoring by the Doppler guide wire during neuroendovascular procedures in patients with different cerebrovascular diseases and evaluated the clinical feasibility of the method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found it a safe technique which complements morphological angiographic information with valuable functional data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further studies may be expected to demonstrate the relation of flow parameters to clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
