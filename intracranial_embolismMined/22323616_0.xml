<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to establish an accurate prognosis as soon as possible after the insult to guide management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical assessment is not reliable and ancillary investigations, particularly imaging and EEG, are needed to understand the severity of brain injury and the likely outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study of 39 patients on an intensive therapy unit (ITU) with HIBI who were referred for MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were seen consecutively &gt;57 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HIBI was due to a variety of insults causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, hypoperfusion or isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The outcome was poor, 29 patients died, 7 were left severely disabled and only 3 made a good recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Characteristic imaging changes were seen on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These included extensive changes in the cortex and the deep grey matter present on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging within 6 days of the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In other patients, different patterns of involvement of the cortex and basal ganglia occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the outcome or imaging appearances according to aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A poor prognosis was consistently associated with a non- or poorly responsive EEG rhythm and the presence of periodic generalized phenomena with a very low-voltage background activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study of patients with HIBI, MRI and EEG provided valuable information concerning prognosis </plain></SENT>
