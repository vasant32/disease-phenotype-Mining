<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our clinic repeat angiograms have shown non-filling of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in three patients during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48669">tranexamic acid</z:chebi> (AMCA) two, three, and four weeks respectively after primary bleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initially, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients had severe radiological vasospasm associated with neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiograms have demonstrated partial reappearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> after one month in one patient and complete disappearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the other two patients after 9 and 22 months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two cases occlusion of cerebral arteries occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With regard to the higher risk of severe vasospasm and occlusion of cerebral arteries in our opinion it should not be a therapeutic goal to try to achieve a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48675">antifibrinolytic drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reason for spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during treatment with AMCA may be a local inhibition of plasminogen activators in and around the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may also be related to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> property of the drug, with vasospasm and a subsequent flow-reduction inside the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or a possible interaction with other drugs and substances </plain></SENT>
