<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In an observational study of 312 older persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, long-term aspirin 325 mg daily was administered to 187 persons, and oral <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, in a dose adjusted to maintain the international normalized ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0, was administered to 115 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of new TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was analyzed in persons treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> versus aspirin at 36 +/- 17 months (1 to 99 months) follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A large, long-term healthcare facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: The patients included 208 women and 104 men, mean age 84 +/- 7 years (range 62 to 101 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Four of 125 persons (3%) on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> stopped taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> compared with four of 187 persons (2%) on aspirin who stopped taking aspirin because of adverse effects (P not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In persons with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the incidence of new TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 40% (27 of 67) in persons treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> versus 81% (56 of 69) in persons treated with aspirin (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In persons with no prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the incidence of new TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 22% (13 of 58) in persons treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> versus 56% (66 of 118) in persons treated with aspirin (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of new TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects was 32% (40 of 125) in persons treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> versus 65% (122 of 187) in persons treated with aspirin (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis showed that persons taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> had a 76% less chance of developing a new TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than those taking aspirin after controlling the confounding effects of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In an observational study of older persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, persons treated with oral <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> to maintain an INR between 2.0 and 3.0 had a significantly lower incidence of new TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than persons treated with oral aspirin 325 mg daily </plain></SENT>
