<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The PercuSurge system is a distal balloon embolic protection device used for carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective study on the prognosis and clinical effects of spasms induced by the PercuSurge GuardWire system (PercuSurge-induced spasm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed CAS in 118 carotid stenoses using the PercuSurge system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 118 procedures, 31 (26.3%) of the patients experienced PercuSurge-induced spasm, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent postoperative follow-up studies by cerebral angiography and antiplatelet treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On follow-up angiograms obtained a mean of 5.2 months (range 3-10 months) after CAS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 31 PercuSurge-induced spasms had disappeared, and no delayed stenosis was found at the sites where the spasms had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No ischemic events due to the spasms occurred during a mean follow-up of 13 months (range 3-32 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the hands of physicians experienced in endovascular surgery, CAS using the PercuSurge system is a safe method with which to treat patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that PercuSurge-induced spasms had no morphological or clinical adverse effects </plain></SENT>
