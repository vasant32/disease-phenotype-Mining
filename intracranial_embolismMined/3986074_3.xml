<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No change in EEG or clinical status was seen with occlusion of the carotid artery, but generalized encephalopathic changes were seen after a small dose of narcotic given before carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bihemispheric changes in EEG and neurological status occurred upon release of carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates three important points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, EEG changes can be seen with sedative or <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> agents in patients who have previously suffered brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, temporary neural dysfunction may be seen remote from the site of a localized injury to the brain--a phenomenon known as diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, this report reiterates the observation that the risk of injury to the brain during carotid endarterectomy is not limited to the period of possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> during occlusion of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
