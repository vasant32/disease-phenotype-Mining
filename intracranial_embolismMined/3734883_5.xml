<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of this disease, 188 patients admitted within 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion were followed for 2 months, and data relating to mortality and changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004372'>disturbances of consciousness</z:hpo> and motor function were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the prognosis for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion cases is poor, and about 80% of these patients are unable to return to their previous lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of consciousness in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage is a good index for estimating the patients' quality and time of survival, and motor function in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage is a good indicator of functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, when evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, rapid improvement in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage before and after treatment should be carefully noted </plain></SENT>
