<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> within cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may have an influence on tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since old animals with an impaired immune response have decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> after experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, we postulated that female animals with an increased immune response will have an <z:mp ids='MP_0001846'>increased inflammatory response</z:mp> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Embolic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were produced by photochemical irradiation of the right carotid artery in 12 female Fischer rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> within 4-day-old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was quantitated by histology with the use of computer-assisted image analysis and compared with that in 12 male rats from a previous series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had the most pronounced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Female rats had an <z:mp ids='MP_0001846'>increased inflammatory response</z:mp> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> severity, which was statistically significant in severe cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> even after adjustment for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in males were significantly larger than those in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gender influences the outcome of embolic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after photochemical damage to the carotid artery, both in terms of the magnitude of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There are numerous gender-related differences in neurochemicals, cytokine production, and drug metabolism that may influence tissue damage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and responsiveness to therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The preponderance of male animals in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research may produce results not applicable to female <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of female animals will be required to provide adequate models for the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in women </plain></SENT>
