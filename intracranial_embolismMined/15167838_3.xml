<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a descriptive study of 23 women (35 pregnancies) with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Charts were reviewed from 1990 through 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed for the antenatal treatment strategies, recurrence risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 23 study patients with 35 subsequent pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associated risk factors of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (5 women), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> (3 women), maternal cardiac malformations (3 women), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (3 women), oral contraceptive use (2 women), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002408'>cerebral arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (2 women), head trauma (1 woman), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (1 woman), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (1 woman), and idiopathic reason (2 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four women with 9 subsequent pregnancies had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that was associated with a previous pregnancy or postpartum incident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of these 9 pregnancies received anticoagulation (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, 1 pregnancy; <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus aspirin, 1 pregnancy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen women with 26 subsequent pregnancies had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> before pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine of these 26 pregnancies received anticoagulation (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, 5 pregnancies; aspirin, 3 pregnancies; <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus aspirin, 1 pregnancy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining pregnancies did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were 21 term deliveries, 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm deliveries</z:hpo>, 5 miscarriages, and 1 fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three of 34 pregnancies (9%) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>small for gestational age infants</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no recurrent thrombotic episodes during pregnancy or after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Maternal complications included admission to the intensive care unit for uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Women with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have a low risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This information is useful for the prepregnancy counseling of such individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The need for prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cannot be answered by this study </plain></SENT>
