<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to assess clinical outcomes and closure status after the transcatheter closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred thirty-seven consecutive patients (mean age 53 +/- 15 years; 48% men) who underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> closure for the prevention of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Closure status was monitored at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after the index procedure by power M-mode transcranial Doppler and was defined by the number of embolic tracks detected after the release of a sustained, calibrated Valsalva maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 568 +/- 364 days, the cumulative event rate for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 8) was 3.4%, for an estimated event-free survival of 0.94 (SE 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the estimated probability of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for patients grouped by age (&lt; or =55 years 1.4% vs &gt;55 years 6.6%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (3.0%), 1 secondary to and 6 unrelated to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and 3 surgical explantations (1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival, defined as freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or explantation, was 0.92 (SE 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of RLS was significantly less at late follow-up compared with baseline (grade 4.6 +/- 0.7 vs 1.8 +/- 1.6, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete closure or minimal residual RLS (grade 0 to II) was achieved in 66% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Device type (CardioSEAL or Amplatzer) did not affect the risk for adverse events or the presence of large residual RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, transcatheter <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> closure is associated with a low recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
