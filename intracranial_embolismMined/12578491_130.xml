<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between alcohol consumption and relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: Studies published in English-language journals were retrieved by searching MEDLINE (1966-April 2002) using Medical Subject Headings alcohol drinking, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular disorders, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial embolism</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the key word <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; Dissertation Abstracts Online using the keywords <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and alcohol; and bibliographies of retrieved articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: From 122 relevant retrieved reports, 35 observational studies (cohort or case control) in which total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, or hemorrhagic (intracerebral or total) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was an end point; the relative risk or relative odds and their variance (or data to calculate them) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with alcohol consumption were reported; alcohol consumption was quantified; and abstainers served as the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: Information on study design, participant characteristics, level of alcohol consumption, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome, control for potential confounding factors, and risk estimates was abstracted independently by 3 investigators using a standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DATA SYNTHESIS: A random-effects model and meta-regression analysis were used to pool data from individual studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with abstainers, consumption of more than 60 g of alcohol per day was associated with an increased relative risk of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.93); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.34-2.15); and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 2.18 (95% CI, 1.48-3.20), while consumption of less than 12 g/d was associated with a reduced relative risk of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 0.83 (95%, CI, 0.75-0.91) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67-0.96), and consumption of 12 to 24 g/d was associated with a reduced relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 0.72 (95%, CI, 0.57-0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The meta-regression analysis revealed a significant nonlinear relationship between alcohol consumption and total and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and a linear relationship between alcohol consumption and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that heavy alcohol consumption increases the relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> while light or moderate alcohol consumption may be protective against total and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
