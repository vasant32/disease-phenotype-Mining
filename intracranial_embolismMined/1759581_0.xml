<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The establishment of an animal model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial nerve paralysis</z:hpo> is assuming increasing importance in clinical medicine and also in basic facial nerve research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported an animal model for ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial nerve paralysis</z:hpo> using selective vascular embolization through the internal maxillary and posterior auricular arteries in cats using Avitene which contains bovine microfibril collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we determined the exact site of the lesion in established facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A descending signal produced by direct stimulation to the contralateral motor cortex was able to elicit firing of the motor nucleus of the facial nerve, the extra-temporal portion of the peripheral nerve, and the orbicularis oris muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After achieving complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial nerve paralysis</z:hpo>, this descending signal was completely abolished within the temporal bone area, whereas peripheral facial nerve stimulation elicited a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> evoked electromyogram of the orbicularis oris muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that the site of the lesion of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial nerve paralysis</z:hpo> produced by embolization in an animal model is within the temporal portion of the seventh nerve, and this animal model may lead to the advancement of future facial nerve research which cannot be conducted in humans </plain></SENT>
