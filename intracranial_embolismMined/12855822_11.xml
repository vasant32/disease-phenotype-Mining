<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine the importance of emboli not trapped by carotid angioplasty filtration devices, we examined fragments &lt;100 microm released with ex vivo angioplasty and asked if fragment composition and size correlated with brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human carotid plaques (21) were excised en bloc, and ex vivo carotid angioplasty was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight plaques were selected as either highly calcified (4) or highly fibrotic (4) by high-resolution MRI (200 microm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fragments were counted by a Coulter counter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before injection into male Sprague-Dawley rats, fragments from calcified and fibrotic plaques were sized with 60-, 100-, and 200-microm filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> and infarction were assessed by MRI scans (7-T small-bore magnet) and by immunohistologic staining for HSP70 and NueN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 animals injected with 100- to 200-microm calcified fragments had infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One was lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After injection of 60- to 100-microm calcified fragments, 7 of 12 animals had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e>, whereas only 1 of 11 had infarctions with fibrous fragments (P&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HSP70 staining showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was more common and more extensive than infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was found in 10 of 12 animals after injection of calcified fragments and in 9 of 11 after injection of fibrous fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean number of 60- to 100-microm fragments released was 375+/-510; the mean number of 20- to 60-microm fragments was 34 196 (range, 2230 to 186 927) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hundreds of thousands of microemboli can be shed during carotid angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fragments from calcified plaques cause greater levels of infarction than fragments from fibrous plaques, although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is common with both fragment types </plain></SENT>
