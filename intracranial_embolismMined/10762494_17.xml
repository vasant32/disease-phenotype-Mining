<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) could identify potentially clinically relevant findings in patients presenting more than 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> when compared with conventional MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MRI with both conventional (T2 and proton density images) and echoplanar imaging (DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient maps) was performed 6 to 48 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (mean, 27 hours) in 40 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesions were identified first on conventional images, then on DWI, by a neuroradiologist who was provided with the suspected lesion location, based on a neurologist's examination before imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities were rated as potentially clinically relevant if they were detected only on DWI and 1) confirmed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic lesion to be in a different vascular territory than suspected clinically, 2) revealed multiple lesions in different vascular territories suggestive of a proximal source of embolism, or 3) clarified that a lesion, thought to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> on conventional imaging, was not <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The initial clinical impression of lesion localization was incorrect in 12 patients (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant findings were detected by DWI alone in 19 patients (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DWI demonstrated the symptomatic lesion in a different vascular territory than suspected clinically or by conventional MRI in 7 patients (18%) and showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesions in multiple vascular distributions in 5 patients (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients (20%), DWI clarified that lesions thought to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> on conventional MRI were actually old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients imaged 6 to 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, DWI frequently provided potentially clinically relevant findings that were not apparent on conventional MRI </plain></SENT>
