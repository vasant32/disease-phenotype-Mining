<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As surgical intervention became necessary we were able to investigate the morphological changes by histology and immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The almost exclusive venous manifestation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> most probably initiated by elevated amounts of platelets suggests altered blood flow conditions as the predominant factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical interventions in such conditions are rare and might only proceed in space-occupying lesions with clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with inhibitors of platelet aggregation under strict control of the patient is the therapy of choice </plain></SENT>
