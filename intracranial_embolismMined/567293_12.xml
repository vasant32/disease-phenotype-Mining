<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The common statement that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> cease when an artery becomes occluded must, therefore, be modified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of the 20 patients reported here developed symptoms weeks to years after the appropriate artery was known to be occluded, while 10 attacks occurred within 1 week after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolism through collateral circulation probably accounts for the delayed ischemic events in most of the patients, and hemodynamic factors in a few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stump of the occluded artery may be the site of atheromatous ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possibility of revascularization procedures for patients with occluded arteries makes pertinent these observations about potential embolic sources </plain></SENT>
