<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of two-hundred twenty-eight consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, 128 cases were performed transesophageal echocardiography to find cardiac lesions that could be embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three cases were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> demonstrated by contrast echocardiography under Valsalva maneuver </plain></SENT>
