<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study seeks to determine if the known risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can account for this increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this case-control study controls (neighborhood volunteers) were group-matched to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases by ethnicity in a ratio of approximately 2:1 for African-Americans and Latinos and 1:1 for whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extensive historical, clinical and laboratory data were collected on each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each ethnic group cases were somewhat older and less well-educated than the volunteer controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in each ethnic group were similar with regard to time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to hospital admission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, length of stay, discharge disposition and mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With minor exceptions the distributions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes within each ethnic group appeared similar to those previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subject recruitment for this case-control study was completed in the manner and time frame planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of risk factor information from this sample should provide valuable information regarding the relative risk associated with the major modifiable risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the minority groups studied </plain></SENT>
