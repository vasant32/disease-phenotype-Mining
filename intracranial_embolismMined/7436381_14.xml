<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study presents seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in a vascular distribution appropriate to their clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three patients, angiographic evidence of embolization was present distal to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> without apparent cardiac or extracranial arterial source for the emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most reasonable pathogenesis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in a patient with an associated saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> would be <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the aneurysmal sac with subsequent embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, subarachnoid blood can cause permanent focal intracranial narrowing, and this appeared to be a factor in at least one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results imply that patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> should have their intracranial arterial circulation visualized as part of the diagnostic evaluation </plain></SENT>
