<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the different intracranial vessels with respect to emboli detection can be of use in identifying the source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a patient with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on the right side, with evidence for high-degree ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> narrowing on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During transcranial Doppler monitoring 3 days later, we found frequent emboli-like signals in the power spectrum of the right <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> distal to the stenosis but not in any other intracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four days later, angiography and transcranial Doppler failed to show <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> narrowing, and transcranial Doppler monitoring of the right <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> showed no further emboli-like signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A stenosis of the right vertebral artery was regarded as the possible source of thromboembolic narrowing of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We assume that in our patient a thrombotic clot in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> was resolved autolytically through detachment of small emboli into the distal part of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We speculate that in the early course of autolysis a larger fragment of the clot had occluded one of the distal branches, thus leading to the small <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
