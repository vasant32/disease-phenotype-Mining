<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report our initial experience using a transcervical approach for carotid angioplasty/stenting (CAS) that employs internal carotid artery (ICA) flow reversal for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients (15 men; mean age 65 years, range 49-77) with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (mean 88%, 8 symptomatic) were treated with protected transcervical CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were considered at high risk for carotid endarterectomy; 8 were also considered high risk for transfemoral access (unfavorable aortic arch <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> or advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306762" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortoiliac occlusive disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was based on patient and anesthesiologist preferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The approach consisted of a 2-cm cutdown over the common carotid artery and placement of a 9-F sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ICA flow was reversed and shunted into the jugular vein during the carotid intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Access and carotid stenting were successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen procedures were performed under general and 4 under local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean flow reversal time was 34+/-4 minutes (25 minutes in the last 7 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients tolerated the procedure well and had no neurological events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four (23%) patients had significant oozing from the operative site; 2 developed small neck <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> that were treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were discharged on the first postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, changes in neurological status, or restenosis over a mean follow-up of 12 months (range 1-24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience demonstrates that a transcervical approach is a viable alternative for CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The procedure can be performed safely, with good initial clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The approach allows carotid flow reversal and emboli protection without introducing neuroprotection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The method appears best suited for patients at high risk for endarterectomy and transfemoral access </plain></SENT>
