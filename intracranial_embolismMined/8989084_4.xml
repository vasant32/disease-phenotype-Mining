<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Video-assisted endoscopic techniques had been applied in the surgical correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010775'>vascular ring</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been used only recently in the correction of reoperative mitral valve lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Video-assisted cardiac operations were performed on four patients who had received surgical interventions on their mitral valves and needed emergent reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Four patients (3 men and 1 woman) received emergency surgery from September to December 1995 for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of mechanical mitral prosthesis (2 patients) and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> with previously failed mitral valve repair (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six previous operations had been performed on these mitral valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient ages ranged from 26.7 to 68.1 years (mean, 47.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> occurred in two patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> occurred in one patient, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> was found in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mechanical ventilatory support was used in two patients before operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The operations were performed through right anterior minithoracotomy, guided by video-assisted endoscopic techniques with femoro-femoral extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The operative procedures were thrombectomy of mitral prosthesis in two patients, mitral valve repair in one patient, and mitral valve replacement in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The duration of extracorporeal circulation was 166 to 320 min (222 +/- 67 min) and the operation time was 4.6 to 6.8 h (6.1 +/- 1.0 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients recovered from the operations rapidly with uneventful postoperative courses except 1 patient who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> preoperatively and died 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our experience demonstrates that video-assisted cardiac surgery is technically feasible and could be performed in reoperation of the mitral valve </plain></SENT>
