<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of microemboli in SAH-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with aneurysmal SAH were monitored with transcranial Doppler (TCD) for the presence of embolic signals (ES) and vasospasm, and followed clinically for the development of cerebral ischemic symptoms, from the time the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was secured until day 14 posthemorrhage or discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microembolic signals were detected in 15/40 patients, appeared at a mean of 6.7 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and were often noted bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a close association between ES and cerebral ischemic symptoms (P= .003), and ES were commonly present in the distribution of the vessel with ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonographic vasospasm did not correlate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and there was no relationship between microembolic signals and vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, ES detected in over a third of SAH victims, were associated with the development of cerebral ischemic symptoms, and were not related to vasospasm, but rather appeared to be an independent risk factor for the development of ischemic symptoms in SAH </plain></SENT>
