<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Computerized axial transmission tomography and radionuclide imaging are complementary procedures, and the following recommendations are made as to their use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Where there is no real clinical suspicion of intracranial disease, either modality can be used for "rule out" screening; the choice can frequently be made on the basis of which modality is cheaper or more quickly available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It should be remembered that "quicker" is often "cheaper" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total cost is determined, not only by the cost of the procedure, but also the per diem costs incurred in waiting for that procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the more expensive modality may, in effect, be cheaper if delays are shorter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Screening of the elderly patient, particularly when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo> is of clinical concern, should be by the CT method because of its ability to visualize cerebrospinal fluid spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When clinical signs and symptoms point to intracranial abnormality, both modalities should be utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If either study done first is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, use of the other modality is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the first study is positive with pathognomonic findings for a specific disease, which totally explains the patient's neurologic problems, the second study need not be employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such examples might include the fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> demonstrated by CT imaging, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003857,C0007772" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">AV malformation</z:e> defined by dynamic-static radionuclide imaging, or multifocal metastatic lesions defined by either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, when the clinical picture is not totally and satisfactorily explained by the demonstrated disease, the other modality should also be employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Under many circumstances, neither study will be so reliable, specific, and free of false-negative or false-positive findings as to warrant ignoring the additional information potentially available from the other study </plain></SENT>
