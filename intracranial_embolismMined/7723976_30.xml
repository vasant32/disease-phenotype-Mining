<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and anti-CD18 (alpha-CD18) monoclonal antibody administered 5 minutes after embolization increased the quantity of clots required to produce neurologic damage, although the combination was no more effective than either substance alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither alpha-CD18 nor anti-ICAM-1 (alpha-ICAM-1) improved neurologic outcome at postischemic delays of 15 or 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the combination of alpha-ICAM-1 (15 minutes after embolization) and tPA (2 hours after embolization) significantly improved neurologic outcome even though neither substance was effective alone at these postembolization delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that prevention of leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> increases the postischemic duration at which thrombolytic therapy remains effective </plain></SENT>
