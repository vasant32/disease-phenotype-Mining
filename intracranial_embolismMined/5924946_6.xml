<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 1950, there has been a decline in mortality attributed to vascular lesions of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This decline has been more pronounced in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five-year average age-sex-specific rates (1960-64) showed an almost constant proportional increase with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest mortality rates tended to occur in the Eastern Provinces.From 1950 to 1964 there was a 21% decline in mortality due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and a concomitant 53% decline in mortality attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the same period there was a 24% increase in mortality attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and an 8% increase in mortality due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="cad|ASHD|ashd">arteriosclerotic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Areal correlations offered only inconsistent support for the hypothesis that these associated trends are due to common etiologic determinants.Evidence presently available does little to clarify to what extent these trends and differences can be attributed to coding, certification and diagnostic practices, and to what extent to changing and differing incidence and prognosis </plain></SENT>
