<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By the study of patients with embolic occlusion, we evaluated ischemic threshold of CBF for infarction to be 16 ml/100 ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The area of "penumbra" could be estimated in regions with CBF value just above this threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients with thrombotic occlusive lesion, we clarified that the efficiency of the collateral circulation was mainly related to the grade of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings must be helpful to develop better strategy for treatments of cerebral ischemic disease </plain></SENT>
