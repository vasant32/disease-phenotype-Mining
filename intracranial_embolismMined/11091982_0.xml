<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An alternative technique for identification of Doppler microemboli signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>), based on intensity measurements in the vessel and in an arbitrary sample volume was recently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the applicability of this approach as stand alone system, and compared it to the standard bigate method (TCD 8, version 8T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral TCD monitoring was performed in 11 patients with prosthetic heart valves and 15 patients during elective cardiac surgery, using three sample volumes (29 mm, 50 mm and 55 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data was saved on digital audio tapes and evaluated by two experienced observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only signals unanimously identified as <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> or artifacts by both observers were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 6189 MES and 11,241 artifacts were further analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of the bigate approach and the technique utilising the arbitrary sample volume were 90.7%, 91.3% and 88%, 91.9% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous monitoring over three sample volumes and combination of the two detection algorithms could potentially provide an adequate stand-alone system for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection </plain></SENT>
