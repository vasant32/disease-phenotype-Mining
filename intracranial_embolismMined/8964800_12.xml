<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The potential of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) to influence positively or negatively the outcome of mechanically induced focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that NO of vascular origin, whether synthesized from exogenously administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (L-Arg) or from NO donor compounds, is beneficial but that of neuronal origin is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the therapeutic potential of NO to ameliorate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the therapeutic effect of L-Arg administration in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) subjected to permanent photothrombotic occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery (dMCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral carotid artery was left unligated to enhance L-Arg delivery into the putative penumbral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local CBF (LCBF) was assessed at 30 min by the [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine technique (n = 9), while histological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and index of peripheral ischemic cell change were determined at 3 days (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats (n = 9) given 300 mg/kg L-Arg at 18 and 3 h before photothrombotic dMCA occlusion and at 5 min afterward displayed no significant differences in LCBF compared with animals (n = 8) injected with water (the carrier vehicle) and similarly irradiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were also similar, being 37.0 +/- 9.7 mm3 (SD) in the vehicle-treated and 49.1 +/- 17.2 mm3 (SD) in the L-Arg-treated groups (both n = 7), as were assessments of ischemic neuronal density in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, L-Arg administered intravenously in a dose of 300 mg/kg to nonischemic SHR (n = 5) increased cortical CBF by approximately 75% during a 70-min observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that thrombotic processes superimposed upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may facilitate tissue reactions that offset the potentially beneficial effect of L-Arg, and this caveat must be considered when proposing L-Arg for clinical treatment of focal thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
