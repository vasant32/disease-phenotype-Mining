<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients initially presented with an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>; three others presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT showed hyperdense (9) or isodense (1) lesion; the hyperdense portion was proven to be <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enhancement was seen in 6 cases and was absent in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed either avascular mass (7) or was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases, angiographic studies showed non-visualization of abnormal vessels on repeat study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a review of 200 cases of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, nine young patients had CT evidence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> but no angiographic or pathological evidence of abnormal vessels; and it was postulated that these represented cryptic vascular malformations or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical prognosis for both the angiographically occult (thrombosed) or cryptic cerebrovascular malformations was better than reported in previous studies </plain></SENT>
