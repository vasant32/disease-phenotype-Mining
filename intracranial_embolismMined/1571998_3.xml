<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our series of 80 cases, the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> was 3.75% (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cases occurred during the procedure itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cause of embolism was different in each case: cruoric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation occurred in 2 cases during or after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, and was attributable to inappropriate heparinization, and catheter and guidewire thrombogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cases <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> administration was delayed or given at a lower dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the third case, calcific embolism occurred several days after valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We think that the embolic calcified fragment was detached from the mitral leaflet at the time of or after balloon inflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these 3 cases, intraatrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> mobilization was not the mechanism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases, transesophageal echocardiography had been performed before <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and excluded the presence of an atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> the day before the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, together with mobilisation of left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, which can be adequately detected by transesophageal echocardiography, catheter-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> represent a significant cause of embolic complications and must be prevented by giving full-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during the total duration of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Calcific embolism may also occur, and may become more frequent if mitral valve balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> is proposed to a larger number of patients with valvular and subvalvular calcifications </plain></SENT>
