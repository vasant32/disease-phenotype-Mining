<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An early diagnosis and possible complications seem to be related to morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However there is no agreement in the second aspect: for some authors echocardiography only slightly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e>, but others consider it of great value in identifying high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient who suffers infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> by Staphylococcus aureus with significant neurological complications in its evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vegetation was disclosed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), whereas transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was unable to do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is why we underline the role of TEE in the diagnosis and description of vegetation features (size, mobility and implantation) which seem to be linked to the risk of cerebral complications </plain></SENT>
