<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) is important for the prevention of future events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to develop a scoring system that would identify those patients most likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records from an inpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> database and echocardiographic data were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients over the age of 18 who were admitted during a two-year period were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to identify variables associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses were used to develop a scoring system for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 953 patient charts were reviewed; 145 patients (15%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In univariate and multivariate analyses, variables that were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> included left atrial diameter, age, and diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A history of smoking showed an inverse association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 6-point scoring system based on these variables (with the acronym of LADS) was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A score of 4 or greater was associated with a sensitivity of 85.5% and a specificity of 53.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Approximately 47% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients would be excluded from further investigation using this score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We describe a system of scoring that identifies <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients with a greater chance of having <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An inverse relationship with smoking was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are required to determine the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of this scoring system in clinical practice and to investigate the inverse relationship between smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
