<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Retrograde <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of former feeding arteries should be considered as a distinct postoperative complication following surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>, the cerebral arteries undergo atherosclerotic changes with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, three cases in elderly patients who developed retrograde <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are reported, and the effect of the patient's age on this complication is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study group consisted of 158 patients who underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> resection and postoperative angiographic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients were 65 years of age or older (elderly group) at the time of operation, 108 were between 20 and 64 years of age (adult group), and 45 were less than 20 years of age (young group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of retrograde <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the elderly group was compared with that of the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that surgery in the elderly group was accompanied by a significantly higher incidence of retrograde <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (60%) than in the adult group (4%), or the young group (0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that this complication should be considered as a serious possibility following removal of an <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, especially in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
