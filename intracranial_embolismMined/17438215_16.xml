<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the types and mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a large population of HIV-infected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed records of consecutive HIV-infected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> admitted to a large metropolitan hospital between 1996 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mechanism was defined by consensus between two cerebrovascular neurologists using TOAST classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 82 patients were included, 77 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 5 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 42 years and 89% were African American </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> was documented in 91% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> diagnosis in 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean CD4 count was 113 cells/mm(3) and 85% had CD4 count &lt;200 cells/mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 61% of patients had received combination antiretroviral treatment (CART) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 12%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> in 18%, small vessel occlusion in 18%, other determined etiology in 23%, and undetermined in 29% (including 19% with incomplete evaluation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> was deemed responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 10 patients (13%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> in 7 (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Protein S deficiency</z:e> was noted in 10/22 (45%) and anticardiolipin antibodies in 9/31 (29%) tested patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When comparing patients with large or small vessel disease (atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) vs the rest of the population, there were no differences in exposure to CART or CD4 count, but patients with non-atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were younger (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recent cocaine exposure was less common among patients with atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> were fatal or severely disabling in 35% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms are variable in HIV-infected patients, with a relatively high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In our population of severely immunodepressed patients, exposure to combination antiretroviral treatment did not significantly influence the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
