<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical and vascular features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms, etiologies, and outcome of moderate to severe BA occlusive disease among 407 patients in the New England Medical Center Posterior Circulation Registry, the largest prospective series of consecutively collected patients with posterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 87 patients and identified 3 patient groups with distinct vascular, clinical, etiological, and prognostic characteristics: isolated BA disease (39 patients [44.8%]), BA involvement as part of widespread posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (36 patients [41.4%]), and embolism to the BA (12 patients [13.8%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors were common and often multiple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients (54 [62.1%]) had involvement of the midportion of the BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients (66%) initially had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, of whom 34 (58.6%) progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>Transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> were usually multiple, lasted for several months, and increased in frequency as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> approached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was present, the middle posterior intracranial territory was most often involved (66 patients [75.9%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome was much better than previously assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 2.3%, and 62 patients (almost 75%) had minor or no deficits at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Outcome was best among patients with widespread atherosclerotic disease and worst in 7; (58.3%, with major disability) of 12 patients with embolism to the BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Distal territory involvement, embolism, BA occlusion, decreased level of consciousness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo>, and abnormal pupils were significant predictors of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Inclusion of patients into 1 of the BA groups and early identification of predictive outcome factors guide diagnostic evaluation and treatment </plain></SENT>
