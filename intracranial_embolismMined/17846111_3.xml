<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and were studied within 24 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) was prospectively examined twice, within 24 h and at 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI was conducted twice, on admission and on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NIL were defined as the presence of hyperintense lesions undetected on initial DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 125 patients were consecutively enrolled from November 2004 to March 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCD detected <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in 49% within 24 h and in 29% at 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 27 patients with small vessel disease, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were found in 8 (30%) patients within 24 h and in 5 (19%) patients at 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in 20 patients with large vessel disease, 11 (55%) patients within 24 h and 7 (35%) at 48 h had <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up DWI detected NIL in 28 of 125 patients (22%) and NIL were significantly more frequent in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> positive patients (42%) than in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> negative patients at 48 h (15%; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> at 48 h (OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.5 to 10; p = 0.005), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.3 to 11; p = 0.013) and arterial lesions (OR 4.3; 95% CI 1.5 to 12; p = 0.007) represented independent factors for NIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> at 48 h, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and arterial lesions were associated with recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> on DWI </plain></SENT>
