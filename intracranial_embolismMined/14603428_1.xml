<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Women suffer an excess of complications following arterial surgery, including an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk following CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate this further we studied men and women's thromboembolic potential following CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Analysis of prospectively collected data on 775 consecutive CEAs performed between October 1995 and October 2001, to identify the number of microembolic events detected following CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall women had a 2.2 fold increase in the number of postoperative emboli detected (95% CI 1.2-3.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of those patients with significant numbers of postoperative emboli (&gt;25), 68% were female against 22% for men (p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to prevent progression onto postoperative thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 9.7% of women were treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran-40</z:chebi> therapy, as opposed to only 2.7% of men (p=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between men and women's preoperative risk factors and/or factors relating to their operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is possible that women's excess of postoperative complications following arterial surgery is related to their apparent increased thromboembolic potential following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> arterial injury </plain></SENT>
