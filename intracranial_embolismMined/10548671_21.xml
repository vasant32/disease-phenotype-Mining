<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated retrospectively residual CBF and other clinical factors related to outcome at 6 months after intra-arterial thrombolysis by using multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-six patients received intra-arterial thrombolysis within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The multiple regression method was used to analyze associations between the modified Rankin scale (MRS) at 6 months after treatment and clinical factors including age, infarction type, duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, dose of urokinase, degree of recanalization, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score (NIHSSS), and residual CBF evaluated by pretreatment single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission-computed tomography; these values were assessed with the use of the regional-to-cerebellar activity (R/CE) ratio of ischemic region to cerebellum and asymmetry index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MRS at 6 months was good (0 to 3) in 65% and poor (4 to 6) in 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly related to MRS at 6 months were R/CE ratio (P&lt;0.0001), NIHSSS at baseline and the following day (P&lt;0.0001), cardioembolic infarction (P=0.0014), age (P=0.0074), and recanalization grade (P=0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NIHSSS of &gt;20, R/CE ratio of &lt;0.35, cardioembolic infarction, incomplete recanalization (grade &lt;3), and older age (&gt;75 years) were determined to be significant independent predictors of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The residual CBF, neurological score at baseline and the following day, age, and recanalization grade correlated significantly with long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The NIHSSS of &gt;20 and R/CE ratio of &lt;0.35 were determined to be significant independent predictors of poor outcome by multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
