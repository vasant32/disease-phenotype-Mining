<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We report 81 patients with a traumatic intracerebellar hemorrhagic <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> managed between 1996 and 1998 at 13 Italian neurosurgical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Each center provided data about patients' clinicoradiological findings, management, and outcomes, which were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A poor result occurred in 36 patients (44.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients (55.6%) had favorable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of data analysis, patients were divided into two groups according to their admission Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Group 1 (39/81 cases; GCS score, &gt; or =8), the outcome was favorable in 95% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group 2 (42/81 cases; GCS score, &lt;8), the outcome was poor in 81% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients underwent posterior fossa surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors correlating with outcome were GCS score, status of the basal cisterns and the fourth ventricle, associated supratentorial traumatic lesions, mechanism of injury, and intracerebellar clot size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed significant independent prognostic effect only for GCS score (P = 0.000) and the concomitant presence of supratentorial lesions (P = 0.0035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study describes clinicoradiological findings and prognostic factors regarding traumatic cerebellar injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A general consensus emerged from this analysis that a conservative approach can be considered a viable, safe treatment option for noncomatose patients with intracerebellar clots measuring less than or equal to 3 cm, except when associated with other extradural or subdural posterior fossa focal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also, a general consensus was reached that surgery should be recommended for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with clots larger than 3 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis, biomechanics, and optimal management criteria of these rare lesions are still unclear, and larger observational studies are necessary </plain></SENT>
