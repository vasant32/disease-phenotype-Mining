<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From March 2002 through February 2004, bilateral axillary arterial perfusion was applied in 12 consecutive patients (mean age, 61.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Operative procedures were total arch replacement in 8 patients, hemiarch replacement in 1, and ascending aorta replacement in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antegrade selective cerebral perfusion was established through vascular grafts anastomosed to the bilateral axillary arteries and a perfusion catheter placed directly into the left carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral axillary arterial perfusion through the grafts was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no early or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no incidence of neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no complications related to cannulation of the axillary arteries </plain></SENT>
