<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Without recanalisation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar artery (BA) occlusion has a mortality of 90%, which is reduced to 50% if recanalisation is achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fast diagnosis of BA occlusion is necessary in order to start thrombolytic therapy without delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wanted to assess the role of CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients with clinically suspected BA occlusion were examined with conventional CT and spiral CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spiral scanning extended from the foramen magnum to the tip of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For CTA, 130 ml of nonionic contrast media were injected into an antecubital vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four patients, transfemoral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was additionally performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient had a follow-up CT examination the next day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CTA demonstrated BA occlusion in six patients and a partially thrombosed megadolichobasilar artery in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In four of the six patients with CT angiographically diagnosed BA occlusion, an additional DSA was performed, which confirmed the CTA findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In three patients the BA showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intravasal contrast, and follow-up CT did not show infarctions in the vertebrobasilar territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the number of cases is still small, CTA seems to be a promising method for the rapid diagnosis of BA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may become a valuable tool for therapy decisions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BA occlusions </plain></SENT>
