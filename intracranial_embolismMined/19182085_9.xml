<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 63 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients scheduled for TEE, territory and embolic pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> were prospectively assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multidirectional 3D MRI velocity mapping of the aorta was performed to correlate the extent of retrograde diastolic blood flow with the distance of complex DAo plaques from the left subclavian artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolic risk from the DAo was present for (1) retrograde flow connecting complex DAo plaques with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e>, (2) embolic pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in a territory supplied by the left vertebral artery, and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that could not be explained by other means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 33 of 63 patients had complex DAo plaques (distance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> 28.1+/-29.9 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean retrograde flow in these subjects was 26.2+/-12.3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 20 of 63 patients (31.7%) retrograde flow connected complex DAo plaques with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 4 of these 20 patients (20%) with an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of the brain stem, cerebellum or posterior cerebral artery, etiology could not be explained by other means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Substantial diastolic retrograde flow originating from complex plaques in the descending aorta was detected by multidirectional 3D MRI velocity mapping and constitutes a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism that was previously not demonstrable </plain></SENT>
