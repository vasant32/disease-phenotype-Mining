<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1,670 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were registered over 28 years, during which the female incidence of cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> increased by 19% (P less than 0.025), while the male mortality was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Women showed a percentage increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from cerebral thromboembolic attacks (CTA) of 33%, men a fall of 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase of female CTA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> was most pronounced in the young fertile group, the age group with a high OC use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A relative risk of CTA of 3.3-4.5 for OC users compared with non-users could explain the CTA trend difference between women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other single risk factor responsible for the observed trends could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both women and men had a significant increase in the mortality of subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, and a significant fall in the mortality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
