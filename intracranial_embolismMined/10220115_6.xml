<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The NGF level was determined by a two-site enzyme immunoassay specific for NGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of the embolized hemisphere maximally contained 2.4-, 2.4-, and 1.7-times higher NGF levels than the corresponding regions of the nonembolized hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant increase was transiently observed for 1 week in the cerebral cortex and striatum, whereas the increase was longer lasting, at least of 4 weeks' duration, in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To examine the localization of NGF-like immunoreactivity (NGF-LI), we used a newly developed anti-NGF <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> antiserum that specifically recognized a 30-kDa molecule(s) in the hippocampal extracts or in NGF cDNA-transfected cells, suggesting that the antibody predominantly reacted with the putative NGF precursor protein(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NGF-LI, which was localized in neurons of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or non-embolized hemisphere, was reduced, and on the embolized side new signals emerged in small non-neuronal cells having a round shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These included cells with common leukocyte antigen CD45 and T-lymphocyte antigen CD3, which did not appear in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or non-embolized hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NGF-LI and CD3 were colocalized in a substantial number of the cells, suggesting that some activated T-lymphocytes produce NGF for neuronal regeneration after sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
