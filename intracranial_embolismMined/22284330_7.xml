<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the cerebral embolic load of filter-protected versus proximal balloon-protected carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Randomized trials comparing filter-protected CAS with carotid endarterectomy revealed a higher periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proximal balloon occlusion may be more effective in preventing cerebral embolization during CAS than filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing CAS with cerebral embolic protection for internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were randomly assigned to proximal balloon occlusion or filter protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the incidence of new cerebral ischemic lesions assessed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were the number and volume of new ischemic lesions and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two consecutive patients (mean age: 71.7 years, 76.4% male) were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with filter protection (n = 31), proximal balloon occlusion (n = 31) resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of new cerebral ischemic lesions (45.2% vs. 87.1%, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number (median [range]: 2 [0 to 13] vs. 0 [0 to 4], p = 0.0001) and the volume (0.47 [0 to 2.4] cm(3) vs. 0 [0 to 0.84] cm(3), p = 0.0001) of new cerebral ischemic lesions were significantly reduced by proximal balloon occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lesions in the contralateral hemisphere were found in 29.0% and 6.5% of patients (filter vs. balloon occlusion, respectively, p = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 30-day MACCE rate was 3.2% and 0% for filter versus balloon occlusion, respectively (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial of patients undergoing CAS, proximal balloon occlusion as compared with filter protection significantly reduced the embolic load to the brain </plain></SENT>
