<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By using the femoral arterial approach, the internal carotid arteries of 14 cats were infused with an emulsion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> 0.05 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted (T2WI), diffusion-weighted (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) map, perfusion-weighted (PWI), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced T1-weighted (Gd-T1WI) images were obtained serially at 30 minutes and 2, 4, and 6 hours after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Qualitative evaluation was performed by assessing the signal intensity of the serial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative assessment was performed by comparing the signal-intensity ratio (SIR) of the lesions to the contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side calculated on T2WIs, Gd-T1WIs, DWIs, and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps at each acquisition time and by comparing the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit times (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) of the lesions to the contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side calculated on PWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the qualitative evaluation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, the lesions showed hyperintensity on T2WIs, enhancement on the Gd-T1WIs, and isointensity on DWIs and the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the quantitative studies, SIRs on the Gd-T1WIs, DWIs, and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps peaked at 2 hours after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SIRs on the T2WIs peaked at 4 hours after infusion and decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On PWIs, the rCBV, rCBF, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> of the lesion showed no significant difference from the contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side (P = .09, .30, and .13, respectively) and showed no significant change of time course (P = .17, .31, and .66, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The embolized lesions induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> emulsion showed no significant difference in cerebral hemodynamic parameters from those on the contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The result may suggest that consideration of the hemodynamic factor of embolized lesions is not necessary in further studies of the blood-brain barrier with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> emulsion </plain></SENT>
