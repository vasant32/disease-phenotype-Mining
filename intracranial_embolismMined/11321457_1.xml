<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular responses of cerebral arterioles to repeated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> embolism (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>)-reperfusion were examined when <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSMs</z:chebi> were injected twice through a carotid artery with a time interval of 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriolar diameter was measured from images of arterioles filled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52334">rhodamine-B</z:chebi> isothiocyanate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and red cell velocity was measured with a dual window technique using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labeled red cells as a flow tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> embolization induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (flow reduction including stasis) for approximately 10 min in the level of microvessels (arterioles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arterioles began to dilate immediately after embolism induced by the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> injection and vasodilation was sustained until reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion the arteriole began to constrict and the arteriolar diameter returned to the initial diameter level at approximately 20 min after the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The arteriolar diameters for the second <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> embolism showed a similar response to those for the first embolism in 7 out of 8 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that the vascular response of cerebral arterioles to the second embolism-reperfusion could not be affected by the first embolism-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
