<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within the same minute he developed left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> which lasted for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A CT of the brain three hours later was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We believe cerebral air emboli from his disconnected CVC caused the transitory ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This complication has previously been described several times and sometimes with air shown in the CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reason can be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> through an intracardial shunt or through physiological pulmonary arteriovenous shunts, or the air can pass retrogradely from the central vein to the cerebral venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When cerebral air emboli is suspected, the CVC must be secured, the patient should be placed in a recumbent position and given 100% O2, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy if symptoms persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While placing and handling a CVC, the patient should be in a recumbent position, and the increased risk for air emboli in walking patients be taken into account </plain></SENT>
