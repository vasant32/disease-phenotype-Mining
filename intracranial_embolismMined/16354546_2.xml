<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reports our experience with induced arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and selective etomidate cerebral protection in a cohort of patients who underwent CEA without shunting and continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively 102 consecutive CEAs performed in 102 patients with routine EEG monitoring and general anesthesia between March 1998 and October 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 65 (66%) symptomatic and 37 (34%) asymptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A protocol of induced arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> against EEG ischemic changes during carotid artery cross clamping was followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only patients with EEG changes refractory to induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> went into etomidate-induced burst suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EEG changes were classified as mild, moderate and severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (19.6%) developed asymmetric EEG changes, of which the great majority were mild and moderate (75%, p&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with moderate (n=3) and severe (n=4) EEG changes needed etomidate cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no mortalities and only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0.98%) is reported in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The morbidity rate was 6.8% and included transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> (n=5) and wound <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid endarterectomy can be safely performed with EEG monitoring and selective induced arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and etomidate cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that this method may be a good alternative for shunting and its inherent risks </plain></SENT>
