<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) have been reported in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> among patients with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main aim of the study is to clarify the pathophysiology of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty eight patients with a diagnosis of SLE (60 females, 8 males) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both middle cerebral arteries were monitored using transcranial Doppler for 60 min to detect <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases underwent neurology and psychiatry assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 7/68 patients (10.3%) with the mean number of 3.5 per hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were significantly higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement (6/24, 25%) than those without (1/44, 2.2%) (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SLE disease activity index, duration of disease, plaque formation, intima-media thickness, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were not associated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were more frequent in patients receiving Aspirin and/or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> may be a predictor for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement in SLE patients at risk for neuropsychiatric syndromes </plain></SENT>
