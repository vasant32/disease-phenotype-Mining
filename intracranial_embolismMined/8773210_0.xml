<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study concerns eleven patients who had suffered from a cerebro-vascular accident (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) less than 6 months previously and who were hospitalized for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to their multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatments, the patients consented to participate in an electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback program designed to increase their shoulder activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From blocks of five individual isometric contractions, curves of both the mean torque and of its standard deviation (SD) were generated and from each of these, a mean value was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two measures were used to analyze the effects on the biofeedback training had induced on shoulder activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The training induced negligible changes on the contralateral (CL) side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean torque value for the group was 31.02 post vs 30.99 Nm pre-training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, for the hemiplegic (HEMI) limbs, some patients showed improvement while others did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment was considered a success when the mean torque values obtained in the last 2/3 of the training or at the post-training session were &gt; or = 1.5 the values obtained during the pre-training session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on this criteria, it was found that six out of eleven patients did improve their muscular activity through the training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among these, the improvement of four was greater during the 2/3 session than that observed at the post-training session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The six successful patients were found to have a pre-training upper extremity Fugl-Meyer score &lt; or = 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a similar pre-training score of 11, and met the criteria of success, but the younger patient performed better than the older one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with scores of 20 and higher did not meet the 1.5 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A correlation (r = 0.80) was found between post/pre ratios of Fugl-Meyer scores and those of the mean torque: the test thus seems to have a limited usefulness for assessing local changes such as the effects of the biofeedback treatment on the shoulder </plain></SENT>
