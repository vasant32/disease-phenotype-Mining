<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An embolic event is a common and severe complication of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> are known to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e>, their pathogenic role in infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> has not been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relationship among the occurrence of major embolic events, echocardiographic vegetation size, endothelial cell activation, thrombin generation, fibrinolysis and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> was examined in 91 patients with definite infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, including 26 patients with embolic events and 65 control subjects without embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 14.3% of patients exhibited elevated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embolic events occurred more frequently in patients with elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> than in patients without (61.5% vs. 23.1%; p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> showed higher levels of prothrombin-fragment F1 +2 (p = 0.005), plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1 (p = 0.0002), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (p = 0.002) and lower levels of activated protein C (p = 0.001) than patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombin generation and endothelial cell activation were both positively correlated with levels of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of elevated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> levels was frequently associated with structural valve abnormalities (p = 0.01) and vegetations &gt;1.3 cm (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e>-associated elevated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> levels in patients with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> are related to endothelial cell activation, thrombin generation and impairment of fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to the increased risk for major embolic events in these patients </plain></SENT>
