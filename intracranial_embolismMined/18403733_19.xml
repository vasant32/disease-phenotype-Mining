<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While a cap thickness &lt;65 microm is the accepted definition of rupture-prone plaque in the coronary circulation, the threshold value for carotid plaques is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We made detailed histological assessments of 526 carotid plaques from consecutive patients undergoing endarterectomy for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the fibrous cap at the thinnest and most representative part was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cap thickness could be measured reliably in 428 (81%) plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ruptured plaques (n=257), the median representative cap thickness was 300 microm (IQR 200 to 500 microm) and the median minimum cap thickness was 150 microm (80 to 210 microm; mean=181 microm), which is much greater than the mean cap thickness of 23 microm at the point of rupture that has been reported for coronary plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For nonruptured plaques, the median cap thickness values were 500 microm (300 to 700 microm) and 250 microm (180 to 400 microm), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimum cut-offs for discriminating between ruptured and nonruptured plaques were a minimum cap thickness &lt;200 microm (OR 5.00, 3.26 to 7.65, P&lt;0.001), a representative cap thickness &lt;500 microm (OR 3.38, 2.25 to 5.08, P&lt;0.001), or a combination of both (OR 5.11, 3.19 to 8.19, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minimum and representative cap thickness were only modestly correlated (r(2)=0.30) and were both independently associated with cap rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Critical cap thickness is greater in carotid plaques than coronary plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Minimum and representative cap thicknesses were both independently associated with cap rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A combination of minimum cap thickness &lt;200 microm and a representative cap thickness &lt;500 microm identified ruptured plaques most reliably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prospective imaging studies are required to establish whether these cut points predict clinical events in patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
