<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The statistical evaluation of the electroencephalographic changes (quantified EEG analysis, QEEG) due to the ischemic event showed that the early treatment (1-3-24 h) with GM1 reduced the EEgraphic pattern typical of this model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering the observation period, we hypothesized that it was due to the formation of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> of a lesser degree compared to the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Particularly, we did not obtain the increase in delta activity on the contralateral hemisphere, which we thought was expression of the diaschisi phenomenon </plain></SENT>
