<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a randomized, blinded controlled trial to test the efficacy of fibrinolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was simulated in rabbits by injecting three 0.5 x 0.5 mm fragments of autologous arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> harvested from a traumatized auricular artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after embolization the rabbits were blindly treated with tissue plasminogen activator (n = 21), urokinase (n = 20), or 0.9% saline (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 6 hours the rabbits were sacrificed, and the cerebral vasculature was inspected for the location and number of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain was then cut into 0.5-cm-thick coronal sections and stained with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> to define areas of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with either tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase significantly reduced the number of emboli present in the cerebral circulation (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area of ischemic injury was also significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> fibrinolytic therapy with either tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, only treatment with tissue plasminogen activator significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) the incidence of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in any rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early fibrinolytic therapy improved outcome in this model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
