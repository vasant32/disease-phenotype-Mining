<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During these years a subresponsive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> state with neurological signs extending from the oculomotor nuclei to the trigeminal and facial nuclei levels was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A decorticated type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo>, with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> of the limbs accompanied by pyramidal signs, was also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EEG during the first months showed slow activity which afterwards gradually changed towards fast and alpha activities, maintained in the course of the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathological diagnosis was a fibrous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014100" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endarteritis</z:e>, mainly in the territory of the basilar and vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pons and midbrain, presenting a large cystic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, were serially studied to determine the anatomical extent of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After reviewing other examples from the literature, the clinical features of our case are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The evolution of the EEG is related to different structures of the ponto-mesencephalic region with different functional activities </plain></SENT>
