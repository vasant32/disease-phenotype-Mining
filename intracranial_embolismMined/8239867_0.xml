<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were selected according to echocardiographic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> was comparable to that of patients without previous surgical commissurotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with good hemodynamic result had undergone surgical commissurotomy more recently and had less severe valvular damage than patients with an incomplete (n = 10) or poor result (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient died of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during the procedure, two patients underwent emergency surgery for a mitral valve rupture and 4 patients had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> with Qp/Qs ratio greater than 1.5 by oximetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of successes and complications were comparable to those observed in patients without previous surgical commissurotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients who had undergone previous surgical commissurotomy were followed up for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, 4 remained in Class II of the NYHA classification, 44 (74%) were improved by at least 1 functional class and 10 (17%) had required a mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty is therefore a useful procedure in patients with moderate degrees of valvular disease who develop restenosis after surgical commissurotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A functional improvement can be expected in 3/4 of patients Complications related to the procedure are rare and acceptable compared with the risks of a second thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Failure of percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty is generally due to the degree of valvular disease which contraindicated surgical commissurotomy and required mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
