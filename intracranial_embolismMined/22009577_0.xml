<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate a novel device that was developed to direct emboli away from the internal carotid artery to the external carotid artery to prevent embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> while avoiding the necessity for anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A stent-like, self-expandable filter was developed consisting of fine <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> alloy mesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After promising preclinical animal testing, the device was implanted into the common carotid artery extending into the external carotid artery in three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, each of whom were at high-risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and were suboptimal candidates for anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was performed clinically and with carotid duplex ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The implantation was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unrestricted flow through the filter was demonstrated in each patient at 6 months by duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, at 7 months ultrasound demonstrated occlusion of the internal carotid artery filter in one patient, which was subsequently confirmed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subtotal filter occlusion occurred in a second patient at 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither patient had clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both internal carotid arteries were successfully recanalized using standard angioplasty techniques without complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The third patient had completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid blood flow at 29 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of a novel device intended to divert emboli away from the internal carotid artery was feasible, but resulted in occlusive neointimal proliferation in two of three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate a discrepancy from the findings of preclinical animal studies and human investigation </plain></SENT>
