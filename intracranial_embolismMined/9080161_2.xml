<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was also used to determine any relationship between quantitative electroencephalography changes and type of oxygenator used in surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 61 coronary artery bypass graft patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anaesthesia included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi>, fentanyl and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29796">N2O </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed with hypothermic bypass (28 degrees C), arterial pressure of 50-70 mmHg, and alpha-stat, using bubble (Harvey 1700), or membrane (Cobe <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) oxygenators, both with arterial line filters (Pall 40 microns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main finding was a significant increase in delta power at the end of perfusion (P &lt; 0.01), which showed a positive association with delta power before the start of perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marked quantitative electroencephalography change at the end of perfusion was not related to systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, temperature, type of oxygenator, bypass time, or patient age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative quantitative electroencephalography changes found in most patients were transient and could not be related to postoperative cerebral function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 16 of the 18 patients who had neuropsychological deficit 2 months after surgery, also had a significant quantitative electroencephalography change at the end of perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While no difference in <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> technique was found between patients, the variation in quantitative electroencephalography power before perfusion may indicate a difference in individual response to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Usefulness of quantitative electroencephalography to predict postoperative cerebral functional deficit remains doubtful </plain></SENT>
