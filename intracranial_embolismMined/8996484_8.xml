<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) devices are increasingly used in the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, but their value in patients after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is unknown, despite the fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and many patients have relatively <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> (BP) levels at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the clinical use of a 24-hour oscillometric ABPM device in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated ABPM in different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>) and ethnic and sex differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BP was measured manually with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer, and ABPM measurements were made with an oscillometric device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first reading obtained with the ABPM device was compared with simultaneous manual BP measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean daytime and nighttime pressures were also analyzed to determine the frequency of nocturnal BP <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> ("dipping") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 86 patients (48 men; mean +/- SD age, 64.2 +/- 9.2 years) admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (ictus within 12 hours) in a district general hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients (36.0%) had a previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median percentage of successful BP readings by ABPM was 92% (interquartile range, 72 to 98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in manual BP levels compared with the first simultaneous systolic or diastolic ABPM measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Systolic BPs recorded by ABPM were significantly higher in black patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, who also showed a trend toward higher nocturnal BPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in BPs between men and women and those who were alive or dead 6 months later (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was also no difference between mean day and night systolic BP (mean difference, 1.9 mm Hg; P = .08), although mean daytime diastolic BP was higher than mean nighttime diastolic BP (mean difference, 2.4 mm Hg; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therefore demonstrated a loss of diurnal BP rhythm and may be considered "nondippers"; there was also a trend toward "reverse dipping" in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates higher systolic BPs as recorded by ABPM (but not manually) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> than in those with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; higher levels were also found in blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>ABPM recordings are useful in the assessment of BP in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, who may be considered nondippers </plain></SENT>
