<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the various abnormalities studied, this imaging technique was particularly useful in diagnosing venous and dural sinus abnormalities; in screening for suspected large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, vascular malformations, and major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e>; and in preoperative vascular mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IV digital subtraction angiography has selected usefulness in confirming brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, in evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, in identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and in evaluating vascularity and sinus extension of masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IV route for digital subtraction angiography is not useful in diagnosing segmental arterial occlusive or small-vessel disease, nor is it useful in preoperative localization of specific arterial supply to arterial venous malformations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
