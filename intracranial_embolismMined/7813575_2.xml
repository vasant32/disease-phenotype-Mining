<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a model whereby the middle cerebral artery in an experimental animal can be occluded by a photochemical reaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and green light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This causes endothelial injury followed by platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, aggregation and formation of a platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> at the site of the photochemical reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUN9216, a modified tissue-type plasminogen activator, is a new thrombolytic agent which consists of the fibrin kringle 1 domain of plasminogen and the two kringles, the serine protease domains of the native tissue-type plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> glycosylation site on the kringle 1 of tissue-type plasminogen activator is modified to yield a compound with a longer half-life in the blood than native tissue-type plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the thrombolytic effects of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator and SUN9216 in the thrombotically occluded rat middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUN9216 was administered by continuous infusion or as a single bolus injection 30 min after the middle cerebral artery had been occluded by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both SUN9216 and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator caused reopening of the middle cerebral artery by thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of SUN9216 was higher than that of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, the area of ischaemic cerebral damage caused by the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced by SUN9216, but in this respect, recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator was ineffective </plain></SENT>
