<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Perfluorocarbon emulsion has proved beneficial in the prevention and amelioration of experimental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the addition of perfluorocarbon to the prime solution could lead to a reduction in the incidence and severity of neurologic injury after the formation of a massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen pigs underwent bypass in which either a crystalloid prime solution or a perfluorocarbon prime solution (10 mL/kg) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes into bypass a bolus (5 mL/kg) of air or saline (control) was delivered via the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were graded on the basis of the findings in triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-stained cerebral sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colored microspheres were used to measure cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bitemporal electroencephalography was used to evaluate cerebral function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was not found in the perfluorocarbon-air group (0 to 5 animals), as compared with its occurrence in 3 of the 5 animals in the crystalloid-air group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was also maintained or increased in the perfluorocarbon-air group (p &lt; 0.05), and the electroencephalogram total power showed less of a decrease and recovered more completely (p &lt; 0.05) than it did in the crystalloid-air group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of perfluorocarbon emulsion to the cardiopulmonary bypass prime solution leads to a reduction in the incidence and severity of neurologic injury after the formation of a massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> during bypass </plain></SENT>
