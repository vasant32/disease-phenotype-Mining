<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High-intensity transient signals (HITS) are frequently detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53390">PHVs</z:chebi>), but published data about their clinical relevance are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine the clinical relevance of HITS in patients with mechanical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53390">PHVs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors prospectively studied patients with mechanical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53390">PHVs</z:chebi> using TCD monitoring for microemboli detection with and without O2 inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cognitive testing of patients included the Mini-Mental State Examination, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale, and MicroCog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors studied 36 patients (20 women, aged 58 +/- 13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HITS were detected in 72% of patients, with a nonsignificant increase of HITS rate in the aortic valve group (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in HITS rate between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multiple linear regression model, HITS rate was predicted only by younger age (P = .024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between HITS rate and the cognitive performance of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in HITS rate after 100% O2 inhalation compared to baseline levels (32.8 +/- 40.2 vs 6.1 +/- 11.3, P = .011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis in asymptomatic patients confirmed this finding (P = .017), but in symptomatic patients, decreased HITS rate was not statistically significant (P = .18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Only age was a significant predictor of HITS in patients with mechanical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53390">PHVs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The lack of association between HITS, clinical symptoms, and cognitive functioning suggests that most of these signals represent harmless epiphenomena, and only HITS detected after O2 inhalation have any clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
