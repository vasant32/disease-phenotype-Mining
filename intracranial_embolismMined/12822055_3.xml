<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of matched healthy controls was tested at identical intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli in both middle cerebral arteries were quantified during surgery using Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological testing results revealed that the CABG and VR groups did not differ from one another at any assessment point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, surgical patients performed more poorly than healthy controls across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical patients, as a group, demonstrated a mild decline in attentional functioning and learning efficiency at the 7-10 day follow-up, but these difficulties essentially returned to baseline by the 1-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative microemboli counts were not significantly associated with postsurgical neuropsychological functioning in either the CABG or VR group </plain></SENT>
