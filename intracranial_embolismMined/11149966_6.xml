<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Often, the etiology of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is known before surgical intervention, ie, evacuation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a subset of patients, however, no known cause for the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> has been found in either history (eg, trauma) or radiographic findings (eg, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>) before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed 54 blood clot evacuation specimens received in the surgical pathology department over a 16-year period (1983-1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were excluded in which the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was attributed to or associated with prior trauma or for which there was a prior known cause of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one cases fulfilled the study requirements and comprised the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients (aged 7 to 79 years; mean 54 years), including 16 females and 15 males, formed the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 14 cases (45%), only blood clot was identified in the tissues examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 17 cases, specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathologic diagnoses</z:e> were made in nine instances including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> in three cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> in three cases, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> types included metastatic non-small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in two cases and low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Examination of blood clot evacuation specimens can lead to a discovery of the etiology of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in a subset of cases, particularly if neural tissue is part of the specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The quantity of neural tissue submitted for histologic evaluation seems to correlate with a higher likelihood of making a diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The routine use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> stain in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult cases in which brain tissue is present proved to be of diagnostic utility in screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
