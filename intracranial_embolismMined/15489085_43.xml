<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination of antiplatelet and moderate-intensity anticoagulation therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> associated with recognized risk factors or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> was more effective than aspirin in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in these patients; combined therapy with low <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> intensity was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>Mitral stenosis</z:hpo> patients were not investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a multicenter randomized trial in 1,209 patients at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intermediate-risk group included patients with risk factors or age &gt;60 years: 242 received the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35544">cyclooxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi> triflusal, 237 received acenocumarol, and 235 received a combination of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high-risk group included patients with prior embolism or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo>: 259 received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and 236 received the combined therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 2.76 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was a composite of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary outcome was lower in the combined therapy than in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> arm in both the intermediate- (hazard ratio [HR] 0.33 [95% confidence interval (CI)0.12 to 0.91]; p = 0.02) and the high-risk group (HR 0.51 [95% CI 0.27 to 0.96]; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome plus severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was lower with combined therapy in the intermediate-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonvalvular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> patients had similar embolic event rates during <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combined antiplatelet plus moderate-intensity anticoagulation therapy significantly decreased the vascular events compared with anticoagulation alone and proved to be safe in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
