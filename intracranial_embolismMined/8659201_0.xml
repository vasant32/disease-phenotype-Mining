<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether potential sources of embolism such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and atherosclerotic aortic debris can influence the outcome of patients after first cerebral ischemic event (CIE), 214 patients (124 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 21 RIND, 69 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) were examined by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) up to 3 weeks after CIE and followed up for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For risk estimation, the patients were subdivided into group I = without and group II = with potential sources of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We additionally took into account <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and atherosclerotic risk factors (group la + IIa without, Ib + IIb with) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrence occurred in 14 out of 214 patients (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and aortic debris as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and atherosclerotic risk factors was associated with a twofold to threefold higher incidence of recurrent events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While potential sources of embolism alone had no influence on the recurrence rate (group I:8/111 = 7.2% versus group II: 6/103 = 5.8%, n.s.), this was significantly different in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and atherosclerotic risk factors (groups Ia + IIa: 0/66 = 0%, groups Ib + IIb: 14/148 = 9.8%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that potential sources of embolism do not appear to influence the recurrence rate in cardiac healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, however, potential sources of embolism are associated with a higher risk of recurrence, and should therefore be imaged by TEE </plain></SENT>
