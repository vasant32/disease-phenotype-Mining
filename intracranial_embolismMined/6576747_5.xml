<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An analysis is presented of the first 700 admissions to the Austin Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Unit with special emphasis on the incidence of the various patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the underlying mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 616 admissions for confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events--the remainder were for events simulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and fifty-three (57.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events) were for cortical (including <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi>) ischaemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, arterial lesions were demonstrated in 55% and suspected in 20% whilst embolism from the heart probably accounted for 14% of events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No cause was determined in 11% despite complete investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Where arterial lesions were found, they were extracranial in 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 140 cases of internal capsular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (22.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events) and 16 cases (2.6%) for which the exact site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was not determined, although it was presumed to have occurred within the carotid territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vertebrobasilar ischaemic events were responsible for 71 admissions (11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 36 cases of primary intracerebral haemorrhage (5.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This survey has highlighted some aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> requiring further research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These include the elucidation of cortical and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ischaemic events of unknown aetiology, the possible role of large vessel lesions in the pathogenesis of capsular ischaemic events and pathologic mechanisms involved in ischaemic events of the vertebrobasilar territory </plain></SENT>
