<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and particularly of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A likely explanation is the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> at the carotid level, favored by increased local stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another possibility involves cardiac consequences of aortic stiffness and particularly left atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> with its subsequent risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The present study investigated the link between arterial stiffness, pulse pressure and left atrial size, a determinant of AF risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Arterial stiffness was determined from pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pulse pressure (PP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left atrial size was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several potential confounders were taken into account including indices of ventricular remodeling and diastolic function (estimated by NT-Pro brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP) levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three-hundred and ten hypertensive patients, aged 53 +/- 13 years, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean 24-h blood pressure (BP) was 154 +/- 20 over 93 +/- 13 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant relationships were found between left atrial diameter (LAD) and PWV (r=0.27, P&lt;0.001) and between LAD and 24-h PP (r=0.32, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LAD was also correlated significantly, although not always tightly, with left ventricular dimensions, geometry and NT-proBNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In two different multivariate models, LAD remained significantly correlated with PWV or with 24-h PP, independently of classical determinants like age, gender, body mass index, ventricular remodeling (i.e. dimensions and geometry) and filling pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results led us to propose AF as a new possible pathophysiological link between arterial stiffness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results also emphasize the cardiac consequences of arterial stiffness which can fuel a new approach to AF prevention </plain></SENT>
