<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>-intoxicated and non-intoxicated rats, some endothelial cells, mainly in arteries and arterioles, showed a diffuse distribution of peroxidase in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In some arterioles with a diffuse endothelial distribution of peroxidase there was a detachment of endothelial cells from the vessel wall, with an exposure of the adluminal basement membrane to blood elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This endothelial detachment was mainly observed in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>-intoxicated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vascular basement membranes underlying detached endothelial cells contained peroxidase, both in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>-intoxicated and in non-intoxicated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a considerable leakage of peroxidase via endothelial pinocytotic vesicles into the vascular basement membranes, mainly in arterioles, but also in capillaries and venules of the embolised hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This transendothelial pinocytotic transport of peroxidase was more prominent in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>-intoxicated than in non-intoxicated rats </plain></SENT>
