<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this paper is to study the short term evolution of 167 patients, aged between 15 and 45 years, with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 1986 a protocolized study has been made of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients aged between 15 and 45 who were admitted to the Neurology Department of the Hospital General Universitario in Valencia for a cerebral vascular incident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results obtained up to 1993 have been recorded in a data base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper the demographic data and information as to intrahospital evolution have been used with the Canadian, modified Rankin and Barthel Scales in the various ictus groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 28.7% of the patients were AIT and 71.3% were diagnosed as established ictus, of whom 38.8% were haemorrhagic and 61.2% were ischaemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>29.8% of the HIP, 33.3% of the embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 18.2% of the atherothrombotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were severely disabled on discharge from hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 4.2% when AIT were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Most studies are basically aetiopathological and much fewer include evaluation of prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our series, the patients had a satisfactory clinical course and low short-term mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As in the other series, the two groups with the worst prognosis were the HIP and the cardioembolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with HSA and HIV made outstandingly good progress </plain></SENT>
