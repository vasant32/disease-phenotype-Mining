<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in elderly patients <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy is often underused owing to the perceived higher risk of hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> control and the incidence of hemorrhagic complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in an elderly population (&gt;75 years old) compared with a younger control group (between 60 and 69 years) and to assess the quality of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> control and incidence of hemorrhagic complications in those patients who recently commenced receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy (first year of therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective follow-up study, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> control and the incidence of hemorrhagic complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were assessed in an elderly population (&gt;75 years old) compared with a younger control group (between 60 and 69 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>(target international normalized ratio [INR] 2.5) and attending a hospital outpatient <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 328 patients were studied over a 21-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 204 patients in the control group providing 288 patient-years of follow-up and 124 patients in the elderly group providing 170 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of INR results in the target range was not statistically significantly different between the elderly and control groups (71.5% vs 66.1%) and the occurrences of incidences of INR greater than 7 were 4.2% in the control group and 4.7% in the elderly group (P =.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidences of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were 2.8% per year in the elderly group and 2.9% per year in the control group (P =.96); overall incidence was 2.8% (95% confidence interval, 1.3%-4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred one of the 328 patients studied commenced <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy during or within 3 months of the start of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this induction group, 62.1% of INRs were within the target range compared with 70.9% of INRs in patients who had been receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy for more than 3 months at the start of the study (P =.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidences of INR greater than 7 and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were 7.9% per year and 6.9% per year, respectively, in the cohort who recently began <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy compared with 3.4% per year and 1.7% per year in the group who were receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy for more than 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While it was impossible to consider any selection bias at the level of referral to the clinic, these findings suggest that the elderly population attending our <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> clinic did not have poorer <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> control or an increased incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> while receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
