<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has improved the diagnostic evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, permitting detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to evaluate the distribution of potential cardioembolic sources in young versus older <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and their clinical implication for recurrent vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and twenty-eight patients with undetermined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were submitted to transthoracic and to TEE examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 43 +/- 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall detection of cardiac sources of embolism was significantly higher in younger than in older patients (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atrial septal abnormalities were more prevalent in the younger than in the older population (P = 0.006), whereas complicated aortic plaques were detected more often in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period of 4-5 years, we identified 40 recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> episodes or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As expected, there was a significant difference in recurrent vascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of older patients compared to the younger ones (P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that atrial septal abnormalities and aortic atheromas are the most prevalent echocardiographic findings in young and elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complicated aortic atheroma is strictly correlated with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebral vascular events</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
