<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the medical records of 60 consecutive patients (28 men and 32 women; aged from 13 to 63 years) with the diagnosis of dissection of the internal carotid artery (ICA), and with available clinical and neurosonological follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten cases occurred after trauma and 50 cases were spontaneous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiographic evidence of fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the ICA was found in 23% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> or neck pain associated with focal cerebral ischemic symptoms or oculosympathetic palsy were the most common findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Less frequent symptoms such as isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> and pulsating bruits were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 3 to 144 months (mean, 37.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A favourable outcome occurred in 73.7% of the cases with a follow-up of 6 months or more, and seemed to depend on the severity of the ischemic cerebral deficit associated with the ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>68% (41/60 cases) of our patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 18% (11/60 cases) experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, which occurred as the initial manifestation of the ICA dissection in 28.8% (15/52 cases) of the cases, and with a delay (more than 24 hours) in the other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evidence of embolization in the cerebral arteries was found in 36% of the cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (15/41 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, given in 34 of our patients, seems to be justified by the fact that a considerable risk exists for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in association with ICA dissections; no serious neurological complications were observed in our series as a result of this <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Doppler sonography follow-up diagnosed a recanalization in 67.8% of the stenotic or occlusive dissections, most of them being completed within the first 6 months (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of ICA dissection is exceptional but occurred in one of our 60 cases, 2.5 years after the first event </plain></SENT>
