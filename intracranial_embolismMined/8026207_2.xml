<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used an experimental multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> model to test whether treatment with tirilazad (U74006F), a putative inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, would improve functional outcome after multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Animal care facility procedure room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: A total of 44 New Zealand White rabbits weighing 2 to 3.0 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Variable quantities of 125I-labeled 50-microns microspheres were injected via a carotid catheter to produce multifocal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rabbits randomly received either: tirilazad (3 mg/kg i.v.) 5 mins before embolization (pretreatment), or 30 mins after embolization (posttreatment) followed by 1.5 mg/kg every 5 hrs x 3 doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A third group received vehicle only (control) 5 mins before, followed by three doses every 5 hrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The animals were rated by a blinded observer at 18 hrs after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and scored as either grossly abnormal/dead or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed and the amount of microspheres in the brain that were required to produce abnormal function at 18 hrs was calculated for each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To determine if tirilazad also modified leukocyte function during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to laminin was determined at baseline and 18 hrs after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> using a myeloperoxidase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this study, pretreatment, but not posttreatment with tirilazad produced a significant reduction in neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Tirilazad also attenuated postischemic increases in neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tirilazad pretreatment reduces neurologic deficits from multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This significant protective effect suggests that pretreatment with tirilazad may play a role in clinical situations where the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> is high, with changes in leukocyte adherence as a potential mechanism </plain></SENT>
