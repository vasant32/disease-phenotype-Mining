<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a recent experimental study showed that tPA increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in a mouse model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, suggesting a possible adverse effect of tPA on ischemic tissue per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, the effects of tPA in two rat models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In experiment 1, rats were subjected to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> via injection of autologous clots into the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hours after clot injection, rats were treated with 10 mg/kg tPA or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-sensitive computed tomography scanning showed that tPA restored cerebral perfusion in this thromboembolic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with tPA significantly reduced ischemic lesion volumes measured at 24 hours by &gt;60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, three groups of rats were subjected to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> via a mechanical approach in which a silicon-coated filament was used intraluminally to occlude the origin of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two groups, the filament was withdrawn after 2 hours to allow for reperfusion, and then rats were randomly treated with 10 mg/kg tPA or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the third group, rats were not treated and the filament was not withdrawn so that permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this experiment, tPA did not significantly alter lesion volumes after 2 hours of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> significantly increased lesion volumes by 55% compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in these rat models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, tPA did not have detectable negative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other potentially negative effects of tPA may be dependent on choice of animal species and model systems </plain></SENT>
