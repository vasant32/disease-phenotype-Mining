<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixty asymptomatic patients (age 26 +/- 10 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> were followed prospectively for 2.4 +/- 1.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on previous echocardiographic end-systolic dimension (ESD) and angiographic ejection fraction (EF) correlations, the cohort was divided into group A (21 patients) with ESD greater than or equal to 48 mm and group B (39 patients) with ESD less than 48 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group B had a faster ESD progression (NS) and 19 crossed over to group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with ESD greater than 48 mm, reached designated end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and 12 (age 31.4 +/- 10.6 years) required aortic valve replacement (AVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 9 of 12 were asymptomatic and 11 of 12 had significant left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The preoperative ESD of 51.9 +/- 4.1 mm fell to 38.4 +/- 3.6 mm (p less than 0.001) postoperatively and the EF of 43.7 +/- 4.16 increased to 64.9 +/- 5.9 (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found (1) the progression was faster than in other series; (2) ESD greater than 48 mm was associated with significant progression; and (3) patients with EF above 40% showed no residual LVD after AVR </plain></SENT>
