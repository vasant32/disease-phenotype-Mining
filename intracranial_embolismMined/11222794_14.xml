<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis in a series of nonselected patients and the coexistence of microembolic signals with stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis was sought by transcranial Doppler (TCD) in 387 patients admitted consecutively with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic cerebrovascular disease within the first 48 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and again at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring for microembolic signals was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses were found in 29 patients (7%), although in only 20 patients (5%) was the stenosis symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals were detected in five of 14 symptomatic stenoses (36%) monitored at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, but none were found in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase or in asymptomatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite one third of symptomatic patients having had a further source of emboli, microembolic signals were detected only distally to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the symptomatic group, 25% of stenoses had completely disappeared 6 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signal detection at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase was associated with the subsequent disappearance of the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was 5% in the population studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many stenoses are transient, and microembolic signals are often detectable at the poststenotic segment in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The origin of at least 25% of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses may be embolic rather than atherosclerotic </plain></SENT>
