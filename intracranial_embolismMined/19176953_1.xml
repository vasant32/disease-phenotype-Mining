<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have noted the presence of small strip-like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving the cortex within the interdivisional territory of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and sometimes extending to the periventricular region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit population, mechanisms, clinical expression and prognosis of patients with these cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify these issues we retrospectively and prospectively identified these patients in our own <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were identified retrospectively and prospectively from the Austin Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Unit from March 2001 to May 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were selected on the basis of the recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological deficit with imaging showing strip infarction within the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical features were recorded and the mechanism of infarction was classified based on the TOAST criteria from standard investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 4,274 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> admissions, there were 24 patients (0.6%), 12 males and 12 females (mean age 75 years; range 44-92 years) with CT or MRI showing characteristic linear infarction in the middle cerebral territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most cases, infarction was adjacent to the central sulcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Common clinical features included mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> with cortical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common TOAST criterion mechanism categories were artery-to-artery or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that this resulted in either isolated small cortical artery branch occlusion or borderzone infarction between superior and inferior divisions of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> due to more proximal large-artery vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We describe the phenotypic expression, postulated mechanisms and prognosis of strip-like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> between the superior and inferior <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> divisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The likely artery-artery or cardio-embolic mechanisms should prompt clinicians to search for an embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While the prognosis of the syndrome is generally good, its recognition may allow specific therapies to be developed to improve clinical outcomes further </plain></SENT>
