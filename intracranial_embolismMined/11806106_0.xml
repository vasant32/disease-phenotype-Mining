<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DWI) appears to be the most sensitive technique for detecting early and small ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the incidence and radiological features of embolic events associated with neuro-intervention, we applied DWI to screening for procedure-related ischemic lesions including silent embolisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-seven patients who have received 154 neuro-interventional procedures were studied with DWI before and within 5 days after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed, using single-shot echo-planar imaging with b value of 1000-1100 sec/mm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DWI findings were classified into 5 groups by size and location of lesions: type 0 (n = 71), no lesions; I (n = 33), lesions in border-zone regions only; II (n = 9), lesions at perforator territories mainly; III (n = 29), small territorial lesions (&lt; 5 mm); IV (n = 12), large territorial lesions (&gt; or = 5 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DWI detected procedure-related lesions in 83 of 154 procedures (53.9%), 36 of which demonstrated new neurological symptoms during and/or after procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> had a higher incidence of symptomatic embolisms than other procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 71 of 154 procedures (46.1%), DWI detected no lesions (type 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although type I was the most frequent pattern presented, it included few neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Type III often resulted in transient symptoms, and type II and IV tended to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because ischemic lesions detected by DWI were likely to arise in border-zone territories by parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>, we considered that hypoperfusion as well as emboli were involved in the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, DWI is a useful method to detect silent embolisms, and to determine the safety of neuro-intervention and the mechanism of embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
