<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who underwent angioplasty of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were eligible for CAS if they presented within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and had a National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score &gt;4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (11 men; mean age 68.3+/-14.3 years) who underwent endovascular intervention in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related extracranial ICA between May 2003 and February 2006 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (77.8%) had atheromatous obstructions and 4 (22.2%) had dissection of the extracranial ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major adverse cerebral and cardiac events (MACCEs) and neurological status, including NIHSS and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, were recorded for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful revascularization was achieved in 83.3% (15/18) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protection devices were applied successfully in 13 (72.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At discharge, a neurological improvement (NIHSS reduction &gt; or =4) was observed in 77.8% (14/18) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical success rate was 72.2% (13/18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median NIHSS was 8.5 on admission versus 4.5 at discharge (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 11.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the 14.6+/-9.3-month follow-up, the MACCE and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were 33.3% and 27.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median mRS scores at 30 days and at midterm follow-up were 1 and 2.5, respectively (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular revascularization of the extracranial ICA in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is associated with high procedural success rates and favorable midterm outcome </plain></SENT>
