<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Workup included coronary angiography and a left ventriculogram, during which air was inadvertently injected, resulting in the development of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> right hemisphere syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Right carotid angiography was immediately performed, yielding only a delayed diffuse venous phase without focal vessel cutoffs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 60 minutes, the patient underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the suspected cerebral air emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After removal from the chamber for technical reasons, she had a generalized tonic-clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, and further hyperbaric oxygen therapy was withheld </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial computed tomography imaging obtained approximately 8 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> showed signs of early right hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging studies were markedly abnormal and suggestive of diffuse bilateral but predominantly right-sided parietal lobe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> with mildly positive diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and the patient's neurological examination returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
