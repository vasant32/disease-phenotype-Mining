<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>Air embolism</z:mpath> was produced by injecting air bubbles into the carotid artery of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats breathing 100% oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were assessed on electrocorticogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an additional set of experiments, mass spectrometry was used to provide continuous monitoring of intracerebral tissue oxygen (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi>) and carbon dioxide (PCO2) tensions and intermittent measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="12" ids="38824">Fluorocarbon</z:chebi> or saline solution (containing the emulsifying agent of <z:chebi fb="12" ids="38824">fluorocarbons</z:chebi>) was given intravenously after the initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> (0.2 ml), and injections of air (0.1 ml) were repeated thereafter every five minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximal amount of air required to achieve complete and irreversible flattening of the electrocorticogram was 1.60 +/- 0.06 ml (mean +/- standard error of the mean) in the saline-treated rats and 5.20 +/- 0.44 ml in the <z:chebi fb="12" ids="38824">fluorocarbon</z:chebi>-treated group (p less than 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> caused CBF to rise in both groups, the average percent of increase being higher in treated (41.6%) than in control animals (38.3%) (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the control group, the increase in CBF did not prevent intracerebral tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> from decreasing by 7.4 +/- 7.0% over the same period; conversely, in the <z:chebi fb="12" ids="38824">fluorocarbon</z:chebi> group, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> levels fell by only 2.5 +/- 3.7% (p less than 0.001 versus controls), but this time-averaged percentage was calculated over a longer period of cumulative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> because of the greater number of air emboli tolerated by treated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
