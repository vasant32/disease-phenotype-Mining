<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 3000 patients have had cardiac catheterization in the Andreas Gruentzig Cardiovascular Laboratory of the Emory Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this presentation is to describe the patient population selected for this procedure and our experience with this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concept of catheterization as an outpatient is attractive from the standpoint of cost savings and time conservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety has been questioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have found that this technique can be performed safely in carefully selected outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Careful selection attempted to eliminate those with unstable symptoms, recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, severe <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small catheters were used to minimize the potential for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excellent opacification of vessels was obtained with these catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite careful screening we found 2.2% had significant left main obstruction, 10.8% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856738" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">triple-vessel disease</z:e>, 16.0% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919945" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">double-vessel disease</z:e>, and 23.5% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856737" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">single-vessel disease</z:e>, and a similar percentage had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteriograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> on five occasions, there were two small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> with reversible neurologic defects, two episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>, and two episodes of severe allergic reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only three patients had significant groin <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> at home that required compression of the site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We subsequently did angioplasty on 323 patients, performed cardiac surgery (mostly coronary bypass) on 187 patients, and admitted 18.2% of the entire group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this procedure can be done safely in this carefully designed setting and it saves time and offers cost savings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patient selection is very important to minimize potential emergency situations and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The laboratory must be carefully set up and provide a close relationship with a hospital capable of attending to any unexpected emergency </plain></SENT>
