<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a 72-year-old-woman with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxoma</z:hpo> who suffered multiple cerebral mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After experiencing both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and a sudden collapse accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo>, she underwent cerebral computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, which revealed multiple cerebral mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of various dimensions and a large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath>, as a result of a previous haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolisation was performed in large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the circle of Willis but not in the one located in the periphery, and re-examination for a cardiac intervention a month later was indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of cerebral haemorrhage was considered high; thus she was not operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conservative treatment followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two years after the first diagnosis the patient remains healthy, suggesting that in such cases we should also consider conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the literature, the risk is high when <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are large, multiple and intractable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that cerebral CT or MRI scan should be performed before operation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxoma</z:hpo>, especially in those with left cardiac chamber localisation </plain></SENT>
