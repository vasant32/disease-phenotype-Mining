<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective review of data from the anesthesia and cardiothoracic surgery databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty-six patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of the right middle cerebral artery was performed after induction of general anesthesia through completion of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Doppler signals were recorded and emboli counts determined using an automated counting system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>Renal dysfunction</z:hpo> was assessed as the change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> from the preoperative value to the maximum postoperative value (Delta-Cr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant (p = 0.0003) univariate correlation between postoperative change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and total number of Doppler-detected emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of total number of emboli remained significant (p = 0.0038) in the multivariable analysis after adjustment for covariables (age, sex, number of grafts, left ventricular ejection fraction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, cardiopulmonary bypass time, preoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, and maximum postoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased numbers of Doppler-detected emboli during coronary artery bypass graft surgery are associated with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
