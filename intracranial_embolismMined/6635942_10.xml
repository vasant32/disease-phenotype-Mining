<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During a 7-year period, 818 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy (CE) and were evaluated for postoperative neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and eighteen had CE performed with a shunt; transient deficits occurred in 2.9% (nine patients) and permanent deficits occurred in 1.6% (five patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CE was performed without a shunt in 274 patients; transient deficits occurred in 2.9% (eight patients), while permanent deficits occurred in 2.2% (six patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CE was monitored by surveillance in 226 patients; transient deficits were found in 2.2% (five patients), while permanent deficits occurred in 1.6% (four patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative neurologic deficits between the groups (P greater than 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concept of inadequate collateral cerebral flow during endarterectomy could not, therefore, be indicted as the cause of the postoperative neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Technical errors that caused carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, and not inadequate collateral cerebral flow, accounted for most of the neurologic deficits after CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deficits occurred most frequently in neurologically unstable patients, those who were first seen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in evolution or with postreversible ischemic neurologic deficit and poststroke symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients awoke from CE with minor transient deficits, and neurologic function rapidly returned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with profound postoperative deficits had reoperations immediately; intracranial emboli were identified in three patients, while a thrombosed CE site was demonstrated in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three late (greater than 6 hours) postoperative deficits were due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the CE site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with minimal postoperative deficits will improve without intervention, but reoperation is mandatory if a major deficit occurs in the immediate postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A protocol for the management of the post-CE neurologic deficit is presented </plain></SENT>
