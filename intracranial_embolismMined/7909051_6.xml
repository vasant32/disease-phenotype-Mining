<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of the middle cerebral artery, short-duration high-intensity asymptomatic embolic signals were detected in 6 of 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and in 9 of 24 with prosthetic cardiac valves, but not in 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> the signals were usually unilateral and ipsilateral to the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals were significantly more common in patients with mechanical valves than with pig xenografts (8/13 vs 1/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With mechanical valves embolic signals were usually bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detection of asymptomatic emboli may allow identification of and preventive treatment in at-risk patients </plain></SENT>
