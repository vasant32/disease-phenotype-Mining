<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the workup of a patient with a known murmur and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms, paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> should be included in the differential </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, when an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is diagnosed acutely, ideal management includes thrombolytic therapy, but further research is needed to confirm that this is the correct management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to the risk of recurrence, postoperative thromboprophylaxis is recommended with or without closure of the foramen ovale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, and as demonstrated by the current patient, who partially recovered but did not require walking assistance after 2-year follow-up, treating physicians should be prepared to counsel patients through a lengthened physical rehabilitative process </plain></SENT>
