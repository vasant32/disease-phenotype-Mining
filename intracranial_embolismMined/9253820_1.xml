<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of frequency modulation in Doppler signals from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and to seek possible explanations for its occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Signals from 200 particulate emboli and 200 presumed gaseous emboli were studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Doppler signals were visualised in the time domain and were classified into three main types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type I signals contained no modulation, type II signals showed gradual frequency changes and type III showed a rapid change evident in only a small percentage of the entire signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type I signals were observed from 71.5% of particulate emboli but only 19% of gaseous emboli (X(2)) = 111, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type II signals were found in 28.5% of particulate emboli and 38% of gaseous emboli (X(2)) = 4.06, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most surprising and significant finding was that 43% of gaseous embolic signals were categorised as type III signals compared with 0% of signals from particulate emboli (X(2)) = 109, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding that known particulate emboli appear never to produce rapid frequency modulation may provide a basis for differentiating between gaseous and particulate emboli </plain></SENT>
