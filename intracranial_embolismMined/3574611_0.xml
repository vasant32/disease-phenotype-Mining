<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">Luminal</z:chebi> surface defects, characterized in scanning electron microscopy as endothelial discontinuities having diameters of 50 to 1500 microns, were a frequent finding, but their presence did not correlate well with the location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> seen on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Potential sources of emboli found were peels of subendothelial matrix, fibrin-platelet aggregates, fibrin-red blood cell clusters, and, possibly, damaged endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas of endothelial cell injury consisting of small denuded patches, sheets of endothelial cytoplasm, and distorted endothelial cell profiles were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These areas resembled the type of damage seen in experimental ischemic vessel lesions and were believed to be the result of carotid cross clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their presence suggests that a similar mechanism may result in loss of endothelial cells and exposure of the "raw" plaque surface in vivo </plain></SENT>
