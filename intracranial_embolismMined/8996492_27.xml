<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: By 1992, several prospective trials established the efficacy of anticoagulation (AC) and to some extent antiplatelet (AP) agents in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether practice patterns in AF <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylaxis reflect the findings of clinical trials and whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylaxis in AF differs between community hospitals and tertiary teaching hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospectively, 1250 hospital charts were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After patients who had undergone recent surgery, received treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, or were not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF on discharge were eliminated, 651 remaining records were analyzed for the presence of 26 clinical factors influencing the selection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze the association between clinical and demographic factors and the decision to treat with AC, AP, or no specific antiembolic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 651 patients in AF, 273 (42%) received noemboli prophylaxis while 219 (34%) were treated with AC (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>), 146 (22%) were treated with AP, and 13 (2%) received both agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients discharged in AF from community hospitals were significantly less likely to be treated with either AC or AP agents than patients discharged from tertiary centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A strong bias against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> prophylaxis with either AC or AP agents in AF existed with age over 45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression indicated that the decision to treat was associated only with the presence of prosthetic valve, history of prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0865573" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral disease</z:e>, and absence of a recent gastrointestinal bleed or occult blood in stool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even after adjustment for these factors, a significant bias against treatment with either AC or AP agents with advancing age and discharge from community hospitals remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> prophylaxis with either AC or AP agents is underutilized in the setting of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, factors known to increase the risk of embolization in AF such as age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> were not associated with decisions to treat with either AP or AC agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the use of clinical guidelines suggested by trials of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> prophylaxis in AF could reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
