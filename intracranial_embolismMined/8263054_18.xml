<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were to determine whether cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> occurs outside of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> produced by photothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, and also the direction of spreading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic infarction</z:e> was produced by irradiating the exposed skull of anesthetized rats with green light (560 nm) following systemic injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At proximal sites (approximately 2 mm anterior to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border), transient, severe hyperemic episodes (THEs) lasting 1-2 min were intermittently recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>THE frequency was greatest in the first hour and declined over a 3-h period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>THEs were accompanied (and usually preceded) by a precipitous rise in [K+]0 (from approximately 3 to &gt; 40 mM) and were associated with increases in local tissue oxygen tension (tPO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following the rise in [K+]0, clearance of [K+]0 to its pre-THE baseline preceded baseline recovery of CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that THEs were reactive to physiologic events resembling cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (CSD), which provoked increased demand for oxygen and blood flow, and which spread from proximal sites to areas more distal (approximately 4 mm) from the rim of the evolving <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MK-801 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) inhibited subsequent CSD-like episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that photothrombosis-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> provoked CSD which was triggered either within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core or in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rim and spread to more distal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether multiple episodes of CSD during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> generation are responsible for the remote consequences of focal brain injury remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
