<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the performance and safety of the FiberNet Embolic Protection System during carotid artery intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid Angioplasty and Stenting (CAS) can be proposed to treat the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain embolization takes place and routine use of Embolic Protection Devices (EPD) is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many EPDs have significant limitations, which may be addressed by a new EPD, the FiberNet (Lumen Biomedical, Plymouth, MN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The system consists of a 3-dimensional expandable filter made of fibers, which expand radially, mounted onto a 0.014'' wire and retrieval catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FiberNet can capture particles as small as 40 microm without compromising flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 35 lesions treated in 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male 67.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age: 71.4 +/- 8.8 (50-85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average stenosis 84.5% +/- 7.9 (70-99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>29.4% were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Technical success: 34/35 (97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neurological events: two permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amaurosis</z:e>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples visually contained significant amounts of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mean surface area of debris caught was 63.8 mm(2) (37.7-107.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made with other EPDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mean surface area of debris caught was 12.2 mm(2) (2.7-34.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No changes were noted in CT/MRI at 30-day post procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The first human use of this new novel EPD in carotid artery stenting is encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The FiberNet was easy to use and confirmed the ability to capture particles less than 100 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of the FiberNet has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Additional patients will demonstrate the overall safety and efficacy of this new EPD device </plain></SENT>
