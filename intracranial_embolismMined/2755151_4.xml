<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 51 years (range 10 to 76) and eight were under the age of 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 57 mitral, 33 aortic, and 10 tricuspid valve replacements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 9% of patients, 40% underwent multiple valve operations, and in 40% the procedure was a reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 26 months (range 12 to 49) and was 99% complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no examples of primary tissue failure, and only to reoperations have been undertaken for infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The early mortality rate was 8.2% and the late mortality rate, 12.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were valve related (two caused by infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and two by embolism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial 3-year survival rate was 70%, freedom from infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> 879%, freedom from embolism 87%, freedom from reoperation 90%, and freedom from valve-related complications 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but three surviving patients were in New York Heart Association class I or II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Doppler echocardiography, performed in 62 of 76 survivors, showed thin and mobile leaflets in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and trivial or mild regurgitation in four (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean gradient across the Medtronic Intact valves (Medtronic Blood Systems Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.) in the aortic position was 17 +/- 5.2 mm Hg, in the mitral position 3.8 +/- 1.33 mm Hg, and in the tricuspid position 4.1 +/- 1.14 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that early results with the Intact valve are encouraging </plain></SENT>
