<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By CT examination 19 cases were diagnosed hemorrhagic, 17 cases ischemic; while by syndrome differentiation of TCM 16 cases belonged to Zhongzangfu(middle internal organs), 20 cases Zhongjingluo (middle channels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the malondialdehyde generation by platelets was reduced, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> in poor platelet plasma increased in patients, compared with those in the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This finding was common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage and was not related to diagnostic classes by either CT examination or syndrome differentiation of TCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet function may have significant implication in the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
