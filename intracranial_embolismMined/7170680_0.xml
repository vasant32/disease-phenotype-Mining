<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight underwent cardiac catheterisation, and 46 (36% of the total) required surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 42 were under 20 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional cardiac lesions were noted in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> was encountered in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms or increasing evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> on the electrocardiogram were the principal indications for catheterisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional echocardiography is now important in this context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the 46 surgically treated patients; three of these were early and the fourth was a late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> three years after operation due to a massive cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> complicating infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 42 survivors of operation and the 82 unoperated patients have remained under long-term supervision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further surgery was necessary in 12 of the 42 surgically treated patients--valve replacement in seven of them two to eight years after valvotomy, replacement of a calcified xenograft valve in three, and repeat operation in two because of recurrence of subvalvar obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>Aortic stenosis</z:hpo> is not a benign condition in childhood and adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Close supervision is necessary and when any deterioration is detected further investigation as a prelude to probable surgery is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This should not be embarked on lightly in childhood unless there are pressing indications, particularly in view of the serious disadvantages of valve replacement in childhood </plain></SENT>
