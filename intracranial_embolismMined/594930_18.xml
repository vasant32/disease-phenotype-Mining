<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a striking reduction in the incidence of neurolocial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also a considerable reduction in the degree of impairment of intellectual function previously shown to develop after open-heart surgery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The measures taken and their rationale are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Psychometric testing is a useful method for evaluating the quality of cardiopulmonary bypass as it allows a quantitative assessment of postoperative cerebral function </plain></SENT>
