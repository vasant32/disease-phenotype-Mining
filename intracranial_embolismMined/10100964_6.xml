<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and fifty patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 24 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were prospectively studied with 3-step diagnoses: 1) symptomatic diagnosis based on the Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project criteria (OCSP), 2) radiological diagnosis (CT or MRI) and 3) etiological diagnosis based on the Lausanne <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most of the patients with symptoms of total anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (TACI), partial anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (PACI) and posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (POCI) had corresponding lesions on CT or MRI, while only 68% of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LACI) patients had small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> (SSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More than 60% of patients with TACI were classified into cardioembolism in the third diagnosis, while the etiology of PACI was either CE or large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LAA) in equal numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 58% of LACI patients were classified into small-artery disease (SAD) and 29% of them (30 cases) into LAA, of which 23 patients had lesions other than SSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of SAD in the combination of LACI and SSI was 0.78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The etiology of POCI was variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Except for LACI, the symptomatic classification by OCSP corresponds well to the radiological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The etiological diagnosis can be predicted by OCSP in TACI and PACI, but it is hard in POCI, and a number of LACI are due to LAA </plain></SENT>
