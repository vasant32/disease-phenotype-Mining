<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive patients (18 men; mean age 72 +/- 8 years) gave informed consent to undergo elective percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of the extracranial carotid artery protected by the TRAP VFS, a nitinol basket filter system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The TRAP VFS was delivered and retrieved safely in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; procedural success for carotid stenting was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 3 (9.7%) cases, the filters were positioned after lesion predilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nearly half (13, 41.9%) of the retrieved filters contained visible plaque debris that histology identified as cholesterol crystals, fibrin material, atheromatous plaque, and macrophage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no symptomatic major or minor neurological complications encountered in this cohort during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that percutaneous dilation and stenting of the carotid artery protected by TRAP VFS appears to be feasible, safe, and effective in preventing cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
