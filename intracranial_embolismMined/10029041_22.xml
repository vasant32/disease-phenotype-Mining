<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> (CFE) is a serious complication after fracture of long bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate of CFE may be high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, recent progress in treatment may decrease the mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the validity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and grade severity of CFE in 11 patients with CFE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score, PaO2, PaCO2 at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and minimal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and platelet levels were monitored, and phagocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain computed tomographic and MRI scans were performed serially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI findings were graded into four categories according to the severity of T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-intensity T2 signals were identified in the various brain regions as early as 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CFE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximum MRI grade significantly correlated with Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CFE (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High-intensity T2 signal lesions fused and enlarged with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In most cases, they diminished within 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients had persistent morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI-T2-weighted imaging seems to be the most sensitive imaging technique for diagnosing CFE, and correlates well with the clinical severity of brain Injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With the aid of proper treatment for pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath>, CFE is a potentially reversible disease that can have a good outcome </plain></SENT>
