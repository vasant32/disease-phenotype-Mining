<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Power maps, peak power frequency, and field power differences during both photic drive and verbal command were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings of one patient fit the criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Photic stimulation and event related desynchronization paradigm was used for testing the reactivity of EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Averaged EEG epochs during intended movement after verbal command showed significant alpha and sub-alpha power reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional differences of EEG reactivity were assumed secondary to the underlying hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Awareness of the patient in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in state</z:e> was documented by EEG analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second case <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">permanent vegetative state</z:e> was associated with a nonreactive rhythmic alpha pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Time sequence analysis of power ratios showed spontaneous alternating activity of alpha and sub-alpha generators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that pseudo-periodic fluctuation of alpha activity reflects partial preservation of thalamo-cortical connections </plain></SENT>
