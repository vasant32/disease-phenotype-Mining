<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our previous studies, we found that lumbrokinase, an extract from Korean earth worms, has a strong in vitro fibrinolytic effect without the presence of plasminogen and significant in vivo thrombolytic effects of lumbrokinase in a rat human-clot-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We established the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> model in rabbits by injecting a piece of human clot into the internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery and confirmed the occlusion with angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty one rabbits were divided into three groups and 5cc of saline, urokinase of 50,000 u/ml, and equipotent LK were injected intraarterially for 30 minutes into each group of 7 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes after the end of infusion, an angiogram was performed to confirm the recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clot lysis occurred in one, six, and one animals in the saline, urokinase and lumbrokinase treated groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to its in vitro effect, lumbrokinase is not as potent in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further investigation should be performed to determine the cause of its weakened in vivo effect and to develop a method to potentiate it </plain></SENT>
