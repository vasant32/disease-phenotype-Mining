<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods: Use of dosimetric and clinical data resulting from 84 diagnostic cerebral angiograms and 32 cerebral embolizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnostic angiography data were divided into three categories: A/ When a secondarily embolized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was diagnosed: n=17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B/ When the final diagnosis was an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>): n=10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C/ In the case where the diagnosis was neither <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to embolize: n=57 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral embolizations were classified in two sub-groups: K/ When the embolization immediately followed the diagnostic angiogram: n=15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>L/ When the embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> took place 24 to 48H after the angiography: n=17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean DAP of group B containing the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> is higher than mean DAP values in groups A and C, because of the increased cinegraphic time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is a strong correlation between the duration of the fluoroscopy and the DAP (n=116; r=0.931; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of runs in the group L contributes to the augmentation of the exposure time (significant difference in time: p=0.0054) and thus with the fact that DAP L&gt;DAPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Radiation dose during diagnostic cerebral angiography is increased in the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DAP of embolizations are higher when diagnostic and therapeutic phases are separated in time </plain></SENT>
