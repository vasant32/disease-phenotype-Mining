<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 2-year investigation covered five radiology and nine cardiology departments in public hospitals and private clinics, and focused on 12 examination types: 6 diagnostic and 6 interventional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,000 examinations was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information including the fluoroscopy time (T), the number of frames (N) and the dose-area product (DAP) was provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data set was used to establish the distributions of T, N and the DAP and the associated RL values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The examinations were pooled to improve the statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A wide variation in dose and image quality in fixed geometry was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As an example, the skin dose rate for abdominal examinations varied in the range of 10 to 45 mGy/min for comparable image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A wide variability was found for several types of examinations, mainly complex ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DAP RLs of 210, 125, 80, 240, 440 and 110 Gy cm2 were established for lower limb and iliac angiography, cerebral angiography, coronary angiography, biliary drainage and stenting, cerebral embolization and PTCA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The RL values established are compared to the data published in the literature </plain></SENT>
