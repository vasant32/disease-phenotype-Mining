<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unilateral proximal carotid occlusion (UCO) alone typically does not induce infarction in normotensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether UCO increases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after microembolic, experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Microembolic infarction was induced in 2 groups of Sprague-Dawley rats by injecting 2000 microspheres (50-micrometer diameter) intracranially from the external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The common carotid artery (CCA) was either ligated just after the injection (CCA occlusion group, n=8) or left intact (CCA open group, n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control group (n=4), vehicle without microspheres was injected and the CCA was ligated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, the brains were removed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted imaging was used to evaluate the cerebral circulation before and after CCA occlusion with and without microsphere injection in a separate group of animals (n=16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals in the microemboli groups survived and had only a slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> 24 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No neurological deficits were observed in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were 145+/-57 mm(3) in the CCA occlusion group and 45+/-26 mm(3) in the CCA open group (P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no infarctions detected in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-weighted imaging showed that cerebral blood flow decreased after the CCA occlusion in both experiments with and without the microsphere injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: UCO alone does not induce ischemic damage, but it worsens ischemic lesion size after multiple microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is probably due to the slight cerebral perfusion insufficiency caused by UCO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that patients with cerebral hemodynamic insufficiency, such as those with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, may have increased ischemic damage after microembolic events </plain></SENT>
