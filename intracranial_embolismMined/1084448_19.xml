<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The follow-up was 1,462 months (22.5 months per patient) for the first group and 1,411 months (24.7 months per patient) for the second group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of embolic accidents was significantly lower in the group taking aspirin: Thirteen thromboembolic accidents were detected in patients receiving the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and 3 in the group receiving the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> plus aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These figures represent a 20.3 per cent incidence (one each 9.3 years of treatment) for the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> group and a 5.2 per cent incidence (one accident each 39.1 years of treatment) for the other group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The statistical significance between groups is p less than 0.005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the hemorrhagic risk between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the use of an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> plus aspirin is a good and safe therapy for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
