<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight cases of host valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and 24 cases of prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> occurring during a concurrent period of time were analyzed to assess differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The over-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> incidence of prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> during this 40 month period was 4.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The symptoms and signs in both groups were similar, except that PVE patients had more frequent occurrences of changing heart murmurs and splenic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spleen scans may be helpful in the diagnosis of selected cases of culture-negative prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups for the various infecting microorganisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the culture-negative prosthetic valve group had a mortality rate of 77.7% compared to 46.2% for the host valve group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the HVE patients the oral cavity or urinary tract was the probable source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 50.0% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In about one third of HVE cases, there was strong evidence that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was related to a therapeutic procedure, whereas nearly half of the PVE patients had clinical evidence of an extracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> at the time of open-heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We emphasize the need for good pre- and postoperative surveillance to eliminate possible predisposing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with valvular disease at times of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The survival rate in patients with prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> was highest in those patients who received "appropriate" antibiotics and, if significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> was present, surgical intervention was necessary </plain></SENT>
