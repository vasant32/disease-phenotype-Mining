<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 30 to 80 years and averaged 62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">Ischaemic heart disease</z:e> was more commonly an aetiological factor than in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> atrioventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other aetiologies were familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, postcardiac surgery, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dystrophia myotonica</z:e>.Cardioversion before pacemaker insertion was a hazardous procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After insertion the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> and the need for drug therapy were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient no longer required a pacemaker once <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> became established.A high incidence of cerebral embolization was observed and the use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drugs therefore merits serious consideration.Failure of inhibition of demand-type pacemakers occurred in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients who exhibited competition with fixed-rate pacemakers died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients were treated with electrodes surgically implanted on the right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that fixed-rate pacemakers may be contra-indicated and that sequential atrioventricular demand pacing is theoretically ideal </plain></SENT>
