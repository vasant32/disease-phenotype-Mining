<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed bilateral vertebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> to be complicated by a persistent primitive proatlantal artery which had become an important collateral circulation pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the patient was hospitalized because of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>sensory impairment</z:hpo>, he also developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001133'>visual field constriction</z:hpo> and cerebellar symptoms due to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> despite anticoagulation treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of various examinations, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, probably caused by stenosis at the origin of the persistent proatlantal artery, was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery stenting for the stenosis was planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A filter protection device was found to be very useful for stenting with maintenance of blood flow in the persistent primitive proatlantal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There have been no reports of stenting in persistent primitive proatlantal arteries, such as that our present case is considers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It provides valuable information on the management of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
