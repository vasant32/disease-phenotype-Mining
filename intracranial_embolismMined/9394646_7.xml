<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 16 divers with dysbaric injuries were examined after the initiation of therapeutic recompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their injuries comprised: neurological <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> II n = 8; AGE n = 7; combined cerebral-AGE/spinal-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> n = 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained in 2 planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the spinal cord was imaged in 7 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The imaging findings were correlated with the neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of the head showed ischemic cerebrovascular lesions in 6/8 patients with AGE but showed focal hyperintensities in only 2/8 divers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spinal cord involvement was detected in 1/7 examinations, which was the combined cerebral-AGE/spinal-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was agreement between the locations of the documented lesions and the clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> readily detects cerebral damage in AGE but yields low sensitivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> investigation cannot rule out AGE or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> is useful in the examination of patients with decompression illness </plain></SENT>
