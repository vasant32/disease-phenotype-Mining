<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method has previously been hampered by (1) lack of selective arterial injection of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, (2) disruption of local hemodynamic relationships by ligation of major arterial channels, (3) excessive volume of the air <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, and (4) uncontrolled bubble size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To minimize these factors, a technique was devised in the rat whereby a fine catheter was advanced through a branch of the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Air emboli of 5 microliters were found to arrest blood flow and to attenuate electrical activity in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere for seconds to a couple of minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> varied from region to region, and it tended to be prolonged by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>arterial hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the nonembolized hemisphere, CBF never declined abruptly (indicating no cross-over of air) although electrical activity was suppressed in two-thirds of the animals </plain></SENT>
