<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the molecular structure of tight junctional complexes in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> has been identified, little is known about alterations of tight junctional proteins after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated alterations of tight junctional proteins, i.e., occludin and zonula occludens (ZO)-1, in isolated rat brain capillaries after microsphere-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the levels of occludin and ZO-1 had decreased after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The embolism also resulted in a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin, which was coincident with an increase in the activity of c-Src </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a decrease in the levels of occludin and ZO-1, and an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin may play an important role in the disruption of tight junctions, which may lead to dysfunction of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
