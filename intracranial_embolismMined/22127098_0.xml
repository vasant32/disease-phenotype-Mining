<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between the number of high intensity transient signals (HITS) by transcranial doppler ultrasound and the extent of atherosclerotic plaques in aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were treated as a part of a single center United States Food and Drug Administration-approved investigational device exemption for various thoracic aortic pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral transcranial doppler ultrasound transducers recorded the number of HITS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT angiography and intravascular ultrasound were used to measure the thickness of mural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and determine their arch location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 patients had detectable HITS, and one patient sustained a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest HITS were observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in zones 2 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients with bovine arch had more HITS in the right middle cerebral artery whereas the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arch <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> had more HITS in the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to characterize the significance of mural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in aortic arch and their relationship to embolic events during aortic arch manipulations </plain></SENT>
