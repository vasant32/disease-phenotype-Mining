<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo>, the determination of the transstenotic pressure gradient is usually performed by cardiac catheterization with retrograde passage of the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine retrospectively the risk of the invasive examination with retrograde catheterization of the left ventricle and predictors for an increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 1984 to 1995, 457 patients (63 +/- 11 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> were investigated in the Medizinische Klinik TÃ¼bingen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 435 patients (95.2%), the retrograde catheterization of the left ventricle was successful; in 19 cases a transseptal left heart catheterization was performed, and in 3 patients an invasive determination of the pressure gradient was not assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 39 patients (8.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 patients died due to the catherization procedure (mortality rate 1.1%), 2 of them as a consequence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the left ventricle, one patient of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, one of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and another of fulminant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four procedures (0.9%) were complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, in 3 patients a pericard tamponade occurred, and in one case caused by transseptal punction of the interatrial septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most complications were peripheral vascular problems in 19 patients (4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predictors for increased risk dur to retrograde catheterization were age &gt; 70 years (p = 0.008) and aortic valve area &lt; or = 0.7 cm2 (p = 0.02). patients with a doppler echocardiographic instantaneous pressure gradient &gt; or = 70 mm Hg were more likely to sustain a complication (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The retrograde catheterization of a stenotic aortic valve was successful in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In approximately 2% of patients, complications occurred which can be attributed directly to retrograde catheterization and with significant higher frequency in patients over 70 years and with severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Especially in these cases, invasive determination of the gradient should not be performed if reliable doppler echocardiographic information is available </plain></SENT>
