<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To describe MRI and MRA features in CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical and neuroradiological studies of 20 patients with proven CVT were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent computed tomography (CT), MRI (with MRA for 15 patients) and digital substraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had follow-up after treatment with MRI (nine with MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MRI and MRA together provided the diagnosis of CVT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of MRI alone was 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRA showed abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progressive sinus recanalization was demonstrated by follow-up with MRI and MRA at least 15 days after diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In most of cases, the combination of MRI and MRA is sufficient to allow diagnosis of CVT and obviates the need for invasive angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies are also useful for the follow-up of CVT </plain></SENT>
