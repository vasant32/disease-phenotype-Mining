<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six showed significant reactivity within a few days after the relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It decreased or disappeared during the 2 weeks after the relapse, but sometimes reappeared and was found in tests performed 2-3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were studied in a similar way--in three, marked reactivity was noted within a few days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; in these, reactivity decreased or disappeared in later tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the two other patients, reactivity appeared in the second and/or third test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possibility of a reactivity as in epiphenomenon due to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> tissue destruction is discussed, and the need for antigens with a more restricted specificity for such an analysis is stressed </plain></SENT>
