<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the effectiveness of five basic cerebral protection devices designed for carotid angioplasty in an in-vitro bench-top model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simulation of embolization from carotid angioplasty (n = 180) was performed with polyvinyl alcohol (<z:chebi fb="10" ids="53706">PVA</z:chebi>) particles (Contour; 150-1,000- micro m) in an open flow model simulating the aortic arch with a carotid bifurcation made from elastic <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Particles (150-250 micro m [small], 355-500 micro m [medium], 710-1,000 micro m [large]; 5 mg each) were injected separately into the internal carotid artery (ICA) proximal to the placed protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five devices were tested: the Angioguard (AG), Filter Wire EX (EX(A), EX(B)), Trap, Neuroshield (NS), and GuardWire Plus (GW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Particles getting past the protection device or flowing into the external carotid artery (ECA) were caught in a filter at the end of both arteries and their weight was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For small, medium, and large particles, the lowest weight of emboli in the effluent of the ICA was obtained with the NS (0.28 mg, 0.18 mg, and 0.07 mg, respectively; P &lt;.001 compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other devices except the GW for small particles only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GW had the highest embolization rate into the ECA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> particle sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When combining the particle weights for the different protection devices, the NS showed the lowest weight of emboli into the ICA filter (0.53 mg/3.5%; P &lt;.001 compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> [&gt;1.1 mg/7.0%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The GW revealed the highest weight of emboli into the ECA (1.2 mg/7.6%; P &lt;.001 compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> [&lt;0.59 mg/0.09%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness of the EX(B) device was enhanced when circumferentially deployed under direct view (EX(B), 0.39 mg/2.58%; EX(A), 1.18 mg/7.81%; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In vitro, none of the tested devices or modifications has the ability to prevent embolization completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An occlusion balloon leads to increased embolization into the ECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of the EX might be enhanced with design improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During this evaluation, the NS was most effective for preventing <z:chebi fb="10" ids="53706">PVA</z:chebi> particle embolization of the three different particle groups within this in-vitro model </plain></SENT>
