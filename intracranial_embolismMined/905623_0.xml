<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the third group a "paradoxical" increase in blood flow was observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and a decrease proportional to the rest of the brain in limited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> which had subsequently regressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The "Althesin test" proposed by Rasmussen (1975) thus reveals the existence of a disconnection between blood flow and metabolism within cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and provides a possible means of differentiating the latter from reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemias</z:e> </plain></SENT>
