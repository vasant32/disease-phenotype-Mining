<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of transcranial Doppler monitoring in reducing the complications of carotid endarterectomy, by analysing: (1) perioperative intracerebral blood flow velocity; (2) embolic load; and (3) effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran-40</z:chebi> therapy on patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 30 consecutive patients undergoing 32 carotid endarterectomy procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was performed to obtain flow velocities and embolic count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow velocity changes were analysed in relation to electroencephalographic (EEG) changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran-40</z:chebi> infusion was instituted for patients who experienced a post-arteriotomy embolic load of &gt;50 counts/hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAvel) drop on cross clamping was 46+/-12.1%, expressed as a percentage of the individual's 24-hour pre-operative value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clamping <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> developed in six cases (18.8%) of which three (9.4%) demonstrated TCD changes only, and three demonstrated both TCD and EEG changes (9.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average increase in MCAvel at 60-120 minutes postarteriotomy, was 18+/-17.5%; six cases developed hyperaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative emboli were seen in 88% of cases with 31% of patients demonstrating embolic loads of &gt;50/hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative transcranial Doppler monitoring (1) is a useful adjunct to EEG assessment of cross clamping <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, providing information in real time, on <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood velocity deterioration that may antecede irreversible change (2) detects postoperative hyperaemic response, and (3) allows quantification of microembolic loads that, when high, have been shown to be a precursor to localised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> and can be effectively treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran-40</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
