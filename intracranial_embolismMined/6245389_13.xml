<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three specimens showed lesions in the brainstem and bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the inferior olivary nuclei; the fourth revealed unilateral olivary changes caused by an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the contralateral dentate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After incubation for acetylcholinesterase, neuropilar and capillary wall staining were absent or much reduced, but there was increased denisty of reaction product in the neuronal cell bodies and in numerous tortuous dendrites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods for acid phosphatase showed strong activity in the dendrites and glomeruloid structures of the diseased olives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reactions for nonspecific esterase indicated dendritic expansion and reduced staining density in nerve cell bodies, but augmented glial reactivity </plain></SENT>
