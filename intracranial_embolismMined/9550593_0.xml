<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two patients with embolic (cardiac or artery-to-artery) and 107 with non-embolic (thrombotic or hemodynamic) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were diagnosed on strict cerebral angiographic criteria alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clearly discriminate between these two groups, the neurological and computed tomographic (CT) findings were then compared </plain></SENT>
