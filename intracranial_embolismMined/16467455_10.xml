<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and immunohistochemical studies revealed that expression of calpastatin, an endogenous calpain inhibitor, decreased after ME induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calpain activation after ME was apparently due to, in part, a decrease in calpastatin in a late phase of neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time course of that decrease also paralleled caspase-3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies demonstrated that calpastatin was degraded by caspase-3 in a Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because CaM binds directly to calpastatin, we asked whether a novel CaM <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, 3-[2-[4-(3-chloro-2-methylphenylmethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-5,6-dimethoxy-1-(4-imidazolylmethyl)-1H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36669,36671">indazole</z:chebi> dihydro-<z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> 3.5 hydrate (DY-9760e), inhibits caspase-3-induced calpastatin degradation during ME-induced neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also tested the effect of DY-9760e on degradation of fodrin, a calpain substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our hypothesis, DY-9760e (25 or 50 mg/kg i.p.) treatment inhibited degradation of calpastatin and fodrin in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because DY-9760e showed powerful neuroprotective activity with concomitant inhibition of calpastatin degradation, cross-talk between calpain and caspase-3 through calpastatin possibly accounts for ME-induced neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, both inhibition of caspase-3-induced calpastatin degradation and calpain-induced fodrin breakdown by DY-9760e in part mediate its neuroprotective action </plain></SENT>
