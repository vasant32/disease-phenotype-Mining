<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We described two cases and investigated the mechanism of the territory of the AChA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case 1 was a 69-year-old man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 2 was a 71-year-old woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurological examination in both cases showed left homonymous hemianopsia, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo>, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and left hemisensory disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT scan in these cases showed infarctions of the right uncus, amygdaloid nucleus, genu and posterior limb of the internal capsule, globus pallidus, lateral geniculate body and tail of the caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The right common carotid angiogram showed a complete occlusion of the ICA at its cervical segment in case 1 and at its carotid siphon in case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the left carotid injection visualized the right anterior cerebral artery and right middle cerebral artery via the anterior communicating artery well, but the right AChA was not visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In case 1, the collateral pathways from the right external carotid artery (ECA) and the right posterior communicating artery (PCoA) to the right ICA were not supplied and the precommunicating segment of the right posterior cerebral artery was hypoplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In case 2, the collateral pathway from the right ECA to the right ICA was not supplied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
