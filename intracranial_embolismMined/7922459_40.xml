<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This loss contrasts with the preservation of a wide set of complex notions that the patient exploits in order to overcome his deficit and get the right result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This observation helps in isolating and describing an important component of arithmetical long-term memory that is not overlearnt and the functioning of which is not automatic or mechanistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An account of such a component is lacking in models of arithmetic currently referred to in cognitive neuropsychology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a remediation study, performed over several weeks, the effect of training was selective for each single arithmetical fact: not even skills with multiplication complements (e.g. 6 x 3, 3 x 6) fully benefited from the rehabilitation of a specific fact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the storage format of each fact is independent from that of other facts </plain></SENT>
