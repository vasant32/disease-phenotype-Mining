<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until recently, there has been no consensus on the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in patients with nonrheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and the role of aspirin has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since 1989, 5 randomized, controlled trials have been published comparing <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> or aspirin with placebo for primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with nonrheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these trials have shown a clear benefit of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy (risk reduction 35 to 86%), whereas the benefit of aspirin has been less obvious (risk reduction 15 to 42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these studies, anticoagulation level was moderate (INR 1.5 to 3.0), and the rate of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was reported to be low (0.8 to 2.5% per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy does not seem to be warranted in patients &lt; 60 years old with lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and the decision should be individualized in patients &gt; 75 years old in whom the risk of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these situations, aspirin (325 mg per day) appears to be a safe and reasonable alternative </plain></SENT>
