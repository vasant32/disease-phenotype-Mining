<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A randomised clinical trial sought evidence as to whether leucocyte-depleting (LD) arterial line filters added a further degree of neuroprotection in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and ninety-two patients were randomised to the use of a Pall Leukoguard-6 LD filter or either an Avecor Affinity or Pall Autovent-6 control filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli during surgery were recorded by transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitor over the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence of cerebral impairment was obtained by comparing patients' performance in a neuropsychological (NP) test battery (nine tests) administered 6-8 weeks post-operatively with their pre-operative scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The groups proved well balanced in pre-operative variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) the median number and range of microemboli was 15 (3-180) in the LD group compared to 67 (5-846) and 55 (2-773) for the Avecor and AV6 groups, respectively (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixty-two patients completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the NP tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LD group showed better post-operative performance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the nine tests although the difference in a total change score just failed to reach significance (P=0.07 one-tailed t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LD filtration during CABG reduced the number of cerebral microemboli recorded by TCD and showed a strong trend towards improving NP performance post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the use of such filters in CABG surgery may offer increased neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
