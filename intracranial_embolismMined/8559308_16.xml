<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is strong evidence indicating hemodynamic stress as an underlying cause for saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> growth, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and/or rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined flow fields encountered in models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> having a lateral (originating from the side of an artery, not at a branch point) geometric configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Shear stress and pressure gradients acting on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> walls under a variety of flow and geometric conditions were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, a two-dimensional finite-element computer model of lateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in a steady-flow state was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three idealized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> shapes were studied, half-spherical, spherical, and pear-shaped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ostium width of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo>, relative to the radius of the parent artery and the Reynolds number, were also varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal shear stresses and maximum pressures (for an ostium width of 2 times the radius of the parent artery) were typically found at the downstream site of the ostium, rather than at the dome of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, the highest shear stresses and the lowest pressures (at the distal portion of the ostium) were obtained in the spherical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, whereas the lowest shear stresses and the highest pressures were found in the half-spherical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The location of maximal stresses (shear and pressure) at the distal region of the ostium suggests that growth and/or rupture may well proceed from this point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such findings are in contrast to the commonly held opinion that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture occurs at the dome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Careful pathological investigation will need to be performed to clarify this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of this preliminary investigation also indicate that the flow field in lateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is highly dependent on a number of factors related to flow and geometric parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Geometry seems to be a significant mediator of local magnitudes of stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, the tendency for growth or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may be influenced by variations in size or shape </plain></SENT>
