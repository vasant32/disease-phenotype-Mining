<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether the type of AF and prestroke treatment with an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> were associated with physical disabilities in patients with AF-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 162 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with AF who were admitted to our hospital over a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disability was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at the time of discharge and was categorized according to favorable clinical outcome (mRS score 0-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 162 patients, 71 (43.8%) had paroxysmal AF and 91 had permanent AF </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 103 patients (63.6%) had a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that paroxysmal AF (odds ratio [OR], 1.58; P = .0187), prestroke anticoagulation treatment (OR, 1.95; P = .0019), and noncardiogenic embolism (OR, 2.20; P = .0073) were independent factors associated with a favorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that paroxysmal AF and prestroke anticoagulation treatment are independently associated with favorable clinical outcome at the time of hospital discharge in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
