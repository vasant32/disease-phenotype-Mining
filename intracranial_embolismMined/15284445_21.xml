<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcatheter closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) is increasingly being performed and monitored with transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography, whereas contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler (ce-TCD), which probably represents the most suitable tool to quantify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) in the brain vessels, has been systematically overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal is to prospectively assess efficacy and safety of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> transcatheter closure using ce-TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 140 consecutive patients (mean age, 46+/-13 years; male/female ratio, 63/77) with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>-related large RLS and no other recognized cause of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> underwent transcatheter closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD was done preoperatively and 1 month after the procedure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, after 3 months in 120, after 6 months in 112, and after 1 year in 104 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Implantation was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During Valsalva strain, a large shunt was still detectable in 31 of 140 (22%), 15 of 120 (13%), 9 of 112 (8%), and 9 of 104 (9%) patients at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month visits, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural and postprocedural complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in 8% and scintillating scotomata in 6% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 1-year follow-up period, only 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> was recorded in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and complete <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure in patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and large RLS may be less successful than reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD appears the ideal tool to follow up the closure process and to identify early, during follow-up, those patients who will be left with a significant shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is more common than believed previously and may underlie the occurrence of further cerebrovascular events despite complete <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Irritative visual phenomena may occur as a consequence of <z:chebi fb="152" ids="28112">nickel</z:chebi> toxicity </plain></SENT>
