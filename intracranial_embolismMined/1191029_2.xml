<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a series of 20 cases of cardiac injury, ten cases were indicative of such subtle symptoms, several of which were life-threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These unusual manifestations can be categorized as early, intermediate, or late </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early problems of four patients included the following: (1) sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of shock during laparotomy, performed due to apparent abdominal trauma; (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> on arrival in the emergency room; and (3) cerebral air <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and mimicked symptoms of possible irreversible anoxic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intermediate manifestations of cardiac injury are usually discovered in the early recovery period, and include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> with cardiogenic shock and bullet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> to a peripheral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intermediate manifestations were observed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had late complications that included pseudoaneurysm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, valvular damage, and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001701'>pericarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These late complications were observed between one month and 21 years after cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
