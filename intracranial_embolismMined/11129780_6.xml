<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is capable of detecting the water shifts from extracellular to intracellular space associated with SD waves and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and can make in vivo measurements of these two features on a pixel-by-pixel basis with good temporal resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using continuous high speed DWI with a temporal resolution of 12 seconds over a period of 3 hours, the in vivo contribution of spontaneous SDs to the development of ischemic tissue injury was examined in 8 rats using a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the observation period, the initial lesion volume increased in 4 animals, remained unchanged in 1 animal, and decreased in 3 animals (most likely because of spontaneous clot lysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of the lesion evolution patterns, animals demonstrated 6.5 +/- 2.1 spontaneous SDs outside of the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A time-to-peak analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) changes for each SD wave demonstrated multidirectional propagation patterns from variable initiation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maps of the time constants of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> recovery, reflecting the local energy supply and cerebral blood flow, revealed prolonged recovery times in areas close to the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, repetitive SD episodes in the periinfarct tissue did not eventually lead to permanent <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that spontaneous SD waves do not necessarily contribute to the expansion of the ischemic lesion volume in this model </plain></SENT>
