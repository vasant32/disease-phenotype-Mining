<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain pathology was studied in 18 Wistar rats following carotid artery irradiation with a red laser (632 nm) at powers ranging from 100 to 800 mW/cm2 for 10 or 20 minutes following the injection of the photosensitizing dye Photofrin II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple cerebral arterioles were occluded by platelet aggregates containing frequent erythrocytes and leukocytes, identical to the thrombotic material in the carotid artery but different from the platelet aggregates seen in the carotid artery and the brain in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were distributed randomly throughout the brain ipsilateral to the nonocclusive carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant heating (0.5 degree C or more) of the blood occurred only with laser powers higher (1,600 mW/cm2) or laser irradiations longer (25 minutes) than those used in the improved model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This model mimics one mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in humans and provides a means to study systematically the morphological evolution of small cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
