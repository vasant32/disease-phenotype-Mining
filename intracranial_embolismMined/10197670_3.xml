<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients, mean age 68 +/- 6 years (range, 55 to 77 years), with grade IV + V plaques of the ascending aorta and transverse arch underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 21) and aortic valve replacement (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular emboli from unknown sources were found preoperatively in 8 patients (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete thromboendarterectomy of the ascending aorta and transverse arch was performed during hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 21 +/- 12 months (range, 4 to 44 months), magnetic resonance imaging and transthoracic echocardiography of endarterectomized vessels was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (4.5%), one early (4.5%), and one late (4.7%) adverse neurologic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up examinations revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diameters of the endarterectomized aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with grade IV + V plaques, thromboendarterectomy of the ascending aorta and transverse arch can be performed with an acceptable surgical risk and a low recurrence rate for cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>Dilatation</z:mpath> of the endarterectomized aorta was not observed </plain></SENT>
