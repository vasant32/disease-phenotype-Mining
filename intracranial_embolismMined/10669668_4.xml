<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University-based, tertiary referral medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Forty-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nonrheumatic AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studied patients underwent both a baseline and follow-up TEE during a mean period of 13 +/- 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements and results: Baseline TEE revealed that LA spontaneous echo contrast was present in 28 patients (group 1) and was absent in 19 patients (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LA appendage flow velocity profiles at baseline were significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2; on follow-up, the appendage flow velocities decreased significantly in group 2, but were not significantly changed in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up TEE revealed that spontaneous echo contrast was persistent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> group 1 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group 2, LA spontaneous echo contrast was newly observed in 9 patients (group 2A) but was persistently absent in 10 patients (group 2B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group 2A, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the LA appendage flow velocity profiles decreased significantly at the follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group 2B, however, only LA appendage inflow velocity integral showed significant decrease on follow-up; there were no significant changes in LA appendage outflow velocity indexes and peak inflow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LA appendage flow velocity may decrease with time in some patients with AF, and this change is associated with a new occurrence of LA spontaneous echo contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For patients without LA spontaneous echo contrast, serial follow-up of the LA appendage flow velocity profiles may be useful for predicting future development of spontaneous echo contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Once LA spontaneous echo contrast occurs in AF patients, it tends to persist with time and the LA appendage is usually under a persistently low flow state </plain></SENT>
