<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate development of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six patients were assessed the day before surgery and 48 h and 12 months after surgery using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive performance was compared with a matched control group to account for the practise effect associated with repeated testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasonography was used to detect intraoperative cerebral microembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>S100beta protein values were evaluated before and immediately after anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the second postoperative day, 26.9% of patients undergoing neck dissection had postoperative neurocognitive deficit (POCD), defined as a total deficit score of 2SD worse than the mean performance in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were found only in the neck dissection group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>S100beta levels were significantly higher after neck dissection (Wilcoxon signed ranked test: P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 12 months, the incidence of POCD was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: POCD was detectable only after neck dissection in the early postoperative period accompanied by increased incidence of microembolism and protein S100beta levels, but not 12 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
