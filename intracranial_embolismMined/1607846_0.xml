<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We presented examples of both supraventricular and ventricular rhythm disorders which can occur in athletic individuals, even presidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of rhythm problems we deal with in athletes are fortunately benign, entities such as frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial ectopic beats</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each patient encountered, we ask ourselves the five questions noted in the discussion pertaining to symptomatology, anatomic source of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, presence or absence of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, and precipitating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common more sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVTs</z:e> we see are AVNRT and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>Atrial flutter</z:hpo> is less common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These are more of a nuisance to patients rather than a threat to their lives, although rarely cerebral embolic events can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapy includes avoidance of precipitating factors and, when necessary, a sequential trial of available drugs, carefully documenting the response and watching closely for any pro-arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We infrequently see NSVT in athletes, even triplets of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> on exercise testing, and rarely see instances of sustained VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter merits a careful search for underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> and usually electrophysiology-guided drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New techniques such as radiofrequency ablation of the dysrhythmic focus may obviate the need for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> drug therapy in selected cases </plain></SENT>
