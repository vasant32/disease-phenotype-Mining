<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral embolism</z:e> is the most serious risk of CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery stenting is still not reimbursed and unauthorised not authorised in routine in France (excepted in trials with ethical committee approval) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CAS is now feasible, with a high technical success, which may improves with learning curve and with a better patient selection of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of higher risk situations for CEA represents ideal indications for CAS, such as restenosis after CEA, stenosis due to prior neck radiation and radical neck surgery, and lesions in the distal internal carotid artery or involving high, retromandibular bifurcation </plain></SENT>
