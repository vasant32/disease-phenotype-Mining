<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we present here two patients whose cases may serve as a warning about an unusual complication associated with these stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We encountered this complication after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography for obstructed metal biliary stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first patient, an 87-year-old man with a benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0597984" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">biliary stricture</z:e>, failed to regain consciousness after clearing of his stent using a Dormia basket and balloon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> was diagnosed on cerebral computed tomography, and transesophageal echocardiography revealed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> as a precipitating factor for paradoxical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He survived and was discharged with a residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second patient, a 54-year-old man who had a history of a Billroth II operation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo> and who had a portal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cavernoma</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">biliary obstruction</z:e> due to collateral veins, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340861" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EMD">electromechanical dissociation</z:e> complicated the balloon-catheter stent revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography performed during cardiopulmonary resuscitation showed major <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> to the right heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These cases demonstrate that air may gain access to the venous system during therapeutic endoscopic procedures of this type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the large diameter of metal stents and the potential for these stents to lacerate venous structures facilitate the entry of air into the venous circulation, an event which may have life-threatening consequences </plain></SENT>
