<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 118 consecutive patients, duplex scanning performed immediately before anaesthesia was used to confirm that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> had not progressed to occlusion since the arteriogram </plain></SENT>
