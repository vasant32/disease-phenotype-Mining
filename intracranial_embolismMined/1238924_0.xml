<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> arising from the anterior communicating artery, 24 X 28 X 30 mm in diameter was found in a 30 year old man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About ten years ago he became blind and recently developed right <z:hpo ids='HP_0000458'>anosmia</z:hpo> and diencephalic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, however, was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiograms and tomograms of the cranium showed a ring-like calcification, but by angiography it couldn't be recognized as a giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The right frontal craniotomy and partial resection, therefore, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A histological study of the resected material revealed that it was a spontaneously thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inner layer of its wall had neither endothelium nor elastic lamina, but had deposits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35156">calcium salt</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The outer layer was composed of collagen fibers without cell infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was thrombosed except for its neck but its organization occurred incompletely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We want to emphasize the importance of a correct preoperative diagnosis, as an erroneous operative procedure can result in disaster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Volume, viscosity and tension of flowing blood into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> as well as the size of its neck and dome regulate dynamic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These properties may determine the enlargement rate or growth of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The dynamic characteristics and features of the inner surface of the aneurysmal wall may regulate the formation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The intraluminal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and strength of aneurysmal wall, for example, calcium deposits, may prohibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> from its rupture </plain></SENT>
