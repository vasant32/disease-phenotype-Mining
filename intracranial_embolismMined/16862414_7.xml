<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During interventional neuroradiology procedures, patients can be exposed to moderate to high levels of radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Special considerations are required to protect children, who are generally more sensitive to the short- and long-term detrimental effects of radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Estimates of dose to the skin of children from certain interventional procedures have been published elsewhere, but we are not aware of data on dose to the brain or on the long-term risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> from brain radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our goals were to estimate radiation doses to the brain in 50 pediatric patients who had undergone cerebral embolization and to assess their lifetime risks of developing radiation-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Entrance-peak skin dose and various assumptions on conditions of exposure were used as input for dosimetric calculations to estimate the spatial pattern of dose within the brain and the average dose to the whole brain for each child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average dose and the age of the child at time of exposure were used to estimate the lifetime risk of developing radiation-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 50 patients, average radiation doses to the brain were estimated to vary from 100 mGy to 1,300 mGy if exposed to non-collimated fields and from 20 mGy to 160 mGy for collimated, moving fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lifetime risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain cancer</z:e> was estimated to be increased by 2% to 80% as a result of the exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the very small lifetime background risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp>, the excess number of cases will be small even though the relative increase might be as high as 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ALARA principles of collimation and dose optimization are the most effective means to minimize the risk of future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751366" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">radiation-related cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
