<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -Twelve dogs underwent selective catheterization of the internal carotid or vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Either a microbubbled mixture of air (1.0 - 4.0 mL), blood, contrast and saline (n = 5), or heat-dried pulverized blood (particle size &lt; 600 Î¼m) mixed with saline and contrast (n = 6) was injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One sham control experiment was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI scans were performed pre-injection, and at 1, 2, and 4 days post-injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological tests were performed daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gross pathology and histopathology were performed on the brains after the day 4 sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three animals died &lt;24 hours after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hyperintense lesions were observed on DWI (median maximum diameter 3.1 mm) in 2 of 4 animals after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> and in 3 of 5 animals after particulate embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No DWI lesions were detected in the remaining 5 animals (including the sham control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lesions seen on DWI and confirmed on the FLAIR (fluid attenuating inversion recovery) sequence correlated well with anatomical lesions on histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -Cerebral embolization of air microbubbles or micro-particulate debris that approximate the embolic sources from catheter ablation can create hyperintense DWI punctate lesions in a canine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The location and size of the DWI/FLAIR lesions correlate with pathological findings </plain></SENT>
