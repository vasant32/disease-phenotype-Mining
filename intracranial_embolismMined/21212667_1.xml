<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, prospective study, pre- and postangiographic diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) of 184 participants was evaluated for the occurrence of silent embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant relationship was found between the patients receiving abciximab before digital subtraction angiography (15 of 90; 16.7%) and patients in the placebo group (16 of 94; 17.0%) regarding postangiographic appearance of silent emboli (p = 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IIb/IIIa receptor inhibition by abciximab does not diminish the occurrence of silent embolism during digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that solid blood clots are not the origin of hyperintense lesions observed on DWI and enhance the role of alternative mechanisms </plain></SENT>
