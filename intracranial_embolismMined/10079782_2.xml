<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To emphasize the role of noninvasive diagnostic investigative methods and their importance in early detection of mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> related to staphylococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and of monitoring therapy or identifying complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two patients with mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> that developed as complications of staphylococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first patient had mesenteric artery mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and presented with sudden rupture one month after initial diagnosis of mitral valve infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and completion of a full course of antimicrobial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second patient had multiple cerebral mycotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333101" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microaneurysms</z:e> and presented with hemorrhagic cerebral embolization from aortic valve infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The first patient died because of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> 48 h after rupture of the mesenteric artery mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011854'>hemoperitoneum</z:hpo>, which was treated surgically with distal ileal resection and ileostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient was alive two years after prolonged antimicrobial therapy and aortic replacement to treat moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and progressive left ventricular enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is a rare complication of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> but has a high mortality rate because of its early or late potential catastrophic rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis by noninvasive diagnostic imaging techniques of mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> before rupture would be beneficial for its treatment </plain></SENT>
