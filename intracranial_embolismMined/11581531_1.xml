<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improved surgical techniques and perioperative care have reduced the mortality and morbidity of many organ transplant procedures to acceptable levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The creation of national and international organ registries has resulted in a more efficient system for organ procurement and use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Advances in immunology and the introduction of more potent immunomodulating agents have led to doubling of survival rates for those with transplanted grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, a high rate of neurologic complications associated with organ transplantation persists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral embolization, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> remain frequent after heart and lung transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> associated with bone marrow transplantation still leads to catastrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> following bone marrow transplantation has been reduced by the use of growth factors, and the routine use of potent prophylactic antibiotic and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22587">antiviral agents</z:chebi> has reduced the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, unusual or resistant central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> continues to arise, often creating difficult treatment choices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the more effective classes of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> may have direct toxic effects on the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major challenge for the future is to develop agents and strategies for management that can effect selective tolerance to the donated organ without paralyzing the immune system's ability to fight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such agents must also have limited or no toxicity to the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> and other organ systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The observations by Starzl on the existence of leukocyte chimerism years after transplantation suggest that understanding and building on this natural phenomenon may hold promise for solving major problems in the field of organ transplantation </plain></SENT>
