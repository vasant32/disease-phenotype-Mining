<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intense thrombogenicity was observed with the <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">Teflon</z:chebi>-coated guidewires with formed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> ranging in size from 50-100 microns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No formed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was noted on any of the specimens of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> guidewire, although isolated clumps of platelets and erythrocytes without fibrin strands were seen infrequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> guidewire is markedly less thrombogenic than <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">Teflon</z:chebi>-coated guidewires </plain></SENT>
