<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the influence of internal carotid artery (ICA) tortuosity on the effectiveness of 4 cerebral protection filters in an in vitro bench-top model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To simulate the anatomical arterial variants, 3 open flow models were constructed: one with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, 1 representing a mildly tortuous ICA, and a third imitating a severely tortuous ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polyvinyl alcohol particles (150-1000 microm) served as the embolic material; the emboli were divided into 3 groups according to size: small (150-250 microm), medium (355-500 microm), and large (710-1000 microm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five milligrams of each size group were injected separately into the ICA proximal to each of 4 protection filters: AngioGuard, FilterWire EX, TRAP, and NeuroShield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emboli that were not caught by the protection system or were washed into the external carotid artery (ECA) ran into an effluent filter and were weighed and classified according to size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 240 test runs, the FilterWire EX presented the lowest weight of emboli in the ICA effluent under <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anatomical conditions: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> 0.39 mg (2.58%), mild tortuosity 0.45 mg (2.99%), and severe tortuosity 0.50 mg (3.33%) (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Angioguard system showed the worst results: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 1.21 mg (98.03%), mild tortuosity 2.54 mg (16.84%), and severe tortuosity 3.14 mg (20.91%) (p&lt;0.001) compared to the FilterWire EX and the NeuroShield systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only protection device displaying no significant differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 3 emboli sizes was the FilterWire EX (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relevant differences in effectiveness in mildly and severely tortuous ICAs were apparent among the other devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> emboli sizes, the differences of the AngioGuard and TRAP systems were highly significant (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the FilterWire EX and the NeuroShield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The only protection device showing no significant decrease in efficacy in the tortuous ICA models was the FilterWire EX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In both tested anatomical variants, the protection systems ranked in the same order of effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the tested devices prevented embolization completely </plain></SENT>
