<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the subjects who had not had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by the time of study entry, 3435 were cigarette smokers and 4437 were nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 12 years of follow-up, 171 smokers and 117 nonsmokers had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As compared with nonsmokers, cigarette smokers had two to three times the risk of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, after control for age, diastolic blood pressure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, and other risk factors (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
