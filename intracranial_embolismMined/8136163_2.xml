<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Jude medical prosthesis in the mitral position, 520 patients were evaluated who had undergone mitral valve replacement with St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Jude medical (SJM) prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients or 3.5% died in the early postoperative period (within 30 days after operation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total follow-up was 2872 patient-years and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in 23 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> occurred in six, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complication in five, and thrombosed valve in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative anti-coagulant therapy was initiated with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> (300 mg/day) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32301">warfarin potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After discharge from our hospital the patients underwent routine examination of their thrombo-tests or prothrombin times at least every 2-3 months, and the major thromboembolic or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complication rate was 0.45%/100 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a period of 12 years, severe <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> following implantation was seen in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cause of this <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> was perivalvular leakage in two patients but there were no leakages in the other five patients, although preoperative moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three percent of the patients were followed up, and their postoperative New York Heart Association functional classes were I or II in 88.6% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their clinical results after mitral valve replacement with SJM prosthesis in the anti-anatomical position showed excellent durability and a low incidence of valve-related complications </plain></SENT>
