<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The microspheres were mainly distributed in the left cerebral hemisphere which contained 8 to 10 times more microspheres than the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Embolization caused <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> (NA) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> only in the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NA levels were already reduced 2 hours after injury while <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> was still unaltered after 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 30--40% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was observed for the two <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">Catecholamine</z:chebi> turnover was estimated by measuring the <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> after synthesis inhibition with alpha-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-p-tyrosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the first 2 hours following embolization, <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> and NA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletions</z:mpath> were slightly increased only in the left hemisphere, indicating an increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> efflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At times 24 hours, an important retardation in <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> disappearance after synthesis inhibition was found for <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> and NA in the left hemisphere and to a lesser extent for <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> in the right hemisphere, suggesting a reduction of the physiological activity of catecholaminergic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These biochemical alterations can be related to the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> behavioural changes of the embolized animals which exhibited an initially increased motor activity followed by a lethargic state </plain></SENT>
