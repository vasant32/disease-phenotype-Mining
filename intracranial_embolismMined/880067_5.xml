<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy percent of those infarctions showed a mass effect that had disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by the eighth week after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 63%, there was enhancement after contrast infusion, with a definite temporal relationship to the day of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty percent of the patients initially had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT scans that became abnormal weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radionuclide scans were positive in the patients who showed contrast enhancement, and the area of abnormal uptake correlated well with the area of enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The timing of the performance of the CT scan in relation to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological deficit is an important factor to consider when evaluating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome with CT </plain></SENT>
