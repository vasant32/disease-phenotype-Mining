<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) have been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), although their origin and contribution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> among patients with SAH and to determine their origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients with SAH, comprising 15 aneurysmal and 12 non-aneurysmal patients, participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD evaluation was performed using a 2 MHz probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were studied three times per week during their in-patient stay to detect vasospasm, and then each middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was monitored for 30 min using the Monolateral Multigate mode to detect <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this method, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 7 out of 15 patients (47%) with aneurysmal SAH and were not seen in non-aneurysmal patients (p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm occurred in 52% (14/27) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, clinical signs and symptoms of vasospasm were identified in only 18.5% (5/27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant relationship between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and vasospasm (p=0.224) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, no relationship was found between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and the location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (p=0.685) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this study <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were only detected in aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, we did not find a relationship between the location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, or the presence of vasospasm and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in patients with SAH may also originate from vascular pathology other than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sac or vascular spasm </plain></SENT>
