<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From July 1991 to March 1995, 178 patients who underwent 198 carotid surgical repairs were investigated preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative TCD evaluation showed stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in 4 patients (2.2%), siphon stenosis in 3 (1.6%), incomplete circle of Willis in 23 (12.9%), a decrease of mean blood flow velocity more than 70% of the basal value during digital common carotid compression in 31 (17.9%), and a critical reduction of vasomotor reactivity (no significant increase of mean blood flow velocity in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> during breath-holding test) in 34 (19.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (5%) had surgery without preoperative angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In those patients the indication for surgery was based on color Doppler imaging and TCD investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety surgical procedures were carried out under general anesthesia and 188 under locoregional anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 37 surgeries (31.7%) a shunt was inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of a shunt was based on a decrease of mean blood flow velocity in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> below 50% of the basal value under general anesthesia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> combined with a decrease of mean blood flow velocity in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> higher than 70% of the basal value when locoregional anesthesia was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative TCD monitoring showed a decrease of mean blood flow velocity in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> due to shunt malfunction in (8.3%) of 36 surgeries, turbulence of blood flow during declamping in 79 procedures (39.8%), and microembolic events in 10 patients (5%) that were related to one transient and one permanent neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another permanent deficit occurred in a patient without TCD signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After surgery, TCD reliably detected an early asymptomatic occlusion of the carotid artery, hyperperfusion syndrome in 12 (6.0%), and an increase of vasomotor reactivity in 10 (29.4%) of 34 surgeries </plain></SENT>
