<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, prolonged ischemic neurological deficits, completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, low perfusion syndromes and ischemic ocular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The microvascular anastomosis is performed between a branch of the external carotid artery and a cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients we performed a bilateral bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We had no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The morbidity was 5%, the patency rate 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of the microvascular procedure can be determined by comparing the postoperative follow-up (averaging 22 months) and the natural course of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical benefit is gained in the elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients considered candidates for diagnostic studies are those presenting with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally in patients with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> extra-intracranial bypass procedures may prove to be of value, when carried out in a combined approach </plain></SENT>
