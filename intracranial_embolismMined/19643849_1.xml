<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study compared the occurrence of intraoperative microemboli and postoperative changes in neuropsychological performance in 195 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who were randomized to intermittent crossclamp <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> or cardioplegic arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli were recorded from cannulation to 15 min after decannulation, using transcranial Doppler in 166 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microemboli in relation to 9 surgical events were also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological change scores were obtained by comparing cognitive performance preoperatively with that at 6-8 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median number of microemboli detected was 105 (range, 9-1,757) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> group, and 110 (range, 1-1,306) in the cardioplegia group, with no significant difference between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant difference between groups in the generation of microemboli during any of the surgical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological tests were completed postoperatively by 177 participants, with no significant differences in performance found between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the equivalence of the effect of intermittent crossclamp <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> and cardioplegic arrest on microemboli and neuropsychology, consideration of which form of myocardial protection to employ should perhaps focus more on which method affords most protection to the heart </plain></SENT>
