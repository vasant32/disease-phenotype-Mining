<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether particular carotid plaque features on ultrasound are more likely to produce microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have reviewed 71 patients with moderate or high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> established by ultrasound (30-99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plaque appearance was classified according to five subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial monitoring of the middle cerebral arteries was performed on each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were more frequently encountered in patients with anechogenic/hypoechogenic plaques compared with isoechogenic/hyperechogenic lesions (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>+ patients presented also more frequently an irregular surface of the plaque and more severe stenosis, however, the differences did not reach significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When considering the different above mentioned variables (logistic regression), only plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> appeared to be a risk factor for the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>+ patients presented a significantly increased frequency of anechogenic/hypoechogenic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> may be a marker of increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the clinical significance of this particular association should be further investigated </plain></SENT>
