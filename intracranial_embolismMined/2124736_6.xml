<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator in reducing cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> in a rabbit model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen rabbits were randomized to receive either tissue plasminogen activator (2.5 mg/kg, n = 6) or vehicle control (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We controlled mean arterial pressure, hematocrit, and arterial blood gases before and after the intracarotid embolization of an autologous clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (cm3/100 g/min) (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) was immediately reduced from 55.2 +/- 7.7 to 8.5 +/- 2.5 in the control group and from 61.8 +/- 14.8 to 10.0 +/- 3.5 in the treated group after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow recovered significantly within 60 minutes of thrombolytic therapy and attained a value of 59.6 +/- 10.0 cm3/100 g/min 4 hours after embolization, whereas cerebral blood flow in control animals demonstrated only a minimal recovery to 15.3 +/- 8.9 cm3/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (percent of hemisphere) was reduced from 34.4 +/- 5.6% in control animals to 8.8 +/- 5.6% in treated animals (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that tissue plasminogen activator may be efficacious in restoring cerebral blood flow and thus limiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
