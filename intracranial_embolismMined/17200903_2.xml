<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We retrospectively evaluated our experience with stenting of the vertebral artery in an effort to determine the risk of distal embolization associated with the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 2000 and May 2005, 35 patients with 38 stenting procedures for atherosclerotic disease of the vertebral origin in our institution were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average age of the patients was 60.3 years (range 32-76 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of these patients (with 18 stents) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and an apparent diffusion coefficient map within 2 days before and after procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On seven of the 16 postprocedural diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, a total of 57 new hyperintensities were visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these lesions were focal in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient demonstrated a new diffusion-weighted imaging abnormality in the anterior circulation without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> evidence of posterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of 16 patients had a total of 25 new lesions in the vertebrobasilar circulation in postprocedural diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient in this group was excluded from the final analysis because the procedure was complicated by basilar rupture during tandem stent deployment in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, new diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities were noted in the vertebrobasilar territory in 5 of 15 patients after 17 stenting procedures, giving a 29% rate of diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities per procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient with bilateral stenting had new diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stenting of stenoses of the vertebral artery origin may be associated with a significant risk of asymptomatic distal embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Angiography, placement of the guiding catheter, inflation of the stent balloon, and crossing the lesion with guidewires or balloon catheters may potentially cause distal embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies to evaluate measures to increase the safety of vertebral artery stenting, such as the use of distal protection devices or short-term postprocedural anticoagulation, should be considered for patients with clear indications for this procedure </plain></SENT>
