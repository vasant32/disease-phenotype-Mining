<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-one symptomatic patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging prior to carotid endarterectomy for high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number and volume of white matter hyperintense lesions (WMHL) on fluid attenuated inversion recovery brain scans were compared according to the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of carotid plaque based upon the American Heart Association (<z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>) histological classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 57 patients who had good quality brain scans and non-fragmented carotid plaques, 15 plaques were defined as stable (type V) and 42 as unstable (type VI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for the major risk factors affecting WMHL, unstable carotid plaques were found to be associated with more WMHL in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere than stable plaques (transformed means 2.50+/-1.2 vs. 1.53+/-1.1, p=0.016), however, there was only a trend towards larger WMHL volumes (p=0.079) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed association between unstable carotid plaques and the number of white matter lesions suggest that thromboembolic plaque activity may contribute to the development of leukoaraiosis, in particular smaller individual lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are warranted to confirm this finding and explore the potential clinical impact for selecting candidates for carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
