<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite systemic heparinization, thromboembolic complications remain a major concern related to endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the safety of intravenous eptifibatide administered during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> coiling procedures to prevent such complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From August 2001 to November 2004, 298 coil embolization procedures were performed to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>; eptifibatide was used in 84 endovascular coil embolization procedures to treat 79 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 74 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed medical charts, radiographic images, and procedure notes to evaluate periprocedural complications related to eptifibatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the 74 patients in our cohort was 55 +/- 9 years (range, 31-84) harboring 79 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (32 ruptured/47 unruptured) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eptifibatide was given prophylactically in 77 procedures, whereas in 7 procedures, it was given for treatment of a thromboembolic event (visualization of an arterial branch occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 5 (5.9% [total cohort]) <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications related to eptifibatide occurred during 84 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients (2.4% [total cohort]/6.3% [ruptured group]) developed intracerebral hemorrhagic complications exacerbated by eptifibatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other 3 (3.6% [total cohort]) patients had groin <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> requiring blood transfusions but had no surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One thromboembolic event occurred in the 77 patients receiving eptifibatide prophylactically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous infusion of eptifibatide seems to be safe to administer in patients undergoing endovascular repair of an unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Caution must be used in patients harboring ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> as <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> complications may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further study is required to delineate the group of patients most likely to benefit from this therapy </plain></SENT>
