<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We had shown that appropriate support of these stem cells, achieved by therapeutic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, enhances neurological recovery in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, we started cell based therapy using autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells for patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> as phase 1/2a clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have treated 6 patients in low dose group (harvest 25 ml of bone marrow cells) and none of them showed treatment-related adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We are now recruiting another 6 patients in high dose group (harvest 50 ml of bone marrow cells) and are planning to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the therapy after obtaining the results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 patients </plain></SENT>
