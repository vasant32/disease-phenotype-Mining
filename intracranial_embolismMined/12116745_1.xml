<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The authors investigated whether ultrasonic characteristics of embolic signals could be used to differentiate embolic composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors analyzed high-intensity transient signals (HITS) from 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> during the bubble contrast test and during total joint replacement surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 3 anesthetized dogs, latex microspheres, fat particles, and air bubbles were injected into the internal carotid artery and HITS were identified in the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve quantified the usefulness of each measure to distinguish embolic composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In humans, HITS intensity (area: 0.80) and frequency (area: 0.73) but not duration (area: 0.32) were useful to distinguish air bubbles from presumed solid emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In animals, intensity distinguished microspheres from air (area: 0.94) and microspheres from fat (area: 0.94) but was less useful for fat and air (area: 0.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The duration (area: 0.54-0.76) and frequency (area: 0.54-0.63) were poor discriminators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HITS intensity best distinguished embolic composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Particle size should be taken into account in future research </plain></SENT>
