<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of antibodies directed against a leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM-1) in an embolic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> followed by thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test whether reperfusion injury after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was related to white cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, microclots were injected into carotid circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conditions examined were control, alpha-ICAM 5 min following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, tPA 30 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and the combination of alpha-ICAM and tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>alpha-ICAM and tPA both increased the amount of clot necessary to produce permanent neurological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combined therapy was no more effective than either substance alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar outcome was obtained when tPA was delayed until 90 min postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When thrombolysis was delayed 3 h following embolism, neither tPA nor the tPA/alpha-ICAM combination reduced neurological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the alpha-ICAM antibody and tPA each effectively reduced neurological damage but the interaction was not significant </plain></SENT>
