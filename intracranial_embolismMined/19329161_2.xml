<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting in patients with high surgical risk is considered as an effective alternative to carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the occurrence of distal embolization with CAS is still a major concern, an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection device is usually used during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a technique for observation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection filter and evaluated the debris or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> microscopically, and the pathologic findings were compared with preoperative imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After completing CAS, the filter membrane was stained with HE solution and removed from filter strut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mounting onto a glass slide, the filter was evaluated under a microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plaque debris and appearance of filter membrane were evaluated, and the covered area was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathologic findings were compared with preoperative imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microscopic observation of the slide revealed atheromatous debris as well as thrombotic material to the filter membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin stain facilitates the characterization of the debris composition, namely, thrombotic debris, calcified debris, organized debris, fibrous debris, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-rich debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The subtypes of debris were consistent with preoperative imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, in cases of intraprocedural flow impairment, more than 50% of the filter area was covered with debris or thrombotic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid plaque debris captured during carotid stenting with protection filter can be visualized with HE stain on the glass side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This simple method allows us to better understand the plaque debris and appearance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection filter </plain></SENT>
