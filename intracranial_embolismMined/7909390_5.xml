<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present case documents the occurrence of embolism by a nonobstructive compression maneuver during transcranial Doppler examination, resulting in a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old man suffered from recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Duplex sonography showed a small echogenic plaque at the right carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During transcranial Doppler studies with a reverberating compression maneuver of the right common carotid artery low in the neck, multiple emboli signals were detected, and the patient developed a left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001350'>slurred speech</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Funduscopy revealed cholesterol emboli in the inferior temporal arteriole of the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested embolization as the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compression maneuvers should not be performed in patients with recent neurological symptoms, even in the case of only small lesions in the extracranial carotid territory </plain></SENT>
