<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A vascular thrombotic lesion localized to the rat sensorimotor cortex was produced following intravenous injection of the photosensitive dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>, and its activation with a small beam of high-intensity white light focused to the skull overlaying the sensorimotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the sensorimotor cortex at various times after the triggering event, two contiguous brain regions with different degree(s) of neuronal damage can be distinguished: (1) a primary thrombotic ischemic core where the majority of cells are dead and (2) a penumbra region surrounding the core lesion in which a slower progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> is occurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Importantly, in both brain regions the <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> is associated with the activation and persistent translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) as indicated by an increase in 4-beta-3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate</z:chebi> (3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi>) binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the demonstration that in the area penumbra the <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> and the persistent translocation of PKC can be inhibited by a pretreatment with dizocilpine (i.e., MK-801) indicates that the dynamics of the progression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> are maintained by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> accumulating in the extraneuronal fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MK-801 additionally prevents the transcriptional activation of several immediate-early genes (IEGs) (e.g., c-fos) and their cognate third nuclear messenger (i.e., c-Fos) expression present in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, LIGA4 and LIGA20 derivatives of GM1 lysoganglioside reduce the membrane translocation of PKC and the neuronal damage in the penumbra area, but fail to change the increase of IEG expression in the cortex ipsilateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
