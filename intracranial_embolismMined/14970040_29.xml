<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early reocclusion of recanalized arteries has been observed after thrombolysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> and has been attributed to platelet activation after exposure to thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study to determine the rate of reocclusion during intra-arterial thrombolysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and the effect of reocclusion on functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> at our center between September 2000 and May 2002 received a maximum total dose of 4 U of reteplase intra-arterially in 1-U increments via superselective catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic thrombolysis was supplemented by mechanical thrombolysis with balloon angioplasty or snare manipulation at the occlusion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed after each unit of reteplase or mechanical maneuver, and the images were interpreted by a blinded reviewer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reocclusion was defined as partial or complete initial recanalization with occlusion recurring at the same site as documented by angiography during the endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reocclusions were treated by further pharmacologic and/or mechanical thrombolysis according to the discretion of the treating physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluations were performed before and 24 hr, 7 to 10 days, and 1 to 3 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six consecutive patients underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reocclusion was observed in eight (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, initial sites of occlusion were in the following arteries: intracranial internal carotid artery (n = 2), M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (n = 3), M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery (n = 2), and basilar artery (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean initial National Institutes of Health Scale score for these eight patients was 23.3 +/- 6.2; mean time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment was 4.4 +/- 1.2 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The reocclusions were treated by using additional doses of reteplase alone (n = 1), reteplase with snare maneuver and/or angioplasty (n = 5), reteplase with angioplasty or snare and then stent placement (n = 1), and angioplasty with stent placement (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The reocclusions resolved in six of eight patients after further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six patients died and two survived but were severely disabled at 1 month (modified Rankin Scale scores of 4 and 5, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Independent functional outcome scores (modified Rankin Scale scores of 0-2) were significantly lower among patients with angiographically shown reocclusion than in those without (0 of 8 versus 17 of 38, P =.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reocclusion occurs relatively frequently during intra-arterial thrombolysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and seems to be associated with poor clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
