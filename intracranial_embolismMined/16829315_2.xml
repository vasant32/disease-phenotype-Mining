<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we survey signals from 1485 emboli, assumed to consist predominantly of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained by monitoring the middle cerebral arteries of 100 consecutive CEA patients during postoperative recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of embolic signal frequencies, intensities and durations revealed that embolic signals do not occur randomly in the sonogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, we find that the signals possess a characteristic distribution of velocities reflecting the preferred path of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> through the artery (at approximately 75% of the distance between the centre of the artery and the artery wall) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals were more likely to be observed at cardiac cycle positions between 35% and 80% from the start of systole than elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After eliminating other considerations, we hypothesized that this peak in the distribution of signals in the sonogram arose due to the localization of emboli trajectories and a strong tendency for emboli to detach from the carotid bifurcation during systole </plain></SENT>
