<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Restrospective analysis of the data from the Lausanne <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 3038 patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> consecutively admitted to a primary-care <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological worsening in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological worsening was observed in 38% of 300 patients with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, 34% of 1968 patients with noncardioembolic infarction, and 15% of 770 patients with cardioembolic infarction (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological worsening was significantly less frequent in patients with small-artery disease than in those with large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A logistic multiple regression model in patients with noncardioembolic infarction showed age less than 65 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, lesion outside the superficial anterior circulation, absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and reduced level of consciousness as the independent factors in the patients with small-artery disease, while it showed involvement of the posterior circulation and reduced level of consciousness in the patients with large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe functional disability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was more common in patients with neurological worsening, both in patients with large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and in those with small-artery disease (18% vs 9%; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of neurological worsening may include causative aspects rather than just the evolution of the ischemic or hemorrhagic process itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For a better comprehension and treatment of neurological worsening, the causative and pathophysiological conditions underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> should be differentiated as early as possible </plain></SENT>
