<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was obtained in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation with clinical symptoms was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> were the most common clinical symptoms at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT revealed hyperdense basilar arteries (n = 7) and hypodensities in the posterior circulation territory (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one instance, the infarction was hemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging showed absence of flow void within the basilar in 6 patients and MRA (using both PC and TOF techniques) confirmed absence of blood flow in 4 basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One week after presentation, 5 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Autopsy was obtained in 1 case and confirmed the diagnosis of basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has fairly typical imaging features by both CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
