<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: From January 1987 to December 2004, 57 pediatric patients; 28 females and 29 males, age ranged from 2 months to 15 years, mean of 8.64 +/- 3.82 years, classified as "definite" IE according to the Duke criteria were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 57 patients, 42 patients (74%) had underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo>, 7 patients (12%) had underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e>, 8 patients (14%) had previously <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had history of previously palliative or corrective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood cultures were positive in 26 patients (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Streptococci and staphylococci were the most commonly isolated organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated vegetations in 56 patients (98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The location of the vegetations was in the right heart in 30 patients (54%) and in the left heart in 26 patients (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 28 patients (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Common complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, septic shock, and mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality was 11% (6 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By statistical analysis, vegetations in the left heart had a higher incidence of complication than that in the right heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The vegetation size of &gt; or =10 mm had a significant higher incidence of embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical features and outcomes of the present study have a similar pattern as the earlier studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The rates of complications and mortality are still high </plain></SENT>
