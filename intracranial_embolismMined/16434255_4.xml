<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> in cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An intra-aortic filter might reduce this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to analyze the risks for emboli associated with intraluminal aortic manipulation and intra-aortic filter handling in relation to cannulation and external clamp maneuvers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A model was designed with a cadaver aorta and retrograde perfusion (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A crossclamp was positioned on the ascending aorta and repeatedly opened under pressure to collect aliquots with dislodged particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cannulation was performed after 10 clamp maneuvers, followed by positioning and removing the intra-aortic filter, with each step followed by a washout sequence to collect perfusate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The removed filter was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluation was by means of digital image analysis, with differentiation of particles into different spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intra-aortic filter manipulation produced a significant washout of embolic particles; in particular, this was seen for the macroscopic cellular spectrum (P = .006 and P = .002 for filter insertion and removal, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Particles were also found to be collected by the filter (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, cannulation and aortic crossclamp manipulation generated a notable number of particles (P = .001 and P = .013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The intra-aortic filter collects material during aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, intraluminal aortic manipulation from filter handling can also dislodge particles, possibly related to shedding of intimal debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is in addition to substantial amounts of particles that are generated by aortic cannulation and aortic crossclamping </plain></SENT>
