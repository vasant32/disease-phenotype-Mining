<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images (DWIs) are believed to correspond accurately with cerebral ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) can reveal hemodynamic and embolic events during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine whether the occurrence of hyperintense signals on postoperative DWIs corresponds to intraoperative embolic or hemodynamic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-seven CEAs were monitored intraoperatively with TCD to record blood flow velocity changes after cross clamping to ascertain the presence of adequate collateral flow and to record microembolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DWI was used to classify the hemisphere ipsilateral to the CEA by type: 0, no lesions (n = 51); I, cortical lesions only (n = 2); II, subcortical white matter lesions only (n = 6); III, mixed type with cortical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> (n = 11); IV, large territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (n = 6); and V, other types of lesions (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither the five clinical events (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, two minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and two major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) nor any DWI type (I-V) showed a relationship to blood velocity decreases after cross clamping or, in patients who were selectively shunted, to total ischemic time necessary for shunt insertion and removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total microembolic signal count was significantly higher in the five CEAs with clinical events than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also higher on the DWIs showing a hyperintense lesion as compared with DWIs showing no lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Apart from lesions corresponding to clinical deficits, CEA is associated with a substantial number of small areas of brain tissue at risk for irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main cause of intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> seems to be embolism, suggesting that microembolic signals in CEA are highly relevant events for brain tissue </plain></SENT>
