<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> process in rat brain provoked by two different blood clot components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An intracerebral clot was produced by stereotactic injection of 100 microl of either blood (bICH) or cryoprecipitate/thrombin (pICH) into the right caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Water, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>, K+, and <z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cl-</z:chebi> contents were measured at 0, 4.24, 48, and 72 h after instillation of the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the first 24 h, the water content of the ipsilateral caudate nucleus and cortex gradually increased in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By 48 h <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was more severe in the bICH compared to that with pICH in the ipsilateral basal ganglia and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation was accompanied by significant increase in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, as well as a decrease in <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> content by 48 h and sustained to 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that both blood and plasma clots can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, but a plasma clot is less damaging than a blood clot in the immediate vicinity of the mass </plain></SENT>
