<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and hereditary resistance to activated protein C (APC) in 12 consecutive German patients with non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and in 187 controls without a history of thrombotic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients (25%) had a mutation in the factor V Leiden gene against only one subject in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This difference was significant (P &lt; 0.05), with an odds ratio of 11.7 (1.5-87; 95% confidence interval) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients carrying the mutation had additional common risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and 2 had a positive family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that inherited APC resistance by a mutation in factor V Leiden is an important risk factor in non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recommend testing for APC resistance and, if abnormal for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
