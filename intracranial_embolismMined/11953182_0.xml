<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Operation through femoral cannulation via artificial vessel was performed upon 159 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, 89 of Stanford type A and 70 of Stanford type B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An artificial vessel was anastomosed end-to-side to the femural artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Femoral catheter was inserted via this artificial vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in 90 patients, among which 31 had deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left heart bypass was performed in 69 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: False lumen perfusion was detected during cardiopulmonary bypass in 7 patients (4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral events occurred in 7 patients (two patients with diffused cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> with one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>12 patients suffered from prolonged incision recovery (9.0%), and two from local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (1.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No lower extremity <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or femoral <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found in the cannulation side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Femoral cannulation via artificial vessel effectively reduces the incidence of structure of femoral artery, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and lower extremity <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Operation through femoral cannulation via artificial vessel is very effective in treatment of aortal dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only a few cases of cerebral events caused by retrograde perfusion through femoral cannulation occurred in this group, however, with high mortality </plain></SENT>
