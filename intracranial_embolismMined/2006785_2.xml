<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study of epidemiologic relationship of these disorders to biological rhythms may lead to a better understanding and perhaps a better treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chronoepidemiologic studies demonstrated a morning peak for arterial thromboembolic disorders (cerebral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These variations might be explained partially by circadian variations in hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed chronophysiologic studies have shown that hemostatic variables follow circadian rhythms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of platelet aggregation and that of blood coagulation have been found to be increased in the morning whereas fibrinolytic activity is lower at this time of the day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The facts suggest a chronotherapeutic approach in thromboembolic disorders </plain></SENT>
