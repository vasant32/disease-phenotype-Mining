<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether this phenomenon correlates with the occurrence of perioperative microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 27 CEA patients, 18 (67%) used aspirin and 9 also used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood was collected at multiple time points before, during, and after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation and P-selectin expression were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring was used to measure microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation showed a significant increase 5 minutes postheparinization compared with preheparinization (19.7 +/- 2.8% vs 8.9 +/- 0.9% in the aspirin group and 22.5 +/- 4.4% vs 8.7 +/- 1.2% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> group; p &lt; .01 and p &lt; .05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P-selectin expression showed a tendency to increase postheparinization in both groups (p = .07 and p = .09, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of microemboli ranged from 0 to 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> patients displayed fewer microemboli than aspirin patients (4.1 +/- 2.3 vs 17.6 +/- 18.2; p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with a high number of microemboli displayed had a tendency toward higher baseline platelet aggregation than patients with a low number of microemboli (p = .08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, platelet aggregation is transiently increased during CEA despite the administration of antiplatelet agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> is associated with a decreased number of perioperative microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The exact relationships between these findings, postoperative microemboli formation, and the risk for thromboembolic complications after CEA remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
