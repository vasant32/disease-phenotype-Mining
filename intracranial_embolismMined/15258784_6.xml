<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We monitored the middle cerebral artery in two different depths (48 mm and 53 mm) by continuous transcranial Doppler ultrasound during transcatheter <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure in 35 consecutive patients (F/M 20/15, mean age 47 +/- 11 years) and during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> closure in 8 patients (F/M 7/1, mean age 45 +/- 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> automatically detected high intensity transient signals (HITS) were manually reviewed to eliminate artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HITS were detected in 33 of 35 patients (96%) with a median rate of 8 (interquartile range 4-19, range 2-29) HITS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest rates were observed when the septum was crossed with the guide wire (median 2; IQR 0-12; range 0-25) and when the left atrial disc was deployed (median 2; IQR 1-4; range 0-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this high rate of cerebral microembolism no clinically apparent neurological or neuropsychological deficit was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> frequently occurs during transcatheter <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The peak of HITS at the time of crossing the septum with the guide wire may support the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> may originate from the septum itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may represent an alternative mechanism to the generally assumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
