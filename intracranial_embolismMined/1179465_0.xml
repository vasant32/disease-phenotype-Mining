<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The functional condition of 260 patients in eight categories of cerebrovascular disease was determined at discharge and three years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cumulative probability of five-year survival was calculated for 400 patients and compared to the population at large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical variables were related to the prognosis in 155 patients with anterior circulation infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality during hospitalization varied from 8% to 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More than half of the patients in most diagnostic groups died within three years of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 22% of patients with anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were fully ambulatory three years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prognosis worsened markedly with age and known pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and survival was decreased in blacks and in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall five-year survival probability for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients discharged alive was 49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival was similar in patients discharged ambulatory with or without aid, but poor in patients not ambulatory at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Less than half as many individuals in the anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> group survived five years than did in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for blacks was even somewhat worse when compared to the black population at large </plain></SENT>
