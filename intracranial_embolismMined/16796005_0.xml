<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 96 plaques were evaluated following carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, each plaque was screened by ultrasound and assessed by means of 2 computer assisted methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated for ME (measured as hits) intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The removed plaques were assessed visually (intraoperative assessement) and histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of risk factors were included as a final outcome event for the purpose of multivariate regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Detailed plaque texture analysis (DPTA) predicts best the risk of perioperative complications and ME (p = 0.029 and p = 0.028 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the standard gray-scale median (GSM) analysis did not reach the statistical significance (p &gt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of the model (ROC) was 0.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multivariate model for ME revealed that from the level of &gt; 5 HITS, a rapid increase in the risk of perioperative complications (rise of 5% by every 1 hit) is seen and correlates well with the DPTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ROC was 0.77 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A direct correlation between the DPTA and perioperative ME was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DPTA analysis of a carotid plaque is more predictive of the likelihood of microembolism than the GSM analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is a direct correlation between the perioperative ME and plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, as assessed by DPTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This supports the need for further refinements in noninvasive analysis of carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
