<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by a photochemical reaction between green light and systemic injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During this experiment, auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were recorded and cochlear blood flow (CBF) was measured by a laser doppler flowmeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 5 weeks after the procedure, histopathological changes were studied by light microscopy following the observation of equilibrium dysfunction and ABR recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBF was reduced from the baseline in 30.8 +/- 3.4% (mean +/- SE, n = 25) by occlusion of the AICA, ABR was altered in 96% of animals, and equilibrium dysfunction was observed in 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the AICA was not reopened within a short time, severe histopathological changes were frequently observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between equilibrium dysfunction and histopathological changes in the vestibule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that this experimental model may be useful for investigating functional and histopathological changes in the ischemic inner ear </plain></SENT>
