<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to determine whether nefiracetam, N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-2-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27856">acetamide</z:chebi>, a cognition enhancer, has an effect on learning and memory function in sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and whether the effect, if any, may accompany modification of the cholinergic or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>)ergic system, which are conceived to be involved in the learning and memory function, in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by the injection of 700 microspheres into the right hemisphere of the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were treated once daily with 10 mg/kg nefiracetam p.o. from 15 h after the operation to either 10 days for the water maze study, or 3 or 5 days after the operation for neurochemical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microsphere-embolized rats showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like symptoms 15 h after the operation and lengthened the escape latency in the water maze task on days 7-10, suggesting a spatial learning dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The delayed treatment did not reduce the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like symptoms, but effectively shortened the escape latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals at days 3 and 5 after the operation showed decreases in <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> content and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase activity, which were not prevented by nefiracetam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The microsphere-embolized rats showed decreases in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> content and glutamic acid decarboxylase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The delayed treatment appreciably restored <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> content in the hippocampus on day 5 and reversed glutamic acid decarboxylase activity in both brain regions on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the GABAergic activity rather than the cholinergic activity may be, at least in part, involved in the pharmacological effects of nefiracetam in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
