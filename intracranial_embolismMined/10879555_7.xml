<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo carotid angioplasty studies using human carotid plaques have shown that embolic particles were released from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, transcranial Doppler studies have confirmed the presence of multiple emboli in the middle cerebral artery during carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preliminary experience with the use of brain protection devices for carotid stenting have shown encouraging results in terms of safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, embolic particles have been recovered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in which protection devices have been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We provide the rationale for routine use of these protection devices and also review the various protection devices on the horizon </plain></SENT>
