<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral angiography is associated with a small but definite risk of neurological complications with an unknown incidence of clinically silent embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the neurological complication rate compared with the frequency of silent embolism after angiography METHODS: We used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after angiography to assess embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>100 consecutive angiographies (66 diagnostic and 34 interventional procedures) were done on 91 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent neurological assessment before, immediately after, and 1 day after angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Before angiography, no abnormalities were seen on diffusion-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted MRI showed 42 bright lesions in 23 patients after 23 procedures (17 diagnostic, six interventional) in a pattern consistent with embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no new neurological deficit after any angiographic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After diagnostic angiography in patients with a history of vasculopathy, the frequency of lesions was significantly higher than in patients without vascular risk factors (12 [44%] of 27 vs five [13%] of 39 patients, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In diagnostic angiography, the appearance of lesions was significantly correlated with whether vessels were difficult to probe (p=0.01), amount of contrast medium needed (p&lt;0.01), fluoroscopy time (p&lt;0.01), and use of additional catheters (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: After diagnostic and interventional cerebral angiography, embolic events are more frequent than the apparent neurological complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In diagnostic procedures, the incidence of embolism is closely related to a vascular risk profile </plain></SENT>
