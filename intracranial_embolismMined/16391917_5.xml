<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the results of two procedures to protect against distal embolism caused by embolic debris from carotid angioplasty with stent deployment (CAS) using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study group comprised 39 men and 3 women (42 and 3 CAS procedures, respectively) with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (average age 70.0 +/- 6.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During 20 CAS procedures the internal carotid artery was protected with a single balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A PercuSurge GuardWire was used for temporary occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 25 CAS procedures the internal and external carotid arteries were simultaneously temporarily occluded with a PercuSurge GuardWire and a Sentry balloon catheter, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted MRI was performed 1 to 3 days after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data from 26 patients undergoing conventional angiography for diagnosis of cerebral ischemic disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> were included as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted MRI after conventional diagnostic angiography showed ischemic spots in 3 of the 26 controls (11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ischemic spots were observed during 11 of 20 CAS procedures with the internal carotid artery protected with a single balloon (55.0%), and were observed during 9 of 25 CAS procedures with both the internal and external carotid arteries protected (36.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference was significant (P = 0.0068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesions appeared not only ipsilateral to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> but also in the contralateral carotid artery (31.9%) and vertebrobasilar territory (25.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Better protection was obtained with simultaneous double occlusion of both the internal and external carotid artery than with single protection of the internal carotid artery during CAS </plain></SENT>
