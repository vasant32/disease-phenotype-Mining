<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had preoperative computed tomographic scans which revealed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and underwent successful corrective cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the early postoperative period, 4 patients died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the 3 surviving patients showed no aggravation of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining surviving patient, intracerebral mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were resolved spontaneously after postoperative antibiotic therapy, although new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, a complication of emboli, occurred after open heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicated that 1) cerebrovascular complications were the causes of the 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this series, and 2) although heparinization during open heart surgery may result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> from mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or infarction, early surgical intervention after recent cardiogenic embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> may save patients with minor cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
