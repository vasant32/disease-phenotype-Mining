<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A transcranial Doppler monitoring of the medial cerebral artery was performed in 15 patients undergoing proximal arch replacement with SCP (SCP group) and 15 patients undergoing replacement of the ascending aorta (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the high-intensity transient signal counts between the SCP group and the control group at any phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the SCP group, 4.8% of microemboli occurred during cross-clamping, and only 0.6% occurred during SCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control group, 4.6% occurred during cross-clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most microemboli occurred after removing the cross-clamps in both groups; 92.2% in the SCP group and 92.1% in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that outbreak frequency of microemboli during SCP was very low, and thus implies that the risk of embolic event that may be caused by SCP is very low </plain></SENT>
