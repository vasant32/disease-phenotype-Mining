<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that treatment with the cytokine human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) resulted in a beneficial outcome in a rabbit model of thromboembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rabbits administered subcutaneously with IFN-beta prior to (pre-treatment) or after (post-treatment) the introduction of an autologous blood clot into the middle cerebral artery have consistently smaller subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes compared to control (untreated) counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of pre-treatment rabbits is 46.3+/-9.3 mm(3) (n=4), and that of post-treatment rabbit is 40.0+/-23.1 mm(3) (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both are significantly lower (P=0.003 and P=0.004, respectively) than the average subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of control rabbits (121.6+/-32.9 mm(3), n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the precise mechanism responsible for the beneficial effect of IFN-beta on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is not yet clear, our results are in line with the known anti-inflammatory potential and anti-apoptotic function of IFN-beta </plain></SENT>
