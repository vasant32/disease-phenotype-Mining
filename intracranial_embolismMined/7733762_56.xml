<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> include age and years of education; perioperative factors including number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, temperature, mean arterial pressure, and jugular bulb oxygen saturation have varying predictive power </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictive power and weapons to reduce cellular injury associated with neurologic insults lend hope of a future ability to markedly decrease the impact of cardiopulmonary bypass on short-term and long-term neurologic, cognitive, and quality-of-life outcomes </plain></SENT>
