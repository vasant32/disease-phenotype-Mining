<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment with a selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi>, VELCADE, in combination with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) extended the therapeutic window to 6 hours in young rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disability in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the effect of VELCADE in combination with a low-dose tPA on aged rats after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats at the age of 18 to 20 months were treated with VELCADE (0.2 mg/kg) alone, a low-dose tPA (5 mg/kg) alone, combination of VELCADE and tPA, or saline 2 hours after embolic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test the contribution of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase to VELCADE-mediated neuroprotection, endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase knockout and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice were treated with VELCADE (0.5 mg/kg) 2 hours after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with VELCADE significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, whereas tPA alone did not reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and aggravated blood-brain barrier disruption in aged rats compared with saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the combination treatment significantly enhanced the reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, which was associated with an increase in endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase activity compared with saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the combination treatment promoted thrombolysis and did not increase the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VELCADE significantly reduced lesion volume in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice but failed to significantly reduce lesion volume in endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with VELCADE exerts a neuroprotective effect in aged rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination of VELCADE with the low-dose tPA further amplifies the neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase at least partly contributes to VELCADE-mediated neuroprotection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
