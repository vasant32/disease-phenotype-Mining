<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An experimental cerebral embolic model was prepared by an injection of [125I]fibrin clot particles (20-100 microns) into the left internal carotid artery in rats, and the changes in radioactivity of the brain were continuously monitored by a gamma-ray detector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The autoradiograms of the caput transections showed the existence of emboli in small vessels of the left hemicerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the injection of [125I]fibrin clots, the radioactivity spontaneously decreased to a half of the initial radioactivity at 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decrease in radioactivity which represented the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> dissolution was markedly suppressed by an antiplasmin agent, trans-4-aminomethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29005">cyclohexane</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33575">carboxylic acid</z:chebi>, indicating that the endogenous fibrinolysis through the activation of plasminogen is generated in the cerebral small vessels after the embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consecutive injection of fibrin clots caused a summation of the radioactivity and decreased the rate of dissolution at every <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thrombolytic agents were infused via the left internal carotid artery for 30 min after the second successive injection of fibrin clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the spontaneous dissolution of emboli was observed during the infusion of saline, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) as well as urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) produced a further dissolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of the emboli disappeared 60 min after the infusion of t-PA at a dose of 75 micrograms/kg and at a dose of 10000 IU/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
