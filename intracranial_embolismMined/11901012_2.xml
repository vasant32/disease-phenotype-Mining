<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the use of 2-poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">hydroxyethyl-methacrylate</z:chebi> (2-P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi>) as an embolic agent in swine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In seven mini swine, experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> were created surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of treatment was complete embolization of the nidus compartment filled by the feeding artery, without brain embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six animals received pure liquid 2-P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi>, and one, 50% 2-P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For radiopacity, liquid 2-P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi> was mixed with <z:chebi fb="66" ids="27998">tungsten</z:chebi> powder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six animals underwent angiographic follow-up within 5-8 mo (mean, 6.5 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluation criteria were controllability, procedural reproducibility, and duration of the nidus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To detect complications, brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and CT were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic studies were performed to prove occlusion and assess histopathologic responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 2-P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi> was easily injected through microcatheters, with a reproducible technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of the radiopacity of the mixture, deep nidus penetration was controlled with fluoroscopy and confirmed with CT and histopathologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In five <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> embolized with pure 2-P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi>, feeder obliteration was long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One animal had vasospasm during embolization, and complete obliteration of the main feeder was maintained for 3 mo, but partial recanalization developed 2 mo later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One animal receiving pure 2-P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi> had an infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the animal embolized with 50% 2-P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi>, angiography and CT revealed embolic material in the circle of Willis; the animal died after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No marked inflammatory reaction in the vessel wall or perivascular tissue was observed in the embolized <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> embolization with pure 2-P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi>, made radiopaque with <z:chebi fb="66" ids="27998">tungsten</z:chebi>, is technically feasible in swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Because of its properties, 2-P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34288">HEMA</z:chebi> has great potential as a therapeutic embolic agent </plain></SENT>
