<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cannulation as well as cross clamping of the ascending aorta was avoided because there might be a definite risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> caused by liberated atheromatous debris on manipulation of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extracorporeal circulation was established by femoral arterial and right atrial cannulation, and the aorta was cross-clamped at the soft distal arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective cerebral perfusion catheters were inserted via a longitudinal aortotomy made at a soft anterior portion of the ascending aorta, through which the valve replacement procedure was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve annulus was narrow (barely 21 mm in diameter), so that the interrupted mattress suturing technique with the pledgets placed below the annulus in the left ventricular outflow tract was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By this supraannular suturing method a bioprosthesis was easily secured above the annulus as the thickened annulus was compressed between the sutures and the device </plain></SENT>
