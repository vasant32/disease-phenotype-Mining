<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical relevance of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to estimate the independent contribution of microembolism to the risk of early ischemic recurrence (EIR) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) of presumed arterial origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the incidence of EIR in 73 consecutive patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in whom TCD scanning of the symptomatic middle cerebral artery was performed within 7 days from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a potential cardiac source of embolism were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients had EIR during a mean+/-SD follow-up of 10+/-8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of EIR was 4.3 per 100 patient-days in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and only 0.5 per 100 patient-days in patients without <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was a significant predictor of EIR after adjustment for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or aortic arch atheroma, antiplatelet therapy during follow-up, and other potential confounding variables (relative risk, 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 2 to 38.2; P=0.0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microembolism is a significant independent predictor of EIR in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> of presumed arterial origin </plain></SENT>
