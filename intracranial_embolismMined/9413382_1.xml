<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomised single surgeon study of consecutive symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: 163 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> were randomised to the Javid or Pruitt shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CHIEF OUTCOME MEASURES: Middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAV), preoperatively, during clamping, during shunting and post-restoration of flow, embolic episodes, neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: The MCAV preoperatively, at carotid clamping, and postoperatively was the same for both groups (p &gt; 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During shunting the MCAV was significantly lower in the Pruitt group, p &lt; 0.005, 59% of the Javid and 34% of the Pruitt shunts maintained MCAV at preoperative levels p &lt; 0.005, chi 2 = 8.92 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Javid shunt produced significantly more emboli (73% of cases) at declamping than the Pruitt (41%), p &lt; 0.0002, chi 2 = 14.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four Javid patients and one Pruitt had disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic strokes</z:hpo>; overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> rate 3.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates was not statistically significant (p = 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Pruitt shunt was unable to maintain preoperative MCAV in 66% of cases, the Javid shunt had a higher incidence of emboli on declamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These factors may lead to an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; however, the numbers required for statistical confirmation would be large </plain></SENT>
