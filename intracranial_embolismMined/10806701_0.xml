<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 18 cases of intracranial venous embolism confirmed by Computed Tomography (CT) were eligible for this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases, 8 cases occurred before delivery and 10 post partum; 10 cases complicated by pregnancy induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 8 cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0011891'>postpartum hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> occurred most frequently, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood rheologic assay showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For 11 cases treated with urokinase, 10 were cured, while in the remaining patients, 3 of 6 cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> states were related to intracranial venous embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> were the main characters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT was an important diagnostic measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lowering intracranial pressure, anticoagulation, dethrombosis and timely ending pregnancy were the main treatment measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The early use of urokinase may exert better effect </plain></SENT>
