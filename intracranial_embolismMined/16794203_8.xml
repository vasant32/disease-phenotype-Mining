<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microembolism detected by transcranial Doppler occurs systematically during cardiac catheterization, but its clinical relevance remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies suggest that asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262004" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic cerebral infarction</z:e> detectable by diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI might exist after percutaneous cardiac interventions, especially after retrograde catheterization of the aortic valve in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>valvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, with a frequency as high as 22% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the incidence of new ischemic lesions on serial cerebral DW MRI after cardiac catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective study involved 46 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent cerebral DW MRI and neurological assessment within 24 hours before and 48 hours after cardiac catheterization and retrograde catheterization of the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subgroup was monitored by transcranial power M-mode Doppler during cardiac catheterization to observe cerebral blood flow and track emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient had a focal diffusion abnormality on DW MRI before cardiac catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After catheterization, we detected only 1 additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral diffusion abnormality in a single case (2.2%), although cerebral microemboli were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transcranial Doppler-monitored patients during cardiac catheterization, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these results a mid-point incidence of 5.9% (95% CI, 0.01 to 12.5) for abnormalities on DW MRI in asymptomatic cardiac catheterization patients in our center can be assigned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unsuspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> can be detected by DW MRI after cardiac catheterization, but this phenomenon remains unfrequent in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to identify factors explaining the discrepancy between these results and those of previous studies </plain></SENT>
