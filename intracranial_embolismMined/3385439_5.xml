<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelial injury with subsequent platelet <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was produced by means of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>-sensitized photochemical reaction, facilitated by irradiating the right proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> segment with the focused beam of an <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 15 minutes following <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> formation, diffuse leakage of HRP was observed bilaterally within cortical and subcortical brain areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peroxidase extravasation was most dense within the territory of the occluded artery including neocortical areas and dorso-lateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contralaterally, a similar distribution was observed but with less intense HRP leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural studies demonstrated an increase in permeability to HRP within arterioles, venules and capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At these sites, the vascular endothelium contained HRP-filled pinocytotic vesicles and tubular profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although less intense, bilateral HRP leakage was also observed following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis or femoral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endothelial-platelet interactions at the site of vascular injury may be responsible for releasing substances or neurohumoral factors which contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> opening of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
