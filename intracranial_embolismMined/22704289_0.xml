<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting increases sharply in the face of significant atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We use a technique that allows full revascularization for this cohort of patients, while minimizing cerebral embolic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound was used to screen for moderate or severe atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta and to precisely identify safe areas for cannulation and proximal anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using a mildly hypothermic fibrillating technique, distal revascularization was then performed without clamping the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proximal anastomoses were accomplished under brief periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We routinely use this technique and examined our results in 71 consecutive patients found to have grade 3 or greater atherosclerotic plaque of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This represented approximately 10.0% of our total population who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting over a 32-month period from January 2007 to September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient (1.4%) had a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that resolved, and there were no other neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have found that clampless fibrillating heart surgery with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> for proximal anastomoses is a safe and effective technique for revascularizing patients with significant ascending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> who are at high risk for cerebral embolic complications </plain></SENT>
