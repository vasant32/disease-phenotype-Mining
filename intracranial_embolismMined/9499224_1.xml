<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our upon own results of local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF), this article gives a short overview of recently established thrombolytic therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusions of vertebrobasilar arteries and 118 patients showing occlusions of branches of the internal carotid artery were treated with LIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Occlusion type, occlusion site and successful recanalization were associated with a favorable outcome: 92% of embolic occlusions in the vertebrobasilar territory were recanalized and resulted in 50% in a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the carotid territory, optimal outcome was achieved in main stem and branch occlusions of the middle cerebral artery, due to recanalization rates of 49%-64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, occlusions of the intracranial bifurcation of the carotid artery (carotid-"T") resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the lack of randomized trials, LIF is an established form of therapy in the vertebrobasilar territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the carotid territory randomized clinical studies could demonstrate the efficacy of intravenous fibrinolytic therapy in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It can be presumed from pilot studies that LIF is superior to the intravenous version in the carotid territory </plain></SENT>
