<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An 82-year-old man with an asymptomatic left high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was treated with carotid artery stenting (CAS) under distal protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedure consisted with predilation with a 5 x 40 mm percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) balloon, deployment of a 10 x 20 mm self-expandable stent, post-dilation with a 7 x 20 mm <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> balloon, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of debris with 60 ml of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cervical carotid angiogram immediately after deflation of the distal blocking balloon demonstrated a small in-stent filling defect of the contrast medium that protruded from the anterior wall of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following cranial carotid angiogram showed abrupt occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because the in-stent lesion had vanished in the repeat study after recognition of this embolic event, it was suggested that an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> had been liberated from the in-stent lesion, reaching the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and obliterating it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this case, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was speculated to originate in the ruptured plaque, which protruded into the stent through the cells of the device and became liberated into the bloodstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Attention should be paid so as not to overlook any plaque protrusion, which may be seen subsequently as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> on the angiogram obtained immediately after CAS </plain></SENT>
