<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Past over two years, thirteen cases of aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, including 5 proximal arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 5 transverse arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 3 distal arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, were operated under retrograde cerebral perfusion with deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the operation, tympanic temperature, rectal temperature and SEP were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the rectal temperature fell to 20 degrees C, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was done and retrograde cerebral perfusion was started through SVC venous cannula, at the rate of 200-300 ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During cerebral perfusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15544">PGE1</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">Mannitol</z:chebi>, Solumedrol were administered and defroxamine as radical scavenger was injected before reperfusion for protection of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of retrograde cerebral perfusion was from 28 min to 67 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(mean 42.8 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the retrograde cerebral perfusion, cerebral embolization was prevented and good operative field without cannulation was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 13 patients, 3 patients were died of intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were alive and recovery of consciousness was complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, retrograde cerebral perfusion method is very simple and useful for the operation of aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
