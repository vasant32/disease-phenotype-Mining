<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 16-year-old boy developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002427'>motor aphasia</z:hpo> and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> after head trauma caused during Rugby football club activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About 2 hours after trauma, these neurological deficits improved dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT scan on admission revealed no abnormal finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But, on the next day, CT scan revealed an irregular low density area at the left basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed a slight narrowing at the left carotid siphon, severe stenosis at M1 portion of the left middle cerebral artery with vasospasm of its distal branches and occlusion of the left anterior temporal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery was intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the patient recovered from the right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> almost fully and was discharged after 1 month with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002442'>dyscalculia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three months later, follow-up angiography disclosed stenosis of the left M1 portion but the narrowing of the carotid siphon and vasospasm of the peripheral branches of the middle cerebral artery had been normalized, and the anterior temporal artery was recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the occlusion is classified into 4 causes, 1) embolism from internal carotid artery, 2) vasospasm, 3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, 4) dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the demonstration of this by angiography is difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our case, the injury of the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery, which caused the intimal injury, spasm or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, might have happened and resulted in embolisation and recanalization of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
