<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Different frequencies of asymptomatic Doppler embolic signals have been reported in studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There has been concern that different criteria for identification may account for some of this variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A previous reproducibility study between two centers found good agreement, but no studies among large numbers of centers have been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed an international reproducibility study among nine centers, each of which had published recent studies of embolic signal detection in peer-reviewed journals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Each center performed blinded analysis of a taped audio Doppler signal composed of transcranial Doppler middle cerebral artery recordings from 6 patients with symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exact time of any embolic signal was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six centers also measured the intensity increase of any embolic signals detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was determined by a method based on the proportion of specific agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven centers reported between 39 and 55 signals, but one center reported 142 embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probability of agreement between observers was .678, which rose to .791 when the data from the highest reporting center were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Introducing a decibel threshold resulted in a significant increase in the probability of agreement; a decibel threshold of &gt; 7 dB resulted in a probability of agreement of .902 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intensity measurements made by different centers were usually highly correlated, but this was not always the case, and 3 of the 15 correlations were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The absolute values of the intensities measured varied between centers by as much as 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although most centers report similar numbers of embolic signals, some use less specific criteria and report more events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The use of a decibel threshold improves reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, intensity thresholds developed by one center cannot be directly transferred without validation to another center; differing methods of measurement are being used, and this results in different intensity values for the same embolic signals, even when the same equipment is used </plain></SENT>
