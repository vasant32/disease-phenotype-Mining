<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Timely intravenous administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (alteplase, rTPA) to patients with evolving <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> improves neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to compare the effects of rTPA and recombinant staphylokinase (Sak), a highly fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent, in an experimental model of rabbit embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Groups of 5 to 12 rabbits were given intravenous saline or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and aspirin with, in addition, either Sak (1 or 2 mg/kg infused over 30 minutes or 2 mg/kg injected over 1 minute) or rTPA (3 or 6 mg/kg infused over 30 minutes or 6 mg/kg injected over 1 minute) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infusions were started 15 minutes after selective injection of standardized 125I-fibrin labeled rabbit plasma clots into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean clot lysis over 60 minutes increased from 3.8% after saline to between 27% and 44% after Sak regimens (P = .0001 versus control) and to between 15% and 34% after rTPA regimens (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median volume of the ischemic lesion at 5 hours decreased from 190 mm3 after saline to between 11 and 17 mm3 after Sak (P = .02) and to between 0.5 to 54 mm3 after rTPA (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean neurological impairment at 5 hours (on a scale of 0 to 3) decreased from 2.3 after saline to between 1.3 to 1.6 after Sak (P = .003) and to between 1.1 to 1.9 after rTPA (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the highest doses used, fibrinogen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was marginal with Sak but total with rTPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Marked prolongation of car puncture and cuticle <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times was only observed after bolus administration of rTPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present rabbit model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, Sak was significantly more fibrin-specific than rTPA and at least as effective in lysing arterial emboli and limiting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
