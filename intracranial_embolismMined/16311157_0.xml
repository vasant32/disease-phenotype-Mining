<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We encountered a woman who experienced a transient right acronumbness followed by a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and conscious change concurrently </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography disclosed right axillary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at the proximal portion without collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardioaortic survey and coagulation profile were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombectomy was done and radial flow was corrected rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-thrombectomic heparinization did not bring complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a distant embolism from peripheral artery at the upper limb should be alerted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A lower density of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and no-flow condition in her occluded axillary artery may facilitate the upstreamed embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Heparinization, under closed monitor, is not contraindicated for preventing restenosis after thrombectomy in case of hemorrhagic transformation in brain </plain></SENT>
