<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The consensus is increasing that diffuse microembolism is the most important cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery were investigated by transcranial Doppler sonography in 26 patients regarding the effect of continuous and pulsatile perfusion during extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The quotient of systolic and diastolic flow velocity was significantly increased in patients with pulsatile perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal high-frequent Doppler-signals were registered in 8 patients using pulsatile perfusion without diastolic basic flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the other patients in whom continuous pump flow was applied (13) did not reveal any signs of hemodynamic disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group treated with pulsatile perfusion the systolic pressures before and behind the oxygenator were significantly increased in patients with high-frequent Doppler-signals which are likely to be caused by gaseous microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigating one type of four different oxygenators no cerebral hemodynamic alterations were recorded even during pulsatile perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of membrane oxygenators and arterial filters during pulsatile perfusion cannot completely prevent the occurrence of gaseous microemboli; their principle causes are supposed to be the level of perfusion pressure, the flow velocity and the design of oxygenator </plain></SENT>
