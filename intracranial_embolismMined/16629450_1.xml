<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 63-year-old case of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> with recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolisms</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was admitted to the hospital because she suffered a visual symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diagnosed a left vertebral artery (VA) dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed the string sign on the left VA supporting the evidence of dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, after DSA, multiple brain embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She was treated with anti-platelet drug (<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> ozagrel), then, recanalization of the pseudo-lumen at the dissecting lesion was observed by MRI examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-platelet medicine (cilostazol) was taken for preventing reattack although the dissecting lesion was not closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following 4 weeks, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolisms</z:e> were observed in the posterior circulation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed a dilated pseudo-lumen at the dissecting lesion with recurrent VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This time, she was treated only with free radical scavenger (edarabone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the occlusion of the dissected VA was observed, she started to take anti-platelet medicine again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is generally accepted to use anti-platelet drug or anti-coagulant drug as a treatment of VA dissection causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, it should be assessed more carefully in cases showing recanalization of the pseudo-lumen as observed in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatments should be taken into consideration at the early stage, especially for the cases presenting fragile dissecting lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further study need to decide the effective treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
