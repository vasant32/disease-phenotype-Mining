<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Based on previous studies comparing different recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) doses, we performed a clinical trial with 0.6 mg/kg, which is lower than the internationally approved dosage of 0.9 mg/kg, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of alteplase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> for the Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label trial was designed with a target sample size of 100 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end points were the proportion of patients with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 1 at 3 months and the incidence of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (sICH) within 36 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thresholds for these end points were determined by calculating 90% CIs of weighted averages derived from published reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protocol was defined according to the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS) rt-PA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> study with slight modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 103 patients enrolled, 38 had an mRS of 0 to 1 at 3 months; this proportion (36.9%) exceeded the predetermined threshold of 33.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>sICH within 36 hours occurred in 6 patients; this incidence (5.8%) was lower than the threshold of 9.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients receiving 0.6 mg/kg alteplase, the outcome and the incidence of sICH were comparable to published data for 0.9 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that alteplase, when administered at 0.6 mg/kg to Japanese patients, might offer a clinical efficacy and safety that are compatible with data reported in North America and the European Union for a 0.9 mg/kg dose </plain></SENT>
