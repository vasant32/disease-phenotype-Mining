<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The standard protocol for RLS detection was followed and expanded after the initial injection in the supine position to the right lateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">decubitus</z:e>, upright sitting, and sitting with right lateral leaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and any subjective complaints were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in body position and additional agitated saline injections were tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>Right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) was detected in 35% of patients (n = 55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the initial supine testing was negative, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequent positions/injections were also negative for RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, if the supine injection was positive for RLS, the change in body positions increased the microbubble (microB) count in eight of 19 (42%) RLS-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean microB count in RLS-positive patients was 20 (95% CI: 9-32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of three additional body positions increased the microB count to 73 (95% CI: 13-132) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The highest microB yield was achieved in the upright sitting position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the safety and feasibility of the expanded TCD protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If the initial supine Valsalva-aided contrast TCD test is negative, there may be no need to study the patient in additional positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, if microB are detected in the supine position, additional testing for RLS in alternative positions may be found to be worthwhile </plain></SENT>
