<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 440 major head and neck operations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in which the carotid artery was exposed, 20 (4.5%) patients suffered a carotid rupture or had the vessel ligated just prior to rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the typical patient and his management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 20 patients, five died as a direct result of rupture or ligation, ten survived rupture and/or ligation with neurologic sequelae, and five survived rupture and/or ligation without neurologica sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the ten patients with neurologic problems, four had immediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and six had delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, ie, these occurred greater than eight hours after ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients who required carotid artery ligation, separate from the previously mentioned group, received 5,000 units of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> subcutaneously every 12 hours in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these seven patients, one died immediately postoperatively, and six survived without any neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We discuss the cause of delayed neurologic problems and the rationale for the use of low-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
