<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We clinically investigates 45 episodes (36 cases) of definite IE that were experienced from January 1985 to March 1997 at a community hospital, Okinawa Chubu Hospital, Okinawa, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regarding age, prior dental procedure, causative organisms and sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, analyses and comparison were performed on a total of 94 episodes, by adding another 49 episodes of IE that were experienced between 1977 and 1984 at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 47 years and majority of patients in the recent 12 years were older than 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 94 episodes was 20%, while that of recent 45 cases was 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> episodes had history of recent dental treatment but significance of the finding remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alpha streptococci were most common (33%) and Staphylococcus aureus was the second most common organism (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> episodes were culture-negative and there was a statistically significant difference in the histories of prior antibiotic therapy between culture-negative and culture-positive episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, 27% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> episodes involved mitral valves, while 24% involved aortic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prosthetic valves were involved in 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight % of the recent episodes had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, 98% had <z:mp ids='MP_0006114'>cardiac murmurs</z:mp> and 27% had characteristic mucocutaneous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> was the most common complication (27%) and half of the cases with prosthetic valve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral embolism</z:e> was most frequently seen among the major arterial embolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results were similar to those which were previously reported from other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We should have a high index of suspicion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> whenever we see patients who present various clinical manifestations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of which origin remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Willingness to obtain blood culture before starting antibiotics is most important </plain></SENT>
