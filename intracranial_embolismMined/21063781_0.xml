<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) using 64-row multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) and to examine its association with conventional risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We consecutively enrolled 175 patients (66 ± 13 years, 50% men) suspected to have had embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> clinically or radiologically, and underwent 64-row MSCT to evaluate for a possible cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) and coronary CT angiography (CCTA) were concurrently performed based on standard scanning protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> or documented CAD, and those with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic plaques were indentified in 105 (60%) individuals; 37 (21%) had occult CAD of ≥50% diameter stenosis on CCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with and without ≥50% occult CAD on CCTA had similar prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty out of 175 (17%) individuals with ≥50% occult CAD would have missed further cardiac testing based on the American Heart association and the American <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Association guideline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, these numbers would be reduced to 2% (4/175) using CACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression analysis, only CACS independently predicted the presence ≥50% occult CAD evidenced by CCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subclinical CAD, including ≥50% stenotic disease, is highly prevalent in patients who had suffered a suspected embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The current guideline for further cardiac testing may have limited value to identify patients with ≥50% CAD in this patient population, which can be improved by adopting CACS </plain></SENT>
