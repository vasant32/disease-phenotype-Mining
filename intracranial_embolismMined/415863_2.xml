<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An analog scaler was placed behind the PM-tubes to reduce dead-time loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The input pulse rate was doubled to counteract the effect of scaling on counting statistics, and the gamma emission was filtered through 1 mm of brass to increase the fraction of the integral count rate within the 40% window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this way the 31 keV peak disappears, and Compton scatter and disturbing coincidences are markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This improves spatial resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The flow parameters are imaged regionally in 3 X 3 mm2 matrix elements after flat field correction and smoothing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The matrix is 64 X 64 interpolated to 128 X 128 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient studies emphasized the importance of imaging the distribution of perfused and nonperfused tissue in cases of infarctions, dilacerations, etc., where angiography and conventional brain scanning may often be negative </plain></SENT>
