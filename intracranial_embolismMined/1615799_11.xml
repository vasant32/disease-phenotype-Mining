<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to define the risk factors for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> in patients with recently diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied 63 consecutive patients with symptomatic nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and performed a clinical and noninvasive cardiac, peripheral vascular, and neurologic evaluation that included two-dimensional echocardiography, 24-hour Holter monitoring, and computed tomographic brain scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with predisposing clinical conditions for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> (valvular heart or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (sick sinus disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo>, or thyroid dysfunction) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At entry 34 patients had idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and 29 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had a recent systemic embolic complication: nine had a recent occlusive nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and three had peripheral systemic emboli that required surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, five patients had evidence of old <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> on the computed tomographic scan (group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients had no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of univariate analysis showed that patients in group 1 were older (72 +/- 9 vs 63 +/- 13 years, p less than 0.05), had a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (70% vs 35%, p less than 0.01), and had an increased left atrial diameter (4.1 +/- 0.7 vs 3.6 +/- 0.5 cm, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and left atrial enlargement on two-dimensional echocardiography were significant independent risk factors for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> in patients with symptomatic nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
