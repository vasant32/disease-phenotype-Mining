<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The former is defined by spatiotemporal variations of luminance and the latter by spatiotemporal variations in other image attributes, such as contrast or depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe two neurological patients with focal unilateral lesions whose contrasting perceptual deficits on psychophysical tasks of "first-order" and "second-order" motion are related to the maps of the human brain established by functional neuroimaging and gross anatomical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a relatively fine-grained neocortical parcellation method applied to high-resolution MRI scans of the patients' brains to illustrate a subtle, yet highly specific dissociation in the visual motion system in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the two motion systems are mediated by regionally separate mechanisms from an early stage of cortical processing </plain></SENT>
