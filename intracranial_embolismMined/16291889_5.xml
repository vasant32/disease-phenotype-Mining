<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study investigated (a) the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with aortic atheroma would show comparable atherosclerotic changes in the carotid arteries, which are easily accessible for ultrasound evaluation and (b) the possibility of carotid duplex sonography as a replacement for transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for the exclusion or prediction of relevant aortic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 301 consecutive patients (mean age 62 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, two dimensional ultrasound measurements were taken of common carotid artery intima media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and maximal plaque area (PA) and the local degree of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maximal aortic wall thickness (AWT) was assessed by TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> &lt; or =0.9 mm yielded a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.8% for exclusion of aortic atheromas &gt; or =4 mm and an NPV of 100% for the exclusion of aortic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, positive predictive value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> &gt;0.9 mm was low (29.6%), increasing only slightly in the presence of carotid plaques (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence of aortic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> was significantly higher with &gt; or =50% compared with &lt;50% ICA stenosis (11.3% v 3.9%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and PA correlated moderately with AWT (r = 0.47, r = 0.53, respectively; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and peripheral artery disease, increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, and ICA stenosis &gt; or =50% were independently related to AWT &gt; or =4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high NPV of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid ultrasound does not support routine TEE for the exclusion of complex aortic plaques as a high risk source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, particularly in those with ICA stenosis &gt; or =50%, TEE should be performed to exclude an additional high risk source for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
