<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) detected by transcranial Doppler represent ongoing embolisms, but the lack of reliable data about its clinical relevance hinders its widespread use in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively monitored 114 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The signals on digital audio tape were analyzed by an independent observer who was blinded to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed-up for the occurrence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) in the indexed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was detected in 25 (22%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was 18 (range, 1 to 102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were more common in patients with severe stenosis (10/21, 48%) than in those with mild-moderate stenosis (4/26, 15%) (Pearson chi2 P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-up for a mean of 13.6 months (range, 1 to 32), 12 (12%) patients had further ischemic events (10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) in the affected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> region during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among these, 7 (58%) had recurred within 1 month (1 recurred within 1 week, the other 6 patients had recurrences in week 3 or 4 after discharge), 3 within 6 months, 1 within 6 to 12 months, and the remaining 1 recurred after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was the only predictor of a further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> by Cox regression (adjusted odds ratio, 8.45; 95% CI, 1.69 to 42.22; P=0.01) even after controlling for age, sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, smoking, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> predicts further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This procedure should be considered as part of routine investigation and might identify a group of patients who are most likely to benefit from antithrombotic treatment </plain></SENT>
