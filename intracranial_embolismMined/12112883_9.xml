<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The retina provides a unique observatory for the study of emboli, which may occur either directly or indirectly via collaterals to the ophthalmic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systems under development for cerebral protection differ in their capacity to trap small emboli and in their protection of the collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 118 sequential patients undergoing carotid stenting using fundoscopy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> angiography, and visual field examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The site and size of emboli was assessed, and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated using distal protection during carotid stent implantation: 38 patients with the Théron system (using routine flushing toward the external carotid) and 80 patients with the Percusurge system (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> embolization occurred in 6 of the 118 patients (4%), of whom 2 were symptomatic (1.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the Théron system, 5 of 38 patients (13.2%) had emboli while 1 of 80 (1.25%) had emboli using the Percusurge system (P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptoms occurred only with emboli &gt;20 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolization is uncommon during carotid stenting, but is more likely when external to internal carotid collaterals are not protected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protection system designs should take into consideration the existence of collaterals and the need to protect against smaller sized emboli, which may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> circulation </plain></SENT>
