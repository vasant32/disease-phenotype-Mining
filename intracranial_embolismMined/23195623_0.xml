<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The generation of emboli during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is profoundly affected by the hemodynamic properties of the aortic cannula used in the current study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current work was to numerically investigate the hemodynamic efficiency and feasibility of a novel, backward suction cannula (BSC), designed to drastically reduce the potential risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> (CEP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In line with the standard cannulae, the BSC provides oxygenated blood from the CPB machine through its primary lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the unique feature of the BSC lies in its secondary lumen, which is used to suck blood and embolic matter back from the surgical field to the CPB machine for filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis included a numerical investigation of the hemodynamic characteristics of 44 different models, encompassing various anatomic orientations, cannula types, cannula orientations and flow conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic efficacy and CEP were assessed via trajectories of particle released from the surgical region, while the cannula feasibility was evaluated through potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e> (AP) and index for <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> (IH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences between the investigated cannulae in terms of these measures were tested using analyses of variance tests (ANOVAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that the BSC exhibited a significant improvement of the cannula performance in terms of CEP with no significant change in the risk for other hemodynamic complications, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e> (AP and IH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the advantageous use of the BSC in the clinical setting for its potential to diminish the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, which presents the most pertinent cause of noncardiac complications following open heart surgery </plain></SENT>
