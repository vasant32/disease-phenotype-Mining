<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A pathological examination was performed on normotensive rats (NTR) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) following bilateral common carotid artery ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After ligation, diffuse and extensive cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the carotid artery territory occurred frequently in SHR, while NTR occasionally had well-circumscribed small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The posterior communicating arteries, which are the major anastomotic channels connecting the carotid and vertebrobasilar systems, did not show any anomalies and were well developed in SHR and NTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular changes secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, such as fibrinoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or thickening of the wall, were not observed in SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the paucity of structural difference of the blood vessels, the more diffuse and extensive cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in SHR after carotid occlusion were attributed to the hemodynamic difference rather than the morphological difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the present experiment suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> per se, i.e., hemodynamic factors, may be operative for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
