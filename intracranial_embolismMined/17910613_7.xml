<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and is released excessively during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> therapy will require combinations of drug classes, because no single drug class has yet been proven efficacious in human beings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to assess whether N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (MK-801) treatment can improve recovery from ischaemic brain injury and whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, a PPAR-gamma ligand, can increase its neuroprotective effect in an embolic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was induced in rats by embolizing a preformed clot into the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg, intravenously) were injected immediately after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours later, the brains were removed, sectioned and stained with triphenyltetrazolum <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> and analysed by a commercial image processing software programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and MK-801 alone or in combination decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 49.16%, 50.26% and 81.32%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the combination therapy significantly decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when compared to any drug used alone (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MK-801 reduced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> by 68% compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05), but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or combination did not show any significant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The drugs alone or in combination also demonstrated improved neurological function, but combination therapy was more effective on neurological deficits improving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the combination of MK-801 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> is more neuroprotective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> than given alone; this effect perhaps represents a possible additive effect in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
