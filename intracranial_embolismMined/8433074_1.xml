<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repeated assessments for detection of AE were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were non-randomly allocated to either no <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, low-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or high-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LVT was found in 25 (26.9%) of 93 patients with technically satisfactory echocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) wall motion impairment (P = 0.0017) and treatment with either <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or low-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (P = 0.0019) were independent predictors of LVT formation </plain></SENT>
