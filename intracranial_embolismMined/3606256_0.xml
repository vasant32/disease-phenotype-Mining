<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pump was introduced into the thoracic aorta at the level of the eight thoracic vertebra in 11 canine right-heart bypass preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heart rate (110 beats per minute), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume (20 ml), and mean arterial pressure (80 or 100 mm Hg) were precisely controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pump ejection volume was adjusted to equal 1 time or 2 times the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume of the dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 20-ml ejection led to an 11% reduction in left atrial pressure, an 11% reduction in peak left ventricular pressure, and a 20% reduction in tension time index (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p less than .05 at a mean arterial pressure of 80 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systolic shortening (ultrasonic crystals) increased by 5% (p less than .05 at a mean arterial pressure of 80 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 40-ml pump ejection led to an 11% reduction in mean left atrial pressure, a 17% reduction in peak left ventricular pressure, and a 21% reduction in tension time index (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p less than .05 at a mean arterial pressure of 80 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The systolic shortening increased by 15% (p less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To assess the relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, albumin spheres (40 to 60 micrograms) labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33371">technetium-99</z:chebi> were injected into the pump chamber in 5 dogs (40-ml ejection, 2.1 +/- 0.1 times the dog's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
