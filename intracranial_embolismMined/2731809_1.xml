<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The embolized rats had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired memory</z:e> and learning ability in the radial maze task; these were demonstrated by a decrease in correct responses and an increase in total errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, the rats showed severe impairment of working memory, as shown by a marked increase in the numbers of re-entries into the arm that had been already visited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Idebenone (30 mg/kg, p.o.) exerted marked ameliorating effects on the impairment in the embolized rats: the drug significantly increased the correct responses and decreased the errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeloxazine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> also improved the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in the embolized rats, as shown by a reduction of the errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ameliorating effects of these drugs may be due mainly to improvement of hypofunctions of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that idebenone and indeloxazine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> may have ameliorating actions on impairment of memory and learning induced by brain hypofunction, and they suggest that the action of idebenone is more potent than that of indeloxazine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
