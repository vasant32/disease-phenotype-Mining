<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed trans-ventricular mitral commissurotomy (TVMC) either as an isolated procedure in the second trimester, or in combination with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011410'>Cesarian section</z:hpo> at term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed our experience with TVMC during pregnancy and formulated a protocol for its management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between January 1987 and April 2002, fifty one patients underwent TVMC for critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 38 patients, elective TVMC was performed during the second trimester, while in 12, it was performed as an initial procedure along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011410'>Cesarian section</z:hpo> at term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had an emergency TVMC in the second trimester when she presented with intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no maternal mortalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients who developed post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> were managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another two patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> recovered completely without any neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was only one fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a patient where TVMC was performed as an emergency procedure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TVMC in pregnancy is a safe, cost effective alternative in critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> complicating pregnancy </plain></SENT>
