<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The experience was accumulated by the leading heart surgeons of the country from 1984 to 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total number of complications was 77 (5.4%), 23 (1.6%) of them were fetal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The least number of complications (1.88%) occurred in catheter-balloon valvuloplasty in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo>, 1% were fetal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> were encountered in 11.3% of cases, 4.8% were fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The greatest number of complications (44) were recorded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> with a relatively low mortality (2.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors distinguish unspecific complications connected with the use of standard diagnostic catheters and instruments, and specific complications linked with the use of balloon catheters or caused by the course of the disease, and the character of the valve affection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the result of analysis of the causes of complications, the authors suggest a system for preparation of patients for operation and the principles of its safe accomplishment and describe the order of the acts undertaken by the surgeon for the management of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of complications of catheter-balloon valvuloplasty demonstrates the efficacy and mild injurious character of this method, which makes it possible to rank it among the generally accepted cardiosurgical methods for the correction of heart valvular stenoses </plain></SENT>
