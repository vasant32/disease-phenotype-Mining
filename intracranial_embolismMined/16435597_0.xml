<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The unpredictable outcome and the period during which the complication arises make treatment difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the tolerance and efficacy of the association of long-term <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and oral anticoagulation, as recommended in this indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients undergoing mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis between June 1999 and July 2001 were systematically included and studied by transoesophageal echocardiography in the immediate postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those with non-obstructive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at least 5 mm in size were treated by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and oral coagulation until the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> disappeared on transoesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fourteen patients undergoing 120 mitral valve replacements (6 reoperations) underwent transoesophageal echocardiography and non-obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> measuring at least 5 mm were found on 26 occasions (21.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and oral coagulation was maintained for 7 to 115 days (average 20 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No thromboembolic or haemorrhagic complications and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients were treated with danaparoid and oral anticoagulation because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> before the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients died during follow-up (average 49 months); there were 4 recurrent non-obstructive thromboses, three of which were complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> with no sequellae in the first 8 months, again treated effectively with the association of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>; two cerebral embolic events without sequellae were observed without a demonstrable non-obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> on transoesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that the association of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> seems well tolerated and effective in this small population and this would justify a large scale clinical trial </plain></SENT>
