<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of these 44 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> presenting within six months of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microfilariasis was the most likely cause of the raised total eosinophil in these 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, the raised eosinophil count we returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by the use of diethylcarbamazine (Banocide) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 13 were followed up and eight of them (73%) developed clinical features of cardiac constriction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Limited cardiac catheterisation studies in six of the patients showed evidence of constriction or of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of these eight patients were indistinguishable from those found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006685'>endomyocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This disease was further suggested by recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in one, and a large <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> in another; and it was also present in the one patient to come to necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, microfilaria-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, when high, is frequently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> which appears to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006685'>endomyocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> many months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> has returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
