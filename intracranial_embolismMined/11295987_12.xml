<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neurologic complications after cardiac surgery include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More precise neuroimaging of patients with these complications may lead to a better understanding of the etiology and treatment of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the pattern of ischemic changes on diffusion- and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI, and MRPI, respectively) in patients with neurologic complications after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> records were reviewed of our patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the previous year who also underwent postoperative DWI or MRPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic symptoms, vascular studies, and the pattern of ischemic changes were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions were classified as having a territorial, watershed, or lacunar pattern of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with multiple territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in differing vascular distributions that were not explained by occlusive vascular lesions were classified as having multiple emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent DWI and 4 underwent MRPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found in 10 of 14 patients by DWI as compared with 5 of 12 patients by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (associated with focal neurologic deficits in 4), 4 with focal deficits alone, and 2 with either fluctuating symptoms or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, 7 of 8 had patterns of infarction suggestive of multiple emboli, including 3 of 4 patients with no focal neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several patients had combined watershed and multiple embolic patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Findings of MRPI studies were abnormal in 2 of 4 patients, showing diffusion-perfusion mismatch; both patients had either fluctuating deficits or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and their conditions improved with blood pressure manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with neurologic symptoms after cardiac surgery, DWI is more sensitive to ischemic change than computed tomographic scanning and can demonstrate patterns of infarction that may help us understand etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most common pattern was multiple embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Preliminary experience with MRPI suggests that some patients have persistent diffusion-perfusion mismatch after surgery and may benefit from therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
