<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) studies have indicated that 10-40% of patients have silent embolism during neurointerventional procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, lesion patterns of the embolisms have not been adequately investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DWI was taken within 7 days before and 48 h after cerebral angioplasty and stent procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New lesions on the follow-up DWI were analyzed in the non-treated arterial territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the arterial territories, supratentorial lesions were classified into cortical lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical lesions were subdivided into cortical border zone and cortical proper lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Subcortical lesions</z:e> were divided into deep perforator and internal border zone lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infratentorial lesions were divided into brainstem and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 72 patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 223 new DWI lesions (1-23 lesions) in the non-treated arterial territories of 37 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 154 cortical lesions, 45 cerebellar lesions, 21 subcortical lesions and 3 brainstem lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the distribution pattern of cortical lesions showed that 88 of 154 lesions were located at the cortical border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e>, 13 of 21 lesions were located at the internal border zone area, within the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata and centrum ovale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only 4 lesions were located at the deep perforator territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Infratentorial lesions were mostly located at the cerebellar hemisphere (45/48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most lesions were tiny <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (&lt;5 mm diameter); 7 of 223 lesions were &gt;10 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interventional-angiography-related microembolisms mostly lodge in the cerebral cortical border zone area and cerebellar hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Microembolisms to the deep perforating artery territory are distinctly rare </plain></SENT>
