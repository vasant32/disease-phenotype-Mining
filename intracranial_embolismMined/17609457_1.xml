<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Percutaneous RF ablation of 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo> in 12 dogs was performed under computed tomography (CT) guidance with use of impedance-controlled devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The common carotid artery was continuously monitored in each animal during RF ablation with duplex Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals underwent brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging shortly after RF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delayed brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (5-8 days after RF ablation) was performed in eight animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examinations included diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were euthanized 3-11 days after RF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brain was harvested from each animal and examined by an experienced veterinary pathologist for evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RF ablation was technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microbubbles were detected in the carotid artery in two animals (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> and delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies demonstrated no evidence of ischemic brain injury in any of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gross and histopathologic assessment of brain tissue also demonstrated no ischemic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During RF ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo>, microbubbles are detected in the carotid arteries in a small number of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These microbubbles are too few and too small to be detected by CT imaging of the brain and do not cause ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
