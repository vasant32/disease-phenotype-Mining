<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper presents the results of intraoperative median nerve SEP monitoring in 205 successive patients undergoing isolated carotid endarterectomy (CE) (N = 172) or CE followed by coronary bypass (CBP) and/or vascular replacement (VR) (N = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The left and right median nerves were alternately stimulated and recordings performed on 4 channels: cervical, ipsi- and contralateral parietal, and frontal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SEPs were qualitatively rated in terms of mild, moderate, or severe ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SEP abnormalities were subdivided into 5 categories as a function of their relationships with intraoperative events: no alterations (67.3%), early or late SEP alterations after carotid cross-clamping (15.6%), SEP alterations after a drop in blood pressure (occurring outside of or within the cross-clamping period) (15.1%), SEP alterations of a most likely embolic origin (2.4%), SEP changes after head positioning (1%), and SEP changes after a modification of the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> regimen (1.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only moderate to severe SEP alterations occurring soon after carotid cross-clamping justified shunt installation in 16% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SEP alterations after a drop in blood pressure were reversed merely by restoring blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurological outcome was uneventful in 94.2% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 patients who developed neurological sequellae, only one case presented transient sequellae after isolated CE without SEP changes while most cases either had undergone combined CE and CBP and/or VR (6 cases) or had presented SEP alterations of embolic origin (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that our system of qualitative rating of SEPs proved very sensitive to intraoperative hemodynamic disturbances or macroembolisms </plain></SENT>
