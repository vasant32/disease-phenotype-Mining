<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Some patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> are denied operation because severe occlusive lesions in other extra-cranial arteries may be inappropriately interpreted as constituting an unacceptable surgical risk, or because the lesion is so distal as to make its removal hazardous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Failure of endarterectomy is usually due to incomplete removal of the lesion or to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> upon the frayed intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such lesions require excellent visualization and meticulous surgical technique -- not always possible with a shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 130 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed under general anesthesia, EEG changes consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> appeared in only nine (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients required a shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EEG tracings were obtained during endarterectomy despite contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of these patients had a neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuous EEG monitoring is a reliable method of detecting changes in cerebral perfusion, permits a more meticulous endarterectomy in high-lying lesions without a shunt, and extends operability in high risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiographical findings may be an unreliable predictor concerning risk of endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
