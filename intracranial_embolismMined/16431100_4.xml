<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Uncomplicated spinal anesthesia and satisfactory surgical anesthesia were obtained; no <z:chebi fb="35" ids="35717">sedatives</z:chebi> were used and the patient was awake and alert and tolerating the procedure well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately following infant and placental delivery (approximately 25 min after the spinal <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> was induced) the patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of markedly decreased mental status, profound ventricular ectopy and labile blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The event lasted for approximately 10 min with spontaneous resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic status returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by the end of the surgery, but electrocardiogram findings in the immediate postoperative period were consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> and serial cardiac troponin levels confirmed myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On postoperative day 1, an echocardiogram demonstrated the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
