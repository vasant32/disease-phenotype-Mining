<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF), Oxygen Extraction Fraction, and Oxygen utilization (CMRO2) have been studied in 15 patients before and After Extra-Intracranial Arterial bypass (EIAB), using PET and 150 steady-State Inhalation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had carotid artery obstructive lesions and the last one a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the whole group of patients, both CBF and CMRO2 increased significantly on both cerebral hemispheres after the EIAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect was more marked in patients with extensive occlusive disease of neck vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This metabolic improvement afforded by EIAB in our patients suggests that long-standing hemodynamic failure may induce a metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> that's still potentially reversible by surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, improvement of focal CBF abnormalities depends, in our patients, upon the preoperative coupling of CBF-CMRO2 (mainly misery perfusion syndrome) as reported earlier </plain></SENT>
