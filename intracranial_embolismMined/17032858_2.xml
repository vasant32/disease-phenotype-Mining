<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance and possible underlying mechanism were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-three consecutive patients with a total of 100 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, treated by endosaccular packing, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with balloon assistance, and the remaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated without balloon assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent cranial CT just before and immediately after the endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the post-treatment CT showed any new finding, an immediate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and a repeat CT 4-6 hours after the initial posttreatment CT were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several parameters were investigated related to the presence of cortical hyperdensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cranial CT showed focal cortical hyperdensity following the treatment of 40/74 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (54%) with balloon remodeling and 9/26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (34.6%) without balloon assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of these patients were symptomatic, and cortical hyperdensity resolved in the repeat CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant relationship was observed between the presence of this finding and the total amount of contrast material, microcatheter time, number of balloon inflations, and total balloon inflation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Immediate postembolization CT may show focal cortical hyperdensity following uneventful endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment, most likely caused by blood-brain barrier disruption resulting in accumulation of contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The hyperdensity was more frequent when balloon assistance was used but was also seen in the patients with no balloon use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is important to differentiate this clinically insignificant finding from possible <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, which would affect patients' immediate postprocedural medical management </plain></SENT>
