<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic (US) signals indicating cerebral microembolism have characteristic but complex features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors wanted to assess the agreement among human observers and test the feasibility of an automated detection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Automated on-line detection of cerebral microemboli was accomplished by employing real-time overlapping Fourier transform and artificial neural network technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using long-term transcranial Doppler US recordings of the middle cerebral artery in consecutive cerebrovascular and cardiac patients, the method was evaluated in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of specific agreement (ps) among four experienced investigators identifying cerebral microemboli was high (mean ps, 0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Agreement among the neural network and the human observers was only slightly less (mean ps, 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The technique allows highly reliable on-line evaluation of transcranial Doppler US recordings across multiple centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It obviates time-consuming analyses by human observers </plain></SENT>
