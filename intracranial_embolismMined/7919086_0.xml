<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 7,893 men aged 45 to 68 and free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at baseline examination (1965-68), 587 developed first episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during 24 years of follow-up through 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparing the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes before and after the advent of CT scanning in 1976, there was an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> (67% to 74%), a decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (9% to 6%) and unknown type (7% to 2%), and little change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (18% to 19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence declined from 5.1 to 2.4 per 1,000 person years between 1969 and 1988, with a mean annual rate of decline of 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality in the target population (examined and nonexamined men combined) also declined markedly, at a rate similar to that reported for U.S. white men of comparable ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The one-month case fatality ratio fell dramatically in hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (75% to 29%) and only slightly (13% to 11%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relationships between a variety of biological, sociocultural and lifestyle factors and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were evaluated by means of bivariate and multivariate Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was the strongest and most consistent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other risk factors showed inconsistent patterns of association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
