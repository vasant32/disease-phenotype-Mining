<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardioversion (CV) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> can cause arterial embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effective anticoagulation clearly reduces the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In practice, in every third case anticoagulation is not in line with the recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simplification can be achieved, and time gained, by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) due to the shorter anticoagulation period prior to CV, and by use of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) for anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As yet little data is available on LMWH in cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this cohort study was to investigate the administration of a LMWH in this indication under everyday clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 125 patients treated as inpatients for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or -flutter received the LMWH Fragmin (dalteparin 2 x 100 anti-Xa units/kg, maximum dosage 2 x 10,000 anti-Xa units subcutaneously) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the presence of a relevant indication, TEE-guided CV was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The application of dalteparin was terminated as soon as effective anticoagulation had been achieved from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">phenprocoumon</z:chebi> or once anticoagulation was no longer indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 125 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or -flutter received dalteparin for a median of 11 days (range of 3-41 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TEE was performed in 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients revealed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the left atrial appendage in the TEE, and one patient died from suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> over the further course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 124 patients, no thromboembolic event was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Successfully cardioverted were 26 of 34 patients (76%) who had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse effects did not ensue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Simple, well tolerated and effective anticoagulation is possible with dalteparin in TEE-guided CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Due to the methodic limitations of a cohort study and the low incidence of emboli, the efficacy of dalteparin in this indication needs to be further confirmed by prospective and randomized studies </plain></SENT>
