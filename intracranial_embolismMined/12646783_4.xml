<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> may be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> mainly in young and middle-aged patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study sought to further investigate the association between recent inflammatory events (IE) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> without age restriction and to determine the role of recent IE in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a case-control study with 93 consecutive hospitalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 200 (107 hospital and 93 community) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> IE, both infective and non-infective, occurring in the previous 30 days were assessed using a standard questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TOAST criteria were used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> IE in the previous 30 and 7 days were significantly and independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (37/93 vs. 47/200; OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.26-3.96 and 17/93 vs.16/200; OR 2.45, 95% IC 1.11-5.39, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratifying for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IE significantly and independently increased the risk of atherothrombotic (OR 5.72, 95% CI 2.14-15.25) and cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR 3.02, 95%CI 1.20-7.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> IE increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of atherothrombotic and cardioembolic type independently of other predisposing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Implications for daily clinical practice, in relation to prevention and treatment of IE in patients at risk, have to be explored </plain></SENT>
