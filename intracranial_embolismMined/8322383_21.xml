<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate a modified tissue-type plasminogen activator, SUN9216, and the combination of SUN9216 and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, vapiprost, in a rat middle cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Under anesthesia, the left middle cerebral artery was observed under an operation microscope without cutting the dura mater via a subtemporal craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Photoillumination (wave length, 540 nm) was applied to the middle cerebral artery, and then <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg) was administered intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reopening of the middle cerebral artery by SUN9216, injected 30 minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, was observed under an operation microscope for a 60-minute observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the operation, sections of the cerebrum were stained with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, and the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was analyzed by a computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combination of SUN9216 and vapiprost caused reopening of the middle cerebral artery in 58.8% of the rats, which was a greater percentage than that achieved with SUN9216 alone (31.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, saline did not cause reopening of the middle cerebral artery during the 60-minute observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in rats reperfused with SUN9216 was significantly reduced compared with that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The infarction area in rats treated with the combination of SUN9216 and vapiprost was reduced compared with that in rats treated with SUN9216 alone; this was the case whether or not the occlusion was reperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the time of reopening of the middle cerebral artery and area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single injection of SUN9216 was effective in recanalizing the vessel and reducing the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
