<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The goal of this study was to identify cerebral microemboli during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery and their potential relationship with visual alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler identified high-intensity transient signals (HITS) during surgery in both middle cerebral arteries, and ophthalmologic examination assessed their potential effects on the visual system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen children (age 13-17 years) undergoing surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> with spine curvature &gt;45 degrees were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HITS were identified in 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had a total count of &lt;15 HITS, but in the remaining two the count was unexpectedly high (63 and 265 HITS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography in these two patients indicated the presence of an atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Uneventful preoperative and postoperative visual function was found in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> and in another ophthalmologic complications developed not related to microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>Scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery is frequently associated with low counts of cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It appears that such low embolic counts have no effects on postoperative visual function as determined clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some patients may show high rates of microemboli, which may be related to the presence of right-to-left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001693'>cardiac shunts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The impact of these signals on brain function remains to be investigated </plain></SENT>
