<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of specific risk factors could help to improve the procedure and to reduce the overall risk of CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We addressed the role of carotid plaque echolucency as potential risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated carotid plaque echolucency by use of a computer-assisted measure of echogenicity, the gray scale median (GSM), in 31 consecutive patients with symptomatic high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> that were scheduled to undergo CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dual-frequency transcranial Doppler ultrasound was used to detect solid cerebral microemboli during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 27 of the 31 patients met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inclusion/exclusion criteria.Solid cerebral microemboli were detected during 17 of 27 CAS procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GSM of the target plaques was lower in subjects with intraprocedural embolism (37.9 +/- 20.8) than in those without (58.2 +/- 25.7) (p = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that the GSM that gave the greatest separation between plaques with a higher and a lower probability of intraprocedural embolism was 50: the proportion of subjects with intraprocedural embolism was 85% in CAS of echolucent plaques (GSM &lt;50) and 42% in CAS of echogenic plaques (GSM &gt; or =50) (p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CAS of both echolucent and echogenic carotid plaques may be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, particularly CAS of echolucent plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plaque echolucency alone does not reliably identify patients at particularly high risk of intraprocedural embolism, but should be considered as one of a broad panel of risk factors of CAS </plain></SENT>
