<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: At present, many surgeons prefer axillary artery cannulation because it facilitates antegrade cerebral perfusion and may diminish the risk of cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, axillary artery cannulation has not been established as a routine procedure because there is controversy about its clinical advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 111 patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> between January 2000 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right axillary artery was cannulated in 58 patients (group A) and the femoral artery was cannulated in 53 (group F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postoperative outcomes were retrospectively reviewed and compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 46 male and 65 female patients with a mean age of 58.9±13.1 years (range, 26 to 84 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of aortic replacement in both groups did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 8 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (7.2%) and 2 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up duration was 46.0±32.6 months (range, 1 month to 10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transient neurologic dysfunction was observed in 11 patients (19.0%) in group A and 14 patients (26.4%) in group F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 patients (9.9%) suffered from a permanent neurologic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early and delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were observed in 6 patients (10.3%) and 2 patients (3.4%), respectively, in group A as well as 2 patients (3.8%) and 1 patient (1.9%), respectively, in group F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences in the cannulation-related complications between both groups (3 in group A vs. 0 in group F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There were no differences in postoperative neurologic outcomes and cannulation-related complications according to the cannulation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cannulation site in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> should be carefully chosen on a case-by-case basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is important to also pay attention to the possibility of intraoperative malperfusion syndrome occurring and the subsequent need to change the cannulation site </plain></SENT>
