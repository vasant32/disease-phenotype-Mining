<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ex vivo effect of aspirin (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) on platelet aggregation, the platelet component of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, was studied at repeated intervals in a cohort of patients taking aspirin for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> prevention to define the maintenance of efficacy over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We administered increasing doses of aspirin (from 325 to 1300 mg/d) to patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and determined the extent of inhibition of platelet aggregation after 2 weeks and thereafter at approximately 6-month intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 33 months, 306 patients had platelet aggregation studies performed to define their initial response to <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 228 had complete and 78 had partial inhibition of platelet aggregation at initial testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date, 119 of those who had complete inhibition and 52 who had partial inhibition have undergone repeat testing at least once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At repeat testing 39 of the 119 (32.7%) with complete inhibition at initial testing had lost part of the antiplatelet effect of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and converted from complete to partial inhibition without change in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 52 with partial inhibition at initial testing, 35 achieved complete inhibition either by <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> dosage escalation (in 325 mg/d increments) or fluctuation of response at the same dosage, but 8 of those 35 (22.8%) had reverted to partial inhibition when tested again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 8.2% of patients ultimately exhibited <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> resistance to 1300 mg/d-8 of 52 (15.4%) with partial inhibition and 6 of 119 (5.0%) with complete inhibition at initial testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The antiplatelet (and presumably the antithrombotic) effect of a fixed dose of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> is not constant over time in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which increased dosage requirement or <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> resistance develops and the clinical significance of this development are currently undefined </plain></SENT>
