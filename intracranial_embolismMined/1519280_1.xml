<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Elevated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> and reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> may increase the risk of atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, but the metabolic mechanisms accounting for this relation are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The kinetic parameters of low density and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> were studied in nine subjects with atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> or identifiable (by noninvasive testing) extracranial occlusive disease and in 12 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autologous <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-125-labeled <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> were injected intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn 10 minutes after injection and periodically thereafter for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kinetic parameters were calculated from the decay curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-risk group showed significantly higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (p less than 0.05), total cholesterol (p less than 0.02), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fractional catabolic rate of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) and the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> rate higher (p less than 0.02) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-risk group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis (using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects) of serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> and their respective fractional catabolic rates correlated significantly (for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, r = 0.684, p less than 0.001; for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, r = 0.595, p less than 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean percent stenosis showed a significant relation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level (r = 0.678, p less than 0.01) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (r = 0.535, p less than 0.02) but not with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean percent stenosis also showed correlation with both fractional catabolic rate of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (r = 0.667, p less than 0.002) and with serum <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels (r = 0.504, p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides insights into the role of altered low and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The statistically significant association of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolic rates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, rather than their respective serum concentrations, implies that metabolic parameters may be more important in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
