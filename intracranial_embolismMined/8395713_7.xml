<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LMWHs may be an alternative regimen if contraindications for oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the effect of LMWH on the incidence of embolism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has been studied in 75 consecutive patients in comparison to no specific treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received one daily injection of the LMWH CY 216 (n = 35) subcutaneously over a period of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients of the control group (n = 40) were observed over the same period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group treated with CY 216, three embolic events (8.6%) occurred, of which two were localized in the cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these two cerebral embolic events was fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group, eight embolic events (20%) occurred, six of these were intracerebral and, of these, five were fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An even more pronounced difference between the groups was observed on evaluation of the patients with preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 15 patients treated with LMWH, one extracerebral nonfatal embolism occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the control group three of the seven patients (43%) experienced fatal reembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results show that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> one daily subcutaneous injection of LMWH reduces the incidence of arterial embolism to about one third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects were observed during the 6-month treatment period with LMWH </plain></SENT>
