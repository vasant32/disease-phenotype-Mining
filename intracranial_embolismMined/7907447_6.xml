<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study proposes methodology for estimating cerebral air <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> volume using transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler audio signals of air bubbles in the middle cerebral artery obtained from in vivo experiments were subjected to a fast-Fourier transform analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Audio segments when no air was present as well as artifact resulting from electrocautery and sensor movement were also subjected to fast-Fourier transform analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spectra were compared, and frequency and power differences were noted and used for development of audio band-pass filters for isolation of frequencies associated with air emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a bench model of the middle cerebral artery circulation, repetitive injections of various air volumes between 0.5 and 500 microL were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler audio output was band-pass filtered, acquired digitally, then subjected to a fast-Fourier transform power spectrum analysis and power spectrum integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A linear least-squares correlation was performed on the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fast-Fourier transform analysis of audio segments indicated that frequencies between 250 and 500 Hz are consistently dominant in the spectrum when air emboli are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Background frequencies appear to be below 240 Hz, and artifact resulting from sensor movement and electrocautery appears to be below 300 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data from the middle cerebral artery model filtered through a 307- to 450-Hz band-pass filter yielded a linear relation between emboli volume and the integrated value of the power spectrum near 40 microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Detection of emboli less than 0.5 microL was inconsistent, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> volumes greater than 40 microL were indistinguishable from one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary technique described in this study may represent a starting point from which automated detection and volume estimation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> might be approached </plain></SENT>
