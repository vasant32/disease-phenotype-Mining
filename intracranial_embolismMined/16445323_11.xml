<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the pressure gradient and degree of flow reduction associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection filters for carotid stenting in an in vitro experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three filter devices with a perforated membrane design and one wire mesh type filter were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At a pressure of 70 mmHg, the flow reduction and pressure gradient were measured in a 5-mm tube using blood-mimicking fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pressure gradient in the wire mesh filter was 1.65+/-0.49 mmHg (95% CI 1.32 to 1.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean pressure gradient in the perforated membrane filters was 6.88+/-2.62 mmHg (95% CI 6.22 to 7.55, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant correlation between pressure gradient and flow reduction (r=-0.77, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Embolic protection filters cause a pressure gradient and obstruct blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect is marked in perforated membrane filters and almost absent in the wire mesh filter </plain></SENT>
