<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 107 consecutive patients in whom a diagnostic cerebral angiography had been performed were prospectively investigated with DWI; 51 angiographies were performed by experienced neuroradiologists, 56 by neuroradiologists in training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 12 patients (11.1%), a total of 17 new lesions without any clinically overt neurological symptoms were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 12 patients, 11 (91.7%) with 16 lesions were investigated by junior neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 11 of 12 patients with DWI abnormalities (91.7%), risk factors could be identified (atherosclerotic vessel wall disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experienced neuroradiologists performed 21 of 48 angiographies (43.8%) on patients with the above-mentioned risk factors, whereas junior neuroradiologists performed 27 angiographies in this subgroup (46.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of diffusion abnormalities in patients with risk factors was 11/48 (22.9%) - considerably higher than in patients without risk factors (1/59; 1.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The level of experience and the nature of the underlying disease are predictors of the occurrence of cerebral ischemic events following neuroangiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternative diagnostic modalities should be employed in patients who are investigated for diseases with the highest risk of angiographic complications (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and arteriosclerotic vessel wall disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If diagnostic angiography remains necessary in these patients, the highest level of practitioner training is necessary to ensure good patient outcome </plain></SENT>
