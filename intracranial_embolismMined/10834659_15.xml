<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: We describe the case of a patient in whom a snare designed for the removal of foreign bodies was successfully used to retrieve a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> from the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique can be used to reestablish blood flow when maximal pharmacological therapies have failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old man with scrotal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> presented with the abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and numbness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography of the head showed no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or hypodensity, and right middle cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Cerebral angiography demonstrated a near-total occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery at the M1-M2 junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The administration of intra-arterial urokinase, systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and systemic abciximab, and mechanical maceration failed to lyse the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 4-mm goose-neck snare was guided through a microcatheter, and the clot was snared and withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immediate postoperative angiography demonstrated the reconstitution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination of the snared material was consistent with clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By postoperative Day 5, the patient had regained full strength, except for the fingers of the left hand, which remained moderately weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography demonstrated a right insular and extreme capsular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of a snare to remove clot in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As the use of intra-arterial thrombolysis increases, transcatheter snare removal of pharmacologically resistant clot may be considered as a salvage strategy </plain></SENT>
