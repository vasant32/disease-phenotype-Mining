<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brains were sectioned and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazoline <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> 6 h post-embolization to visualize infarcted areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a narrow dosage range for the effect of embolism measured by maximum decline in pH at 20 min, mortality, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This narrow range effect may be due to occlusion of collateral channels by the 16 micron microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between decline in pH at 20 min post-embolization and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (r2 = 0.76); this decline was the best early marker for eventual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This animal model for macroscopically heterogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> may be useful for the evaluation of therapeutic interventions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and as an aid in the interpretation of <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> spectra from mixed volumes of ischemic and non-ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
