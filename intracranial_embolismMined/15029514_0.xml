<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is present in 24% of the population over 60 and it increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by 2,4% 3%/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic treatment is considered as the treatment of choice for cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in this patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As far as we know there are not relevant data about the influence of these treatments on the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that may develop in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: Analyze whether there are differences in the clinical profile and functional prognosis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> depending on the type of treatment they were on at the time of occurrence of the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 67 patients who were admitted consecutively to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> over a period of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified according to the type of antithrombotic treatment they were on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional prognosis was estimated by Rankin score at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treated patient showed a non significant tendency to suffer less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and present a better functional situation at discharge than those who were not on prophylactic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treated patients had a significant higher prevalence of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (44,2% vs 9,1%; p= 0,0042) and HBP (81,4% vs 52%; p= 0,041) than non treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were more frequent in non treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Antithrombotic treatment not only prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> but may also contribute to the development of less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with a better functional prognosis in patients with AF and does not contribute to increase complications in these group of patients </plain></SENT>
