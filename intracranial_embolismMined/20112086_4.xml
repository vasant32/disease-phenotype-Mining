<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our subjects were 404 nontraumatically deceased patients who had been in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival at our emergency room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PMCT was performed within 2 h of the confirmation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed on 387 of the 404 subjects; and of these, cerebral GE was detected in 29 (7.5%) subjects (3 arterial, 25 venous, 1 undeterminable) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral GE was not noted in the other 17 of the 404 subjects who did not undergo CPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of cerebral GE between the subjects who underwent CPR and those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of cerebral arterial GE was presumed due to pulmonary barotrauma and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e>, while the thoracic pump theory was suggested to explain the cerebral venous GE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral arterial/venous GE is found in CPR cases on nontraumatic PMCT </plain></SENT>
