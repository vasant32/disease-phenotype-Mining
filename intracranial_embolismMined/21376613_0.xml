<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a caseous calcification of the mitral annulus, responsible for two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, in a 72-year-old female patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brain computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of a calcific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The echocardiography showed a liquidy, pseudotumoral mass combined with numerous calcifications located in the posterior part of the mitral annulus and extending toward the inferior surface of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During surgery, we found a direct communication between the caseous <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and the lumen of the left ventricle at the level of its inferior wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a valve repair procedure and excision of the caseous <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, combined with injection of bioglue into the cavity, to avoid recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six months after the procedure, the patient was in good health, and had no recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a satisfactory echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first description of spontaneous fistulization of a caseous <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the lumen of the left ventricle, explaining a new mechanism for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during the course of calcifying diseases of the mitral annulus </plain></SENT>
