<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 40 patients (mean age 64.3 +/-11.4) with ICA stenosis or occlusion, diagnosed with colour Doppler duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring of the middle cerebral artery downstream to ICA pathology was performed for 45 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> carotid territory symptoms were present in 26 (65%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient within this group had neuroimaging performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet drugs were administered in 35 patients (87.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 11 patients (27.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied patients was 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were present only in patients with ICA stenosis Å‚ 40% and in the symptomatic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (18.2%) with ICA occlusion showed <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was relationship between risk of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and age (OR = 2.7/10 years, 95% CI 1.1-6.7, p = 0.02), sex (more frequent in male: OR = 16.9, 95% CI 1.1-259; p = 0.04) and ischaemic lesions in computed tomography (OR = 9.8, 95% CI 1.0-99.1, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet treatment did not influence the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the study group (OR = 1.6; 95% CI 0.1-17.4; p = 0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in above 1/4 of patients and an associated with the degree of ICA stenosis and the presence of ischaemic lesions found in CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This may suggest a correlation between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
