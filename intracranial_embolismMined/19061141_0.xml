<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed a novel endovascular catheter system for rapid and reliable mechanical recanalization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> with little or no requirement for fibrinolytic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the evaluation of this device in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: Pulsed liquid jets were generated and ejected from the catheter exit by accelerating cold physiological saline (4 degrees C, 40 mL/h) using the energy of a pulsed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49648">holmium</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="28984">aluminum</z:chebi>-garnet (YAG) laser (3 Hz, 1.2 W) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accessibility beyond the tortuous cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery to the M1 and A1 regions was confirmed using a transparent model of the human cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanical characteristics of the liquid jets were evaluated with a high-speed camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liquid jets of physiological saline or urokinase solution (1,200 IU/mL) were exposed to artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> made of human blood under temperature monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remnants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were collected and incubated at 37 degrees C for 10 min for estimation of fibrinolysis rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The jet velocity (maximum: 5 m/s) was controlled by changing the laser energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fibrinolysis rates (mean+/-SD) after exposure to jets of saline or urokinase solution for 45 s were 62.2+/-16.4 and 94.0+/-3.4%, respectively, and were significantly better than the rate of 8.1+/-2.0% with administration of urokinase alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The local temperature rise was less than 8 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the laser-induced liquid jet catheter system may be a powerful tool for mechanical destruction of emboli and augmentation of the effect of fibrinolytic agents beyond the tortuous part of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
