<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms producing both focal and global neurologic injuries include embolization, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this present study, we report an association between variations in the treatment of the internal mammary artery with the detection of cerebral embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An intensive intraoperative neurologic and physiologic monitoring approach was implemented to associate discrete processes of clinical care with the concurrent detection of cerebral embolic signals, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method of treating the left internal mammary artery was tracked among 68 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral embolic signals were counted within 3 minutes of the treatment of the left internal mammary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among a series of 68 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, 22 were not treated with papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those treated, 12 received injection intraluminally and 28 had a topical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals were noted concurrently among 7 patients receiving injection of papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No embolic signals were noted among patients who were treated topically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report an association between the injection of papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> and cerebral embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that adoption of topical applications of papaverine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> may offer opportunities to reduce a portion of cerebral embolic signals in the setting of coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
