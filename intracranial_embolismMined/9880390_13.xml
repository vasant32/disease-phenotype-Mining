<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The present study investigated the influence of the antiplatelet agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) on cerebral microembolism as detected by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of arterial origin were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight had not received an antiplatelet or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> medication before TCD, and in 1 patient a preexisting <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> medication (100 mg/d) had not been changed since the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An initial 1-hour TCD monitoring was extended for an additional 2.5 hours after an intravenous bolus injection of 500 mg <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and was repeated for 1 hour on the following day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients only on the symptomatic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> bolus injection, a significant drop of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> rate was found in 7 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> without previous medication, starting 30 minutes after the application (mean per hour=25.1 [range, 6 to 66] versus mean per hour=6.4 [range, 0 to 14]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 of these patients, platelet aggregation tests were performed that demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aggregation before bolus injection and inhibited aggregability as early as 30 minutes after bolus injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> remained unchanged in 1 patient without antiplatelet medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ninth patient, who had suffered an ischemic event on <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, showed only a transient decrease of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of arterial origin, intravenous <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> can rapidly reduce cerebral microemboli as detected by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microemboli might be a useful parameter to monitor early effects of antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
