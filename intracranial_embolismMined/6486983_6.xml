<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is considerable debate regarding immediate anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> for patients suspected of having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> from a cardiac source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 60 consecutive hospitalized patients suspected of having a nonseptic cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> who, with one exception, were treated with immediate full-dose anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had progression of their neurologic deficits secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> or recurrent embolism, and there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> secondary to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had punctate <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> in the area of infarction, but remained clinically stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In light of our experience and a review of the literature, we conclude that immediate anticoagulation is judiciously safe in selected patients after nonseptic embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of cardiac origin, provided early cranial computed tomography fails to demonstrate hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
