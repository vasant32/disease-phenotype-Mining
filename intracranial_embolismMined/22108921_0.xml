<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether a clampless facilitating device (CFD) to perform proximal aortocoronary anastomoses would result in a lower incidence of cerebral embolic events compared with a partial clamping strategy during off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After epiaortic ultrasound confirmed the mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> (Grades I and II), 57 patients were randomly assigned to have proximal anastomoses using a partial-occluding clamp (CL, n = 28) or a CFD [Heartstring (HS), n = 29] (Maquet Cardiovascular LLC, San Jose, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Solid and gaseous emboli in the middle cerebral arteries were detected using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean number of proximal anastomoses was similar between groups 1.93 ± 0.72 (CL) and 1.72 ± 0.70 (HS) (P = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean number of gaseous plus solid emboli was greater in the CL group than the HS group (90.0 ± 64.0 vs. 50.8 ± 36.6, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emboli were fewest in patients undergoing HS anastomoses using the suction device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> was proportional to the number of proximal anastomoses in the HS groups, but independent of the number of proximal anastomoses in the CL groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a low burden of aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, partial clamping of the ascending aorta during OPCAB was associated with more cerebral embolic events compared with an anastomosis with a CFD </plain></SENT>
