<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An association between deficiency of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has not been clearly demonstrated in humans, but previous studies have focused on the measurement of plasma TFPI, which is only a small part of the total body TFPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major fraction of this natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> can be measured in plasma after release by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate if deficiency of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-releasable TFPI is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>. we measured TFPI activity in plasma before and 10 min after intravenous injection of 7500 IU unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in 64 young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, 49 young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and 38 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> TFPI activity levels were significantly lower in the group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> than in controls (mean+/-SD: 230%+/-39 vs 260%+/-34, p = 0.0002), whereas there was no difference for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Defining the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range as the mean+/-2 SD of TFPI activity in controls, twelve patients had low post-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> TFPI activity levels, seven with venous and five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low levels of TFPI activity were confirmed by immunoassay in six of the seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and two of the five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, and were present also in at least one first degree relative of six patients, suggesting that the defect might be inheritable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the causative role of low <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-releasable TFPI remains uncertain, because co-segregation of the defect with thrombotic symptoms could not be demonstrated in the small number of families studied </plain></SENT>
