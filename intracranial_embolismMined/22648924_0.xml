<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (T-AVI) is an accepted alternative treatment option for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> seen inoperable or high risk for aortic valve (AV) replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a significant risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and cerebrovascular complications raises concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral embolizations during T-AVI are frequent and recent data demonstrates that balloon aortic valvuloplasty during transcatheter procedures causes nearly as many high-intensity transient signals and microembolic signals as the deployment of the transcatheter heart valve itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Omitting predilatation, therefore, may reduce the incidence of microembolizations and a possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have developed a novel technique of 'Direct Transapical Aortic Valve Implantation', which enables surgeons to avoid predilatation of the native AV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>So far, a total of six consecutive patients were treated using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> SAPIEN XTâ„¢ transcatheter heart valve (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with conventional transapical implantations using the same device, procedure time was shorter, less contrast used and duration of fluoroscopy reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedural success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were discharged home without greater than or equal to moderate paravalvular leakage observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Direct transapical implantation is technically safe and effective, with shorter radiation/procedure times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is the next logical step in the direction of a full percutaneous transapical approach and potentially can result in reduced microembolizations </plain></SENT>
