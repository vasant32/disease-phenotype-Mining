<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors determined the platelet aggregation(PA) activity respectively with electric impedance and photoelectric turbidimetry in patients with ischemic cardio-cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> associated with blood stasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed the PA activities were elevated both in whole blood and plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, the authors detected simultaneously the PA activity and amount of post-aggregation beta-thromboglobulin(beta-TG) releasing and also in vivo amount of spontaneous plasma releasing of beta-TG with photoelectric turbidimetry and RIA methods with blood stasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed, during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a high activated state of platelet existed, expressed as significant elevation both of the amount of beta-TG releasing of post-aggregation and plasma beta-TG level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no definite correlation between rate of PA and subsequent amount of beta-TG releasing was found, and detection of aggregation rate alone did not disclose the state of activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As compared with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, during the recovery stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in which the clinical symptom of blood stasis was improved, the plasma beta-TG level declined significantly, however, was still higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls; amount of releasing beta-TG was declining which denoted that the platelet functions were reducing then, but were still in a higher state of activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that there were changes both in number and quality of platelet in patients with blood stasis </plain></SENT>
