<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we used a previously established quantitative rat model of tPA-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> to test the hypothesis that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to embolic focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by placing homologous blood clots into the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups of rats were studied: (1) untreated controls that received saline at 6 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; (2) rats that received tPA alone (10 mg/kg at 6 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>); and (3) rats that received tPA plus the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor BB-94 (50 mg/kg of BB-94 before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and at 3 and 6 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> plus tPA at 6 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gelatin zymography was used to quantify MMP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> spectrophotometry method was used to quantify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesions were measured at 24 hours with tetrazolium staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6, 12, and 24 hours, pro-MMP-9 and cleaved MMP-9 were upregulated in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 12 hours, tPA-treated rats showed significantly higher levels of pro-MMP-9 and cleaved MMP-9 than untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By 24 hours, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats showed evidence of hemorrhagic transformation in the ischemic territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rats treated with BB-94 and tPA showed significantly reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volumes compared with those that received tPA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that (1) tPA treatment increases levels of MMP-9 after embolic focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, (2) MMPs are involved in the mechanism of tPA-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and (3) combination therapies with MMP inhibitors may be useful for decreasing the risk and severity of this dreaded complication of thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
