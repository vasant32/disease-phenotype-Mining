<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Strategy for severe aortic atheromatous disease identified by intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used axillary artery inflow through graft interposition in an attempt to avoid potential embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July 1995 and June 1997, axillary artery inflow was used in 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Procedures performed were coronary artery bypass in 21 patients (3 with combined carotid endarterectomy), aortic valve replacement in 2, valve replacement plus coronary artery bypass in 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> repair in 1, and arch replacement in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrillatory arrest was used in 16 patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was used in 16 patients for excision of mobile atheroma or arch reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antegrade cerebral perfusion through the axillary artery graft was carried out in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no brachial neurovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 2 more had postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with resolution at late follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the subset of patients who had antegrade cerebral perfusion during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The axillary artery is an excellent site for arterial inflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, antegrade cerebral perfusion is easily accomplished during periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, graft placement avoids potential local neurovascular complications </plain></SENT>
