<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduced LAA contraction velocities, determined by the transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), are associated with increased risk of LAA spontaneous echocontrast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, and a history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, TEE remains a semi-invasive procedure, limiting its serial application as a screening tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is desirable to obtain information regarding LAA function by transthoracic echocardiography in patients having cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate various echocardiographic variables for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to predict LAA dysfunction, reflected as reduced LAA contraction velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied a total of 61 patients with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (42 patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (19 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomographic scanning was performed for the diagnosis of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left atrial functional parameters determined by transthoracic echocardiography, such as left atrial active emptying fraction and acceleration slope of mitral inflow A wave, had significant correlations with the LAA contraction velocity (r = 0.57, p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.54, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left atrial volume index, left atrial active emptying volume and left atrial fractional shortening were also correlated with LAA contraction velocity (r = -0.44, p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.38, p = 0.003; r = 0.37, p = 0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, transthoracic echocardiography can provide valuable and reliable information about the LAA contraction velocity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding gives new insights for the appropriate strategy in the evaluation of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
