<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a high incidence of neuropsychological defects after cardiac surgery, which may be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> during the rewarming period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">phosphorus-31</z:chebi> magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi> MRS) was used to identify changes in cerebral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectra in patients before and immediately after hypothermic CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Localised cerebral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi> MRS (TR 5000 ms) was performed at 1.5 Tesla on each patient the day before and within an hour of completion of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peak areas for phosphomonoesters (PME), inorganic phosphate (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>), phosphodiesters (PDE), phosphocreatine (PCr) and beta ATP (betaATP) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Metabolite peak area ratios and relative percentages of each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> resonance with respect to the total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the post-operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectra, each patient displayed a marked reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>/betaATP and increase in PCr/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spectral changes in percentage metabolite signals following surgery varied both in magnitude and pattern between patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two patients there was an increased postoperative percentage PME and percentage PCr with a decrease in percentage betaATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The converse was found in the other two patients, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four subjects displayed a markedly decreased percentage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> after CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These metabolite changes probably reflect rebound phosphorylation in the immediate postoperative period and suggest increased metabolic activity in the hyperaemic brain on rewarming from hypothermic CPB </plain></SENT>
