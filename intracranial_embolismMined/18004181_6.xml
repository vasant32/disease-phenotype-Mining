<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although variables such as advanced age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain emboli</z:e> have been recognized as risk factors for mortality, cooperative multi-institutional studies have not assessed the role of other variables, such as nosocomial acquisition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, the presence of comorbidities, or the changing antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci, as factors determining prognosis.We conducted the current study to determine the risk factors for mortality in patients with enterococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 47 consecutive episodes of enterococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in 44 patients diagnosed according to the modified Duke criteria from a retrospective cohort study of cases of infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was inhospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We applied stepwise logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors for mortality.Predisposing heart conditions were observed in 86.3% of patients, and 17 had prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A portal of entry was suspected or determined in 38.2%; the genitourinary tract was the most common source of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (29.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comorbidities were present in 52.2% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve episodes (25.5%) were acquired during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 3 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were highly resistant to gentamicin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (40.9%) needed valve replacement due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> or relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparing cases of native valve and prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, we found no differences regarding complications, the need for surgical treatment, or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight of 44 (18%) episodes were fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age over 70 years (p = 0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-2.25; p = 0.001), presence of 1 or more comorbidities (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.11-9.39; p = 0.02), and nosocomial acquisition (OR, 8.05; 95% CI, 1.50-43.2; p = 0.01) were associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, only nosocomial acquisition increased the risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients with enterococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, nosocomial acquisition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is an important factor determining outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> and the population of elderly people at risk continue to grow, the hazard of acquiring nosocomial enterococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> may increase; hence, major emphasis must be put on prevention </plain></SENT>
