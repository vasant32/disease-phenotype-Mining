<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients used the arm ipsilateral to damage, and the control groups used the same arm as their respective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesion size and location were similar for the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No deficits were found for the right hemisphere <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group's tapping speed was not slower at the smallest target, but became progressively slower relative to the control group's as target size increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variability in tapping speed increased as target size increased for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except the left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the entire left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group was as accurate as their controls, the apraxic, but not nonapraxic, patients made more errors on smaller targets only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two explanations for these findings both emphasize the left hemisphere's special role in motor programming; one focuses upon its dominance for movements which are independent of sensory feedback and the other emphasizes its specialization for processing rapid temporal information </plain></SENT>
