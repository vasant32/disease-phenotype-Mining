<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first three waves of the evoked response originating from the acoustic nerve and auditory nuclei in the caudal pons were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in wave form, peak latency, and voltage level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Waves IV and V, generated in the region of the lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus in rostral pons and caudal midbrain, demonstrated prolonged peak latency and reduced voltage, indicative of slowed neural conduction in the pons above the level of the superior olivary complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that auditory evoked potential recordings may have considerable value in the localization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
