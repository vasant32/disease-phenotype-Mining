<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has however been reported that IA injection of stem cells carries the risk of reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and microstrokes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we evaluate the safety of IA neural progenitor cell (NPC) delivery to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow of rats was monitored during IA injection of single cell suspensions of NPCs after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals received 1 × 10(6) NPCs either injected via a microneedle (microneedle group) into the patent common carotid artery (CCA) or via a catheter into the proximally ligated CCA (catheter group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Controls included saline-only injections and cell injections into non-stroked sham animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow in the microneedle group remained at baseline, whereas in the catheter group a persistent (15 minutes) decrease to 78% of baseline occurred (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In non-stroked controls, NPCs injected via the catheter method resulted in higher levels of Iba-1-positive inflammatory cells (P=0.003), higher numbers of degenerating neurons as seen in Fluoro-Jade C staining (P&lt;0.0001) and ischemic changes on diffusion weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With an appropriate technique, reduction in CBF and microstrokes do not occur with IA transplantation of NPCs </plain></SENT>
