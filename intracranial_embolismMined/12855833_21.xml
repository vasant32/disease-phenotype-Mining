<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been proposed that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> and spin-trap agents may be neuroprotective after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> ebselen is currently in clinical trials, little is known about the effectiveness of ebselen, which has <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase-like and anti-inflammatory properties in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we determined the effects of ebselen when administered alone or with the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacological agent for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male New Zealand White rabbits were embolized by injection of a suspension of small blood clots into the middle cerebral artery via a catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five minutes after embolization, ebselen (10 to 50 mg/kg) was infused intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control rabbits received infusions of the vehicle required to solubilize ebselen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In additional rabbits, ebselen (20 mg/kg) was administered 60 minutes after embolization, either alone or in combination with tPA (0.9 or 3.3 mg/kg tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Behavioral analysis was conducted 24 hours after embolization, allowing determination of the effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> dose (P50) or clot amount (mg) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A drug is considered neuroprotective if it significantly increases the P50 compared with the vehicle-treated control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The P50 of controls 24 hours after embolization was 1.35+/-0.30 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rabbits treated 5 minutes after embolization with 10, 20, or 50 mg/kg ebselen had P50 values of 2.12+/-0.56, 2.82+/-0.75 (P&lt;0.05), and 0.49+/-0.54 mg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant neuroprotective effect was observed with the 20-mg/kg dose, but not if there was a 60-minute delay before administration (P50=1.69+/-0.32 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When tPA (3.3 mg/kg) was infused 60 minutes after embolization and ebselen (20 mg/kg) was injected at either 5 (P50=2.98+/-0.18 mg) or 60 (P50=3.60+/-0.79 mg) minutes, there was no additional neuroprotective effect compared with tPA alone (P50=3.38+/-0.55 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, if ebselen (20 mg/kg) was administered concomitantly with low-dose tPA (0.9 mg/kg) 60 minutes after embolization, the P50 was 3.52+/-0.73 mg (P&lt;0.05), indicating a synergistic effect of the drug combination because neither alone was effective (P50=1.69+/-0.32 and 1.54+/-0.36 mg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that ebselen may be neuroprotective when administered shortly after an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the time- and dose-response analyses suggest that it has a narrow therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, ebselen may be beneficial if administered concomitantly with a thrombolytic because it significantly enhanced the neuroprotective activity of low-dose tPA </plain></SENT>
