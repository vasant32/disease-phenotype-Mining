<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical course can vary considerably, with regard to both the symptoms and the interval between injury and manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and intimal tear are usually observed after blunt internal carotid artery injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic plaque is often observed in the cervical internal carotid artery and carotid bifurcation, but involvement of plaque has been confirmed in relatively few cases of blunt traumatic internal carotid injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a 58-year-old man who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> due to intraplaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> after a minor whiplash injury and was successfully treated with carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred within the atherosclerotic plaque, we named the mechanism of this case "plaque injury" </plain></SENT>
