<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data of microembolic signals and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were assessed blindly and independently by separate observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed that 15 patients (50%) had single <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 15 patients had multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals were detected in 10 patients (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median number of microembolic signals per 30 minutes was 15 (range, 3-102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals were found in 9 patients with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and in 1 patient with a single <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (p = 0.002, chi(2)) </plain></SENT>
