<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of a young man with delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> after mild head injury, suggestive of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> (CFE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To underline the value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in the differential diagnosis of secondary deterioration in mild head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old man admitted with mild head injury after a fall with facial fractures and long bone fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to the intensive care unit and was mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Weaning was not possible because of desaturations and <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Low platelet count</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On several time points during his admission cerebral imaging data were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-contrast CT on admission was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> while follow-up MRI showed extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These imaging abnormalities combined with the clinical presentation suggests cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> (CFE) as the most likely cause of secondary deterioration in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In head injured patients with long bone fractures one should consider cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the classical clinical syndrome is not present, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is warranted for diagnosis and to exclude other causes of secondary deterioration </plain></SENT>
