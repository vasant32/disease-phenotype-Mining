<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presumably the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> originated from rupture of the unsuspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100730'>bronchogenic cyst</z:hpo> as a result of pressure changes during the ascent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> has been observed during surgery, in scuba diving accidents, submarine escapes and less frequently during exposure to very high altitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>People with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100730'>bronchogenic cysts</z:hpo> should be informed about the risk of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> and surgical removal should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is a rare cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> activities with rapid air pressure changes, including alpine tourism, as our unfortunate tourist illustrates </plain></SENT>
