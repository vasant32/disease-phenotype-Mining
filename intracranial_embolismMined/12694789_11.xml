<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When severe neurological complications follow cardiac surgery, diffuse cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> are present at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recycling shed blood with cardiotomy suction is an important source of cerebral fat microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cell saver may reduce this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients were prospectively randomised to assess the amount of fat in blood salvaged from the pericardium and returned to the patient with either cell saver or cardiotomy suction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken before and after filtration in the cardiotomy suction group or cell saver processing in the cell saver group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After centrifuging samples, fat content was graded on a scale of 0-3 by a blinded independent observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fat content was also quantified by weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with cardiotomy suction, cell saver removed significantly more fat from shed blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median fat grading after cell saver was 0 (0-1) compared with 1 (1-2) for cardiotomy suction (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Percentage reduction in fat weight achieved by cell saver or cardiotomy suction was 87% compared to 45% (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the post-operative use of blood or blood products, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of cell saver results in less fat being recycled during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
