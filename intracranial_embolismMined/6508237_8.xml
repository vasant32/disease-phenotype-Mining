<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>True three-dimensional volumetric data were obtained for subsequent reconstruction of images at various orientations, including transverse, coronal, and sagittal, and for specific matching to x-ray computed tomographic planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A variety of radiofrequency pulse sequences was used to generate images weighted by the NMR parameters spin density (p) and spin-lattice (T1) and spin-spin (T2) relaxation times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative T1 data and qualitative T2 information were obtained from appropriate sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proton NMR images embodying T1 information provided adequate delineation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial anatomical structure and a high level of gray matter-white matter contrast; high lesion detection sensitivity in various clinical forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was seen in images providing both T1 and T2 information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T1 and T2 relaxation times were prolonged in embolic, thrombotic, and watershed infarctions as well as in lacunae; shortening of T1 and T2 was found in <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serpiginous vessels in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> were seen that had particular pulse sequences </plain></SENT>
