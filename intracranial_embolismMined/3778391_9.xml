<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A review of case records spanning 20 years revealed 140 cases of decompression pulmonary barotrauma (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi>) in divers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 23 cases of uncomplicated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> and 117 cases of cerebral arterial gas embolism (AGE), of which 58 had respiratory manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Details of presentation and precipitating factors were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half of AGE cases improved spontaneously, including 21% which recovered completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 89 treated cases of AGE (including 2 iatrogenic cases) were used to study the efficacy of different treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An overall success rate of 65% was seen with 62% of cures occurring within 25 min of arrival at pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining cures occurred in equal numbers during decompression and after surfacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cases receiving steroids relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increasing the time to treatment reduced the likelihood of cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison of treatments proved difficult and it was concluded that, although most cases would probably respond satisfactorily to 2.8 bar (2100 mm Hg) of oxygen, there were no compelling reasons for altering the current treatment practice of beginning treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cases with a 30-min period at 6.0 bar (165 fsw) before returning to 2.8 bar (60 fsw) to complete the therapy </plain></SENT>
