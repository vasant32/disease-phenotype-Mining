<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well documented in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present pertinent information on three patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> involved the territory of the internal carotid artery and were associated with crack use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: These patients were investigated clinically, radiologically, intraoperatively, and/or histopathologically at the same institution, and the diagnostic evaluations did not reveal a definite cardiac or hematologic cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large filling defects were noted on conventional carotid angiography in two of these patients; in the third patient, the histopathological changes were compatible with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, these changes have not been previously documented in human arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that some brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> among crack cocaine users may result from vasospasm of large arteries and secondary intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
