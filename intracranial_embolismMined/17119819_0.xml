<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective review of patients with embolized <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) between January 1999 and August 2005 in our institution and analysis of two cases of occlusion in residual <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> that received endovascular treatment and had post-embolization residual nidus malformation, which in later angiographic controls showed a complete disappearance of the lesions without other treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The spontaneous occlusion of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> is an infrequent occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several related mechanisms are discussed </plain></SENT>
