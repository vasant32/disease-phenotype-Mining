<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess if there was an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> and the amount of intracranial blood seen on computerized tomographic (CT) scanning following an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> bleed in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The charts of 70 patients who had had a preoperative CT scan and a preoperative ECG within 96 h of bleed were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological status of the patients was graded according to the Botterell classification and the amount of blood seen on the CT scan was graded by the Fisher classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients had an <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy percent of these abnormalities involved the T wave or the ST segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> was statistically greater for patients who had an increased amount of intracranial blood or an intracerebral clot, as seen on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had treatment (surgical n = 69, embolization n = 1) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither the amount of blood seen on CT scan nor the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> was useful in predicting patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, an increased quantity of intracranial blood was associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
