<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the early postoperative detection of microembolic ultrasonic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) may be of value in identifying patients at risk of postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> and that the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> rate may be an important determinant in risk prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients undergoing CEA were studied at intervals up to 24 h postoperatively with TCD insonation of the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to the operation side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study design was open and prospective with blinded off-line analysis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>End-points were any focal ischaemic neurological deficit and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> up to 30 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 69% of cases during the first hour postoperatively with counts ranging from 0 to 212 MES/h (means 19 MES/h; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> +2- 4.5; median 4 MES/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In seven cases (10.8%) counts were &gt; 50 MES/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of these seven cases developed ischaemic neurological deficits in the territory of the insonated middle cerebral artery during the monitoring period </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Frequent signals (&gt; 50 MES/h) occur in approximately 10% of cases in the early postoperative phase of CEA and are predictive for the development of ipsilateral focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
