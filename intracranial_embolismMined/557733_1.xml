<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1) After intravenous injection of 2 g of <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi>, ventricular CSF was obtained in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these 4 cases showed <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> concentration in CSF to be below 0.1 mcg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2) After intravenous injection of 2 g of <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi>, lumbar CSF was obtained in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two cases out of these 6 cases, <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> concentration in CSF was higher than 0.7 mcg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3) In 13 cases 2 g of <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> with 200ml of 20% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">Mannitol</z:chebi> was injected intravenously and lumbar CSF was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> concentrations in CSF between 0.7 mcg/ml and 6.0 mcg/ml were observed in 9 cases of this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4) According to the results it is strongly suggested that the administration of Monnitol and <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> is very effective for penetration of <z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi> into CSF </plain></SENT>
