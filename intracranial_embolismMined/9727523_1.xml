<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate through the use of cerebral Doppler technology whether emboli are a more common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007634'>nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy</z:hpo> (NAION) than previously recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients with a recent (&lt;121 days) history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007634'>nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy</z:hpo> and 10 age-matched controls (event &gt; 121 days) were examined using a Nicolet Pioneer 2020 transcranial Doppler (TCD) unit with a 2-MHz bilateral continuous monitoring capability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The right and left middle cerebral arteries were evaluated simultaneously for 30 minutes at a depth of 50 to 55 mm, and the number of emboli, blood flow velocities, and pulsatility indices were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were stored by computer, and hard-copy color recordings were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of 11 patients with a recent history of NAION demonstrated microemboli by TCD examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient in the control group who had a remote history of NAION had a microembolic event rate of 12 per hour (six over 30 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This patient had a history of prosthetic cardiac valve replacement and was taking anticoagulation medication at the time of the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not reveal an increased incidence of embolic events in patients with NAION when they were examined in a transcranial Doppler study of the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study does not support embolism as a frequent cause of NAION </plain></SENT>
