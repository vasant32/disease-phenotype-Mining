<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A review of other authors' experience with this procedure shows no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> directly attributable to thrombectomy, although two patients had cerebral embolization during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For prevention of this complication, we propose that both the aorta and the left atrium be explored during thrombectomy of either the mitral or the aortic prosthesis so as to achieve complete exposure of the left ventricular outflow tract and complete removal of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> located in the ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We consider this the procedure of tract and complete removal of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> located in the ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We consider this the procedure of choice in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the Björk-Shiley prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Replacement of the prosthesis would then be restricted to cases of prosthesis damage or those in which adequate anticoagulation cannot be maintained </plain></SENT>
