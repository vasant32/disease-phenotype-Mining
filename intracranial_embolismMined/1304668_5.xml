<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the efficacy of an initial compression to 6 atm abs on a 53% nitrogen:47% oxygen mixture (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> = 2.8 atm abs) before breathing oxygen at 2.8 and 1.9 atm abs for the treatment of feline cerebral arterial gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurophysiologic function was determined by measuring the cortical somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) amplitude in anesthetized ventilated cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Air was infused into the carotid artery until the SEP amplitude was reduced to less than 10% of baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were randomly separated into 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first group (CONTROL) (n = 7) served as control and remained at the surface, breathing air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second group (NITROX) (n = 10) was compressed to 6 atm abs breathing a 53:47% nitrox mixture for 30 min followed by breathing 100% oxygen at 2.8 and 1.9 atm abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third group (HBO) (n = 10) was compressed to 2.8 and 1.9 atm abs breathing 100% oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Air infusion suppressed the SEP amplitude to the same level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CONTROL group recovered 27.6 +/- 31.2% (mean +/- standard deviation) of the baseline SEP amplitude, whereas the NITROX group recovered 63.2 +/- 28.2%, and the HBO group recovered 66.0 +/- 19.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed that both treatment profiles promote significant (P = 0.03) recovery of the SEP amplitude compared to no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We find no additional benefit, however, by initiating treatment at 6 atm abs, even when additional oxygen is provided </plain></SENT>
