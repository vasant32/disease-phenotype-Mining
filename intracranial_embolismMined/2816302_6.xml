<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The early morphological consequences of recirculation following middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion were studied in two rat models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was occluded for 1 h by either a surgical clip or platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>; subsequently, 1 h of recirculation was facilitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following clip occlusion and recirculation, mild astrocytic swelling, especially around blood vessels, was detected in reperfused cortical and striatal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuronal changes included slight chromatin clumping and dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, severe structural abnormalities were detected following recanalization of the thrombosed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marked astrocytic swelling of cell bodies and perivascular processes with neuropil vacuolation were commonly seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern of neuronal alterations, including a high frequency of dense shrunken neurons surrounded by swollen astrocytic processes was documented in cortical and striatal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe neuronal changes were documented in brain regions exhibiting a well-perfused microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial cells contained large numbers of pinocytotic vesicles associated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> and abluminal surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pronounced and rapid morphological changes evolve with reperfusion when thrombotic and ischemic events occur simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The basis for these rapid parenchymal changes following vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may involve <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> alterations in cerebral microvascular permeability which exacerbate ischemic consequences </plain></SENT>
