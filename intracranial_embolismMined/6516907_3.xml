<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MVP demonstrated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three diagnostic modalities was classified as definite and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> in at least one but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three tests were designated as ambiguous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding the frequency of definite MVP, no statistically significant difference was demonstrated between patients with CIA (3%) and controls (0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ambiguous MVP was rather common in patients with cerebrovascular disease (13%) but equally frequent in control patients (20%) </plain></SENT>
