<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Current guidelines for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> prevention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or flutter (AFF) recommend <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">Vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (VKAs) for patients at high-intermediate risk and aspirin for those at intermediate-low risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness of these treatments was demonstrated also in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are several reports that emphasize the underuse of pharmacological prophylaxis of cardio-embolism in patients with AFF in different health care settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the adherence to current guidelines on cardio-embolic prophylaxis in elderly (&gt; 65 years old) patients admitted with an established diagnosis of AFF to the Italian internal medicine wards participating in REPOSI registry, a project on polypathologies/polytherapies stemming from the collaboration between the Italian Society of Internal Medicine and the Mario Negri Institute of Pharmacological Research; to investigate whether or not hospitalization had an impact on guidelines adherence; to test the role of possible modifiers of VKAs prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed registry data collected from January to December 2008 and assessed the prevalence of patients with AFF at admission and the prevalence of risk factors for cardio-embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After stratifying the patients according to their CHADS(2) score the percentage of appropriateness of antithrombotic therapy prescription was evaluated both at admission and at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were employed to verify whether or not socio-demographic (age &gt;80years, living alone) and clinical features (previous or recent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, cranio-facial trauma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) modified the frequency and modalities of antithrombotic drugs prescription at admission and discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 1332 REPOSI patients, 247 were admitted with AFF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At admission, CHADS(2) score was â‰¥ 2 in 68.4% of patients, at discharge in 75.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with AFF 26.5% at admission and 32.8% at discharge were not on any antithrombotic therapy, and 43.7% at admission and 40.9% at discharge were not taking an appropriate therapy according to the CHADS(2) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The higher the level of cardio-embolic risk the higher was the percentage of antiplatelet- but not of VKAs-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At admission or at discharge, both at univariable and at multivariable logistic regression, only an age &gt;80 years and a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, previous or active, had a statistically significant negative effect on VKAs prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, only a positive history of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events (past or present) was independently associated to no VKA prescription at discharge in patients who were on VKA therapy at admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was considered as an appropriate therapy for patients with indication for VKAs, the percentage of patients admitted or discharged on appropriate therapy became respectively 43.7% and 53.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among elderly patients admitted with a diagnosis of AFF to internal medicine wards, an appropriate antithrombotic prophylaxis was taken by less than 50%, with an underuse of VKAs prescription independently of the level of cardio-embolic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hospitalization did not improve the adherence to guidelines </plain></SENT>
