<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 65 consecutive patients with a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who had an appropriate CT-proven small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the territory of the lateral (61 patients), medial (3 patients) or both lateral and medial lenticulostriate arteries (1 patient) from the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While more than 75% of these patients were either hypertensive or diabetic (having at least one cause for small-artery disease), embolic sources were encountered in 35%, either from large vessels (28%), and/or from the heart (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other causes (<z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>) were found in only 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurologic deficit was purely motor in more than 50% of the patients (in half of them with neuropsychological dysfunctions), a sensori-motor deficit was present in 30% (in half of them with neuropsychological dysfunctions), and only 20% had ataxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No one had pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the classical lacunar syndrome or the modality of sensory, motor or ataxic deficits were specific for any topographic subdivision of LS territory, but there was a tendency for clinical features to be linked with the involved basal ganglia and the topography of pathways in the internal capsule as delineated by anatomical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pure motor deficits were associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the medial and posterior part of LS territory, visual field deficits and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e> always corresponded to posteriorly situated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological deficits were common in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the anterior and posterior subdivisions of LS territory, with a major effect of the size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sensory deficits</z:e> were not correlated with any location in LS territory, probably because thalamo-efferent fibres have a more diffuse course through the internal capsule </plain></SENT>
