<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains complicated by serious risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a novel model of tPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was used in spontaneously hypertensive rats to examine the correlates of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and test methods of reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Homologous blood clot emboli were used to occlude the middle cerebral artery in spontaneously hypertensive rats, and delayed administration of tPA (6 hours postischemia) resulted in high rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with untreated rats, tPA significantly increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volumes by almost 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, infarction and neurological deficits were worsened by tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A parallel experiment in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats showed markedly reduced rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and tPA did not significantly increase <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To examine whether tPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was caused by the delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion per se, another group of spontaneously hypertensive rats was subjected to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> using a mechanical method of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed (6 hours) reperfusion via mechanical means did not induce <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, administration of tPA plus delayed mechanical reperfusion significantly increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since reperfusion injury was implicated, a final experiment compared outcomes in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with tPA plus the free radical spin trap alpha-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert butyl</z:chebi> nitrone (alpha-PBN) versus tPA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>tPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volumes were reduced by 40% with alpha-PBN, and infarction and neurological deficits were also decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that (1) blood pressure is an important correlate of tPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, (2) tPA interacts negatively with reperfusion injury to promote <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and (3) combination therapies with anti-free radical treatments may reduce the severity of tPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and brain injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
