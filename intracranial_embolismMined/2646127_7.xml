<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) the blood flow velocities in the basal cerebral arteries (BCA) can be recorded at any age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient stenoses or occlusions of main cerebral arteries were detected in 11 children by this method and confirmed by other techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm produced a marked increase in flow velocities in the affected arteries which was reduced by nimodipine, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm also occurred in severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> due to cerebral arterial obstruction no flow velocities could be recorded at the corresponding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If distal branches were obstructed reduced flow velocities were found proximally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased flow velocities or reversed flow in anastomoses indicated the collateralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The transient nature of the occlusions was shown by repeated recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD is a reliable, noninvasive and rapidly available technique for diagnosing or excluding transient flow disturbances in the main cerebral arteries as the cause of neurological symptoms in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It indicates the necessity and most advantageous stage for therapy </plain></SENT>
