<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of those subjects free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the time of study entry, 2,916 were classified as nondrinkers of alcohol and 4,962 as drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 12 years of follow-up, 197 drinkers and 93 nondrinkers experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant relationships were noted between alcohol and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When compared with nondrinkers, however, the risk of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> more than doubled for light drinkers and nearly tripled for those considered to be heavy drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings are statistically significant and independent of hypertensive status and other risk factors </plain></SENT>
