<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with a significant (&gt;70%) (a)symptomatic stenosis has been proven thoroughly in major trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether, after cross-clamping the carotid artery, the time interval between determination that a shunt is needed and the actual functioning of the shunt, defined as the need for shunt-to-shunt time (NST), influences 30-day morbidity and mortality rate after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experienced vascular surgeons performed 851 CEAs with a selective shunting protocol based on perioperative transcranial Doppler measurement and electroencephalographic findings, and data were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 156 shunted patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Longer NST was associated with an increase in the 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A binary logistic regression model was used to determine a 2-tailed P value of .004 and an odds ratio of 1.5/min increase of the NST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no influence on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of gender, age, symptomatic or asymptomatic stenosis, the use of a patch or not, or the number of periprocedural microembolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: If CEA is performed with a selective shunting protocol, a longer NST increases the 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support a strong recommendation that shunt placement should be as quick as possible </plain></SENT>
