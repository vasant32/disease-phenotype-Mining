<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In six anesthetized horses, one internal carotid artery was catheterized 2 cm from its origin and blood pressure was recorded continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then the artery was ligated, pressure was recorded again, and the horses were euthanatized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In another three anesthetized horses, indwelling catheters were placed in both internal carotid arteries and a loose ligature was placed proximal to one catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After horses recovered from anesthesia, the ligature was tied and blood pressure was recorded in both arteries on that day and 3 days later, then these horses were euthanatized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the cerebral arteries was examined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine horses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure in the internal carotid arteries did not change after ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjectively, collateral channels considered most likely to maintain blood pressure in the ligated internal carotid artery were the caudal intercarotid artery and the cerebral arterial circle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that ligation of the internal carotid artery would not prevent severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from the internal carotid artery in horses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0276645" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">guttural pouch mycosis</z:e> until the ligated artery thrombosed to the level of the lesion </plain></SENT>
