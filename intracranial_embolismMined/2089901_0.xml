<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure was monitored by changes in epidural pressure (EDP), which was recorded by our designed flaccid microballoon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EDP changes could be divided into the two types: the first was moderate elevation, less than 20 mm Hg and the second was prominent, more than 20 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue pH on the embolized side showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> changes composed of acidotic and alkalotic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alkalotic change was frequently seen at the deep cerebrum which might be the result of plasma exudation due to disruption of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of the EDP elevation was positively correlated with the extension of alkalotic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Energy metabolism was also mainly disturbed in the deep cerebrum, but did not completely correspond to the pH change of the area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results would indicate that embolization of the main cerebral artery could induce severe ischaemic insult on the deep cerebrum with massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> due to an early disruption of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
