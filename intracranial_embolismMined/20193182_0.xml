<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2004, 106 consecutive patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF underwent catheter ablation and were followed-up for (60.7 + or - 11.8) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Segmental pulmonary vein isolation (SPVI) was routinely performed by radiofrequency energy under the guidance of circular mapping catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up with 24 h-holter, ECG, telephone or letter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on recurrence of AF, the anticoagulation medication and the incidence of embolism, anti-arrhythmic therapy were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 9 patients lost to follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 97 patients [65 males, (54.8 + or - 11.2) years old], 3 cases died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, sinus rhythm was maintained in 68 patients (Group S, 72.3%) and AF recurrence evidenced in 26 patients (Group R, 27.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group S, 56 patients (82.4%) discontinued anticoagulation medication, and 12 patients continued to take aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no embolism event in Group S during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Group R, 1 patient continued to take <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>; 11 patients continued to take aspirin and 2 patients suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation medication was discontinued in 14 patients (53.8%) and 1 patient suffered form <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of embolism event in Group R is significantly higher than in Group S (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More patients discontinued anti-arrhythmic medication in Group S than in Group R (80.9% vs. 56.0%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Catheter ablation is associated with satisfactory long-term success rate, reduced anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> medication, improved quality of life in patients with paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
