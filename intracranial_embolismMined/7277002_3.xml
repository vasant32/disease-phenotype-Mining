<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> ipsilateral to angiographically documented internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions in the neck have been treated by the authors over the past 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete cerebral arteriography in each case demonstrated that the symptomatic ophthalmic artery was perfused exclusively by the ipsilateral external carotid artery (ECA), which invariably had an obstructive and/or ulcerative lesion and its origin, and/or an adjacent residual "stump" of the occluded ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In nine patients, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery branch emboli were visible on funduscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had angiographic evidence of intracranial embolization via the ophthalmic artery from the ECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although ipsilateral superficial temporal-muscle cerebral artery anastomosis in one patient, and endarterectomy of a contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in another patient, failed to relieve symptoms, endarterectomy of the ECA with resection of the "stump" of the occluded ICA effectively terminated symptoms in 10 of 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> drug therapy promptly abolished symptoms in four nonsurgical patients as well as in two patients with failed operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> beyond cervical carotid occlusions frequently results from microembolism via the ipsilateral ECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with this mechanism of postocclusion recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> can be identified on the basis of clinical history, ophthalmological examinations, and complete cerebral arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Termination of embolic phenomena should be the major treatment goal in these individuals, and ECA endarterectomy is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> drugs are an effective alternative treatment in patients who are poor surgical risks </plain></SENT>
