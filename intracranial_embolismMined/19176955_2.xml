<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Contrast transesophageal echocardiography (c-TEE) and contrast transcranial Doppler (c-TCD) are useful diagnostic tools for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> (RLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the diagnostic accuracy of c-TCD for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between the size of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> determined by c-TEE and c-TCD findings and assessed the detectable rate of RLS by c-TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed RLS three times using simultaneous c-TCD and c-TEE in 107 patients (321 examinations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We classified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of ultrasound examinations into three groups by size according to microbubbles on c-TEE, such as no <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> (0 microbubble), small <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> (1-29 microbubbles) and large <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> (&gt;or=30 microbubbles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also calculated the number of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) on c-TCD and evaluated the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> size on c-TEE and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> count on c-TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the present study, c-TEE detected RLS in 105 (33%; small <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, n = 78; large <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, n = 27), and c-TCD detected RLS in 49 (15%) of 321 examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 78 examinations with small <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were found in only 19 (24%) on c-TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 27 examinations with large <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were found on c-TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, c-TCD were able to detect <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in 3 of 216 examinations among the no-<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When &gt;or=2 MES on c-TCD was established as the cutoff to predict large <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> on c-TEE, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 96.3, 96.8, and 96.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When two or more <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were determined by c-TCD, large <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> could be accurately diagnosed </plain></SENT>
