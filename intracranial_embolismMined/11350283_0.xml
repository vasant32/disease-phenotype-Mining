<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> are often due to large middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarctions, caused by cardiogenic emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterise the large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarctions and to describe the prevalence and prognostic value of the hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patient material comprised <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 449 patients included in a randomised clinical trial of low molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> versus aspirin in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score &lt;8 were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT was performed on admission and at day 7, and was evaluated blinded to clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CT findings on admission were related to functional outcome at 14 days and 3 months, and incidence of cerebral haemorrhage within 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Altogether 66/449 (15%) of the patients had large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients had poorer clinical outcomes, and a higher frequency of haemorrhage on control CT within 7 days (15/59, 26% vs. 43/368, 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HMCAS was found in 32/449 (7%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was significantly more frequent in patients with large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarctions (17/66, 26% vs. 15/383, 4%), and was found most frequently within the first few hours following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The HMCAS was associated with poor clinical outcomes and a higher frequency of cerebral haemorrhage, but these effects were partially explained by a preponderance of other risk factors in the HMCAS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction is a frequent finding in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patients have a high prevalence of the HMCAS, which is an early infarction sign and a marker of a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
