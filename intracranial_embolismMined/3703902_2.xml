<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rats with cerebral embolization were markedly impaired acquisition and retention of the one-trial passive avoidance response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impairment depended on the number of microspheres injected and continued for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebral embolized rats were also impaired acquisition of two-way active avoidance response in a shuttle box </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These impairments are not due to decrease in shock sensitivity, because there was no significant change in the flinch-jump threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The embolized rats also exhibited a significant disturbance in performance of water filled multiple T-maze learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rats with cerebral embolization are impaired in three different types of learning tasks, and may be useful as an animal model for the vascular type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
