<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight patients (5 males, 3 females, mean age 66 +/- 12 years) with haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 13 male patients (mean age 73 +/- 10 years) with thrombo-embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> underwent 24-hour blood pressure monitoring in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage by the Takeda Medical 2420 (A&amp;D Co., Japan), programmed to measure blood pressure every 10 min during day-time and 15 min during night-time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure variability was measured by the variability coefficient (standard deviation/24 h mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases by Computed Tomography scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical differences between groups were evaluated by Student's "t" test for independent samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> the mean of variability coefficient proved be 10.7% for systolic and 12.8% for diastolic blood pressure, whereas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> it was 14.1% for systolic and 17.7% for diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference between means was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.02 for systolic and p &lt; 0.01 for diastolic blood pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure variability is greater in thrombo-embolic, than haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hypervariability can be misleading in judging the hypertensive state in this condition </plain></SENT>
