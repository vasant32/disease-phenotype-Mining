<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Unintentional intracerebral embolization is a serious, ever present threat during neurointerventional procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have devised a method to reduce this intraprocedural risk in vertebral artery interventions by creating a temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: For this technique, a temporary balloon occlusion catheter is advanced into the proximal subclavian artery via a femoral artery approach, while a second introducer catheter is passed into the target vertebral artery via an axillary artery access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The temporary occluding balloon is then inflated within the proximal subclavian artery, establishing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal</z:e> that diverts blood flow into the arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Permanent balloon occlusion of the vertebral artery can then be accomplished without fear of intracerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients with vertebrobasilar junction <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were successfully treated with detachable balloon embolization using this cerebral protection technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The permanent occlusion balloons were easily passed through the introducer catheter without difficulty despite reversed vertebral artery flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No complications were encountered, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were successfully occluded in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal</z:e> can be easily created to reduce the risk of cerebral embolic complications when performing interventional neuroradiological procedures in the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
