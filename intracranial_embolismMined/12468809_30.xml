<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been very limited studies on the usefulness of antiedemic agents as neuroprotective agents in the setting of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the neuroprotective effects of a new potent nonpeptide vasopressin receptor V(1) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, SR-49059, in a focal embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal ischemic injury was induced by embolizing a preformed clot into the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume was measured at 48 hours after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits, ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity, and mortality and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rates were also documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with SR-49059 (2 mg/kg), initiated immediately after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, significantly reduced infarction volume (P&lt;0.05) measured at 48 hours after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animals in which the treatment was delayed for 1 hour after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, infarction volume was also reduced significantly (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume in the rats that received the drug at 3 or 6 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was not different from that in the vehicle-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with SR-49059, when started early after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, also reduced neurological deficits and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Injection of drug at a higher dose (30 mg/kg) also reduced infarction volume and improved functional recovery but was not superior to the lower dose (2 mg/kg) when the drug was administrated at 1 hour after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the selective vasopressin receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SR-49059 is a potent neuroprotective agent when used early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in an embolic focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models to better understand its neuroprotective properties when used alone or in combination with thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
