<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study aim was to analyze long-term clinical and echocardiographic results obtained with CarboMedics mechanical valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2,953 patients underwent valve replacement with the CarboMedics valve between 1988 and 2004 at the Montreal Heart Institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were prospectively followed at the outpatient valve clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 1,004 patients underwent echocardiographic examinations during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 1,597 patients (mean age 57 +/- 12 years) underwent isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR), 1,043 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10 years) underwent isolated mitral valve replacement (MVR), and 313 patients (mean age 58 +/- 11 years) underwent AVR+MVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean five-, 10- and 15-year actuarial survival rates were 83 +/- 1%, 70 +/- 2% and 62 +/- 3% in AVR patients, 76 +/- 1%, 59 +/- 2% and 40 +/- 14% in MVR patients, and 68 +/- 3%, 51 +/- 4% and 33 +/- 9% in AVR+MVR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean 15-year freedom from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and reoperation was 95 +/- 1%, 97 +/- 1% and 95 +/- 1% in AVR patients, 92 +/- 1%, 97 +/- 1% and 93 +/- 1% in MVR patients, and 94 +/- 2%, 93 +/- 2% and 91 +/- 4% in AVR+MVR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AVR patients had a mean aortic gradient of 29 +/- 14, 20 +/- 8, 18 +/- 7, 16 +/- 7, 12 +/- 5 and 11 +/- 5 mmHg with 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29 mm prostheses, respectively (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MVR patients had a mean mitral gradient of 5.3 +/- 3, 4.9 +/- 2.2, 4.6 +/- 2, 4.4 +/- 2.9 and 4.9 +/- 1.8 mmHg with 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33 mm prostheses, respectively (p = 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patient survival and valve-related complications were satisfactory at 15 years after valve replacement with the CarboMedics valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean aortic gradients were high with the 19-mm aortic prostheses, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other valve sizes showed good hemodynamic performance, as measured using transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
