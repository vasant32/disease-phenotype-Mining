<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of seven patients with mean GCS = 14.2 and mean clinical grade = 1.85 affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> and in treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> were examined retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent subtemporal craniectomy plus closed drainage or burrhole(s) plus closed drainage after immediate correction of hypocoagulability by administration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> and fresh frozen plasma and normalization of PA by calcium <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Outcome was good for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients except one who died because of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> due to massive solid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> during extracorporeal dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications included: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, solid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo>, slow brain reexpansion, subdural collection reaccumulation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients required re-operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of hospital stay was 18 days with range from 7 to 24 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Basing on this retrospective study and the proposed pathophysiology, the guidelines for optimal management of this subgroup of patients are proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recommendations include the immediate correction of hypocoagulability, the appropriate surgical technique and the cautious conversion to oral anticoagulation as well as the appropriate timing of such conversion </plain></SENT>
