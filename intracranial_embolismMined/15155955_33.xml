<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> energy delivered using a low-energy infrared laser may be useful to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we determined whether transcranial laser therapy would improve behavioral deficits in a rabbit small clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model (RSCEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, the behavioral and physiological effects of laser treatment were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RSCEM was used to assess whether low-energy laser treatment (7.5 or 25 mW/cm2) altered clinical rating scores (behavior) when given to rabbits beginning 1 to 24 hours postembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral analysis was conducted from 24 hours to 21 days after embolization, allowing for the determination of the effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> dose (P50) or clot amount (mg) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the RSCEM, a treatment is considered beneficial if it significantly increases the P50 compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the present study, the P50 value for controls were 0.97+/-0.19 mg to 1.10+/-0.17 mg; this was increased by 100% to 195% (P50=2.02+/-0.46 to 2.98+/-0.65 mg) if laser treatment was initiated up to 6 hours, but not 24 hours, postembolization (P50=1.23+/-0.15 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laser treatment also produced a durable effect that was measurable 21 days after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laser treatment (25 mW/cm2) did not affect the physiological variables that were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that laser treatment improved behavioral performance if initiated within 6 hours of an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the effect of laser treatment is durable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, transcranial laser treatment may be useful to treat human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and should be further developed </plain></SENT>
