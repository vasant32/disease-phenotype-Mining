<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased downstream microembolization is expected in transapical aortic valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether it usually occurs, how often, and its clinical relevance are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the results of ultrasound microembolic signal detection in the middle cerebral artery during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients (mean age: 80 ± 5 years; mean EuroSCORE: 36 ± 13 %) underwent transapical aortic valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative transcranial Doppler (TCD) sound examination of both middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was used to identify high-intensity transient signals (HITS) and microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) during seven phases of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative computed tomography of the brain and clinical neurological examinations were performed preoperatively and daily during the first postoperative week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the procedure, HITS [right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>: 435 ± 922 (range 9-5765); left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>: 471 ± 996 (range 24-6432)] and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> [right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>: 78 ± 172 (range 1-955); left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>: 62 ± 190 (range 2-1553)] were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were recorded during valvuloplasty [right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>: 3 ± 5.6 (range 0-31); left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>: 2 ± 4.9 (range 0-30)] and positioning of the prosthetic valve in the aortic position [right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>: 6 ± 5 (range 0-22); left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>: 2 ± 6.9 (range 0-38)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, there were no clinical signs of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral microemboli were detected by intraoperative transcranial Doppler sound examinations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during transapical aortic valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of the signals were detected during balloon valvuloplasty and delivery of the prosthetic valve </plain></SENT>
