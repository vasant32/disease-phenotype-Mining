<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been admitted to the Neurology Service, First Teaching Hospital, Beijing Medical College from January 1, 1976, to December 31, 1978, and were followed up for 1 to 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The series included 217 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, 54 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 35 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The life-table method was used to determine the cumulative survival rate (CSR), cumulative marked improvement rate (CMIR), and cumulative recurrence rate (CRR), for each of these three types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main results were the following: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was not significantly influenced by sex, BP level on admission, or type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age was an important prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival rate decreased significantly in each successive age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, age was not a risk factor for recurrence or poor improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cumulative survival rate, cumulative marked improvement rate, and cumulative recurrence rate did not differ significantly among <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
