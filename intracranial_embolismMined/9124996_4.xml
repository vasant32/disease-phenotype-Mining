<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microsphere embolism was induced by injection of 900 microspheres (48 microns in diameter) into the right internal carotid artery of rats, and changes in the energy metabolism of the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus of the right hemisphere were determined without and with nebracetam treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microsphere embolism induced increases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> contents and decreases of ATP and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphate contents in these regions, suggesting that sustained impairment of cerebral energy metabolism occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes were gradually reversed with time after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of microsphere-injected rats with 30 mg/kg of nebracetam, p.o., twice a day, was started one day after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of treatment with nebracetam on cerebral energy metabolites were determined on the 3rd and 7th day after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of microsphere-injected rats with nebracetam significantly improved these variables on the 3rd day after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but the improvement was small on the 7th day, except for reversal of the hippocampal ATP content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that nebracetam is a possible therapeutic agent for the restoration of cerebral energy metabolism against microsphere-induced, sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
