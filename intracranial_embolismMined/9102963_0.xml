<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our knowledge of this condition has increased, however, along with the development of better radiological methods for visualization of the brain and its vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography, computed tomography (CT) and, in particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have made it easier to diagnose this condition earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has thus been discovered that <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> occurs more frequently than previously supposed and shows a wide variation of the clinical spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a series of eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> who were admitted to the Neurosurgical Department, Haukeland Hospital, over a period of three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presentation shows the great variation in the clinical and radiological picture of this disease and the consequent diagnostic and therapeutic challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this diagnosis should be considered in patients with cerebral symptoms of uncertain cause, and that MRI is an important tool in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
