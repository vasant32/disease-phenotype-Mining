<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were among 13 patients observed from eight to 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case 1: A 56-year-old man was diagnosed as having apical HCM at the age of 49 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> and prominent ST-T changes were observed on ECG during his first admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was 24 mmHg and a left ventriculo-gram revealed a decrease in the left ventricular cavity in the apex and marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the apical wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moderate interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> or disarray of myocytes was observed in a left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> he was successfully resuscitated at the age of 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the age of 55 years, two-dimensional echocardiography revealed thinning and abnormal motion in the apical wall, and a defect in 201T1 accumulation was observed in the same region by perfusion scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This patient was readmitted with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> at the age of 56 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LVEDP (8 mmHg), and a left ventriculogram revealed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the left ventricular apex with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> major epicardial coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>He has been under treatment with antiarrhythmic medications, calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, and has become relatively asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Case 2: A 69-year-old-man was diagnosed as having apical HCM after a complete evaluation, including cardiac catheterization, at the age of 59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>His LVEDP was elevated (17 mmHg), and a left ventricular angiogram revealed marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> localized to the apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction was 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy revealed interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, he has been followed as a New York Heart Association functional class III to IV with occasional elevation of cardiac enzymes but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes in his ECGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> developed at the age of 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Apical wall thinning and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesis</z:hpo> were diagnosed by 2D echocardiography and a defect in the 201T1 accumulation was observed at about 65 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>He was readmitted in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> at the age of 69 years, and he was diagnosed as having cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 35 mmHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
