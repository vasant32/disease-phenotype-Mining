<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To increase the sensitivity of MRI parameters to detect tissue damage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, an unsupervised analysis method, Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA), was applied to analyze the temporal evolution of ischemic damage in a focal embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model in rat with and without recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats subjected to embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were investigated using a 7-T MRI system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomized into control (n=9) and treated (n=9) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treated rats received rt-PA via a femoral vein at 4 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ISODATA analysis employed parametric maps or weighted images (T1, T2, and diffusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ISODATA results with parametric maps are superior to ISODATA with weighted images, and both of them were highly correlated with the infarction size measured from the corresponding histological section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the average map ISODATA lesion sizes were 37.7+/-7.0 and 39.2+/-5.6 mm2 for the treated and the control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average histological infarction areas were 37.9+/-7.4 mm2 for treated rats and 39.4+/-6.1 mm2 for controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The R2 values of the linear correlation between map ISODATA and histological data were 0.98 and 0.96 for treated and control rats, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both histological and map ISODATA data suggest that there is no significant difference in infarction area between non-treated and rt-PA-treated rats when treatment was administered 4 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ISODATA lesion size analysis was also sensitive to changes of lesion size during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that the multiparameter map ISODATA approach provides a more sensitive quantitation of the ischemic lesion at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points than image ISODATA and single MRI parametric analysis using T1, T2 or ADCw </plain></SENT>
