<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of more intensive medical therapy on the rate of transcranial Doppler (TCD) microemboli and cardiovascular events in patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (ACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Four hundred sixty-eight patients with ACS greater than 60% by Doppler peak velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared (1) the proportion of ACS patients who had microemboli on TCD, (2) cardiovascular events, (3) rate of carotid plaque progression, and (4) baseline medical therapy, before and since 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 468 ACS patients, 199 were enrolled between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2002; and 269 were enrolled between January 1, 2003, and July 30, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were present in 12.6% before 2003 and 3.7% since 2003 (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decline in microemboli coincided with better control of plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and slower progression of carotid total plaque area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since 2003, there have been significantly fewer cardiovascular events among patients with ACS: 17.6% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or carotid endarterectomy for symptoms before 2003, vs 5.6% since 2003 (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of carotid plaque progression in the first year of follow-up has declined from 69 mm(2) (SD, 96 mm(2)) to 23 mm(2) (SD, 86 mm(2)) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular events and microemboli on TCD have markedly declined with more intensive medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Less than 5% of patients with ACS now stand to benefit from revascularization; patients with ACS should receive intensive medical therapy and should only be considered for revascularization if they have microemboli on TCD </plain></SENT>
