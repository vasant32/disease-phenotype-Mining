<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While evidence suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> has an independent relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, similar findings for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between body mass index and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> independently of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1965, the Honolulu Heart Program has followed a cohort of men in a prospective study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article examines the relationship between the baseline measurement of body mass index and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> in 1163 nonsmoking men in older middle age (55 to 68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men who had an elevated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and other risk factors were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 22 years of follow-up, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increased significantly with increasing levels of body mass (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the bottom tertile of the body mass index, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> was 28.7 per 1000 (11/383) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the middle tertile, the rate was increased by 40% to 40.7 per 1000 (16/393), and in the top tertile, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> was 55.4 per 1000 (21/387), a twofold excess compared with the bottom tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age and the residual effects of confounding risk factors, including systolic blood pressure and serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, the estimated relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for the average body mass index in the top tertile (26.6 kg/m2) compared with that in the bottom tertile (20.3 kg/m2) was 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 4.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings were not affected by coronary events that occurred in the course of follow-up, nor did they appear to be influenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that elevated body mass is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> in nonsmoking men in older middle age who are free of commonly observed conditions related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
