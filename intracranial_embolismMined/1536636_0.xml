<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two patients, arteriography demonstrated minimal carotid plaque without evidence of significant stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The third patient did have high-grade stenosis of the petrous portion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery, but arteriography demonstrated a branch <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> corresponding to the territory of the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although most authors suggest that watershed territory infarctions arise from hemodynamic events, cerebral embolization may be a common cause </plain></SENT>
