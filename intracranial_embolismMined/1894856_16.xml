<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In three cases, three distinct mechanisms of right to left interatrial shunting in the absence of right ventricular systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were identified: 1) transient spontaneous reversal of the left to right atrial pressure differential with each cardiac cycle; 2) sustained elevation of right atrial pressure above left atrial pressure induced by respiratory maneuvers; and 3) aberrant flow redirection across the foramen ovale due to a large right atrial mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Any of these three mechanisms may be operative during paradoxic embolism in the absence of elevation of right ventricular pressures </plain></SENT>
