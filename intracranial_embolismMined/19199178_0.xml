<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In vascular surgery, intraoperative monitoring of the brain is recommended when the internal carotid artery (ICA) is clamped, because brain damage by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and embolism is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clamping of the ICA results in embolic or ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> in about 7 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic routine insertion of an intraluminal shunt can cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> and does not reduce the occurrence of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, a shunt should only be inserted, if critical reduction of cerebral perfusion is evident after clamping the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurement of carotid stump pressure is an invasive method to estimate perfusion of the brain hemisphere at the clamping side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial doppler sonography (TCD) measures the mean blood flow velocity in the ACI, but practicability is suffering from technical problems in 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, TCD is useful for detecting intraoperative embolism and postoperative hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes of oxyhaemoglobine and desoxyhaemoglobine concentration in brain tissue can be measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with wavelengths between 700 and 1000 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NIRS measurement is easily performed and reacts quickly to changes of brain tissue oxygenation, but there is still lacking evidence and at present a general recommendation of its application in vascular surgery is not justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) is the most widespread cerebral neuromonitoring during vascular surgery due to its high reliability and simple application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specifity for ischemic lesions are 100% and 94%-99%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SEP are regarded as the gold standard for cerebral neuromonitoring in anaesthetized patients </plain></SENT>
