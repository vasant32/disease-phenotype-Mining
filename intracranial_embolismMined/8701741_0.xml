<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 1 week and 2 week, the extent of neurologic deficits of rats was evaluated and after 24 h and 48 h the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the features of neurologic deficits and infarction were similar to those of the rat focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model established by Tamura et al (1981) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formed in our experiment is combined-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antithrombotic effect of aspirin and the thrombolytic effect of urokinase were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aspirin (50 mg.kg-1) was given by duodenum 30 min before adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> to the surface of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and urokinase (4000 U.kg-1, iv) was given 30 min after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After operation, the behavior of rats were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was evaluated 24 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The infarcted areas in the aspirin and the urokinase groups were reduced to 20% and 11% those of the control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neurologic deficits were also attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that this rat model may be used for testing not only antithrombotic but also thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
