<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Intracardiac thrombus</z:e> has received the most attention as a potential source of recurrent emboli, and in the past, it was considered a relative contra-indication to tissue plaminogen activator (t-PA) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recent data show that recurrent embolization from a cardiac source during t-PA infusion is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: This article describes recurrent symptomatic basilar artery embolization during t-PA infusion from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the proximal cervical vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This case provides evidence that intravenous t-PA must be used cautiously in the presence of large proximal thrombo-embolic sources and that intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in a large cervical artery should be considered one such source </plain></SENT>
