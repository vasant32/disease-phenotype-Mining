<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except 1 of the cases in this series were born at, or near to, term, were vertex presentations, and were normally grown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> followed instrumental delivery and in 5, at least one mode of assisted delivery had failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whilst some evidence of cranial trauma was present in 7 cases, only 3 had skull fractures and 7 showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, although this was described as minor in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emboli of brain tissue were identified in the pulmonary circulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fragments of brain were also seen in vessels of other organs, in particular the heart, in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Emboli were highlighted by immunostaining for glial fibrillary acid protein </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>Disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> is a frequent association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Extensive sampling for histology, particularly of the lungs and coronary vessels, is essential if this condition is not to be missed </plain></SENT>
