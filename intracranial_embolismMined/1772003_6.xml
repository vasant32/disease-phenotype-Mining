<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study group comprised 258 patients diseased during the period February 1st 1986-January 31th 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of various forms of hospital beds and non-hospital facilities in open care utilized during the first post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> year was analysed at 1986 year's cost level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean utilization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hospital beds during the initial phase was 15 days; at an expenditure cost of 26,670 SEK ($3,683) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean utilization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hospital and of geriatric beds during the first year was 19 and 59 days respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus the total hospital bed days amounted to a mean of 78 days; at a mean expenditure of 87,0000 SEK ($12,000); 70% of the patients were discharged from hospital care to independent living after 36 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care hospital provided 36% and geriatric care 64% of the beds needed before discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expenditure of non-hospital facilities was mean 19,000 SEK ($2600); thus total expenditure for health care amounted to 106,000 SEK ($14,600) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relation between non-hospital and hospital care was approximately 1 to 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> influenced markedly the pattern and the total utilization of both hospital and non-hospital care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> utilized health care resources at an expenditure 3.5 times that used by patients with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age of the patient also influenced health care utilization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
