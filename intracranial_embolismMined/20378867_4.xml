<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The benefit of endovascular revascularization of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) secondary division (M2) occlusions as compared with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk (M1) occlusions is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, we compared revascularization status and clinical outcomes in patients with angiographically confirmed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> M1 versus isolated M2 occlusions treated with mechanical thrombectomy using the Merci Retriever devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the pooled data of patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> from the Mechanical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>Embolus</z:mpath> Removal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral Ischemia</z:hpo> (MERCI) and Multi MERCI trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient data were dichotomized into 2 groups: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> M1 occlusions and isolated M2 occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics, revascularization rates, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rates, complications, outcomes, and mortality were evaluated for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 178 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion treated in the MERCI and Multi MERCI trials, 84.3% had M1 lesions and 15.7% had isolated M2 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with isolated M2 occlusions were revascularized at a higher rate, required a lower mean number of passes, and were associated with a trend toward shorter mean procedure time than patients with M1 occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found between M2 and M1 groups for symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, clinically significant procedural adverse events, favorable 90-day outcome, or 90-day mortality, although in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances, the M2 outcomes were numerically better than those in M1 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, final revascularization was the strongest independent predictor of good outcome at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> M1 occlusions and isolated M2 occlusions can achieve a relatively high rate of revascularization and favorable clinical outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In fact, patients with isolated M2 occlusions had a higher rate of revascularization, required fewer passes, and had no increased complications compared with patients with M1 occlusions </plain></SENT>
