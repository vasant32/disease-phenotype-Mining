<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To prove the effectiveness of a new stent concept with integrated protection (MembraX [MX]) by comparing it with five cerebral protection devices designed for carotid angioplasty in an in vitro model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two simulation series of embolization from carotid angioplasty have been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first series, polyvinyl-alcohol particles (150-250 microm [small], 355-500 microm [medium], 710-1000 microm [large]; 5 mg each) were injected into a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> flow model simulating the aortic arch with a carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The particles were injected proximally to the partially deployed MX stent or one of the following protection devices: Angioguard (AG), FilterWire EX (EX), Trap, Neuroshield (NS), or GuardWire Plus (GW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Particles evading the protection device were caught in a filter at the end of the flow model and weighed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second series, human plaque material (8-12 particles; total weight 6.09 +/- 0.01 mg; 500-1500 microm) was injected into the model with the respective devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MX was compared with the AG, EX, Trap, and NS devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MX had the most effective overall filtration performance for polyvinyl alcohol particles in the effluent of the internal carotid artery (ICA; 0.43 mg, 2.9%), compared with NS (0.53 mg, 3.5%), GW (1.10 mg, 7.0%), EX and AG (1.18 and 1.21 mg, respectively; 7.8% and 8.0%), and Trap (1.24 mg, 8.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MX performed best for the small particles (2.0% passed particles into ICA; P &lt; .05 compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Human plaque material was retained best in the in vitro model by MX (0.0%), followed by NS (0.8%), EX (1.3%), Trap (2.6%), and AG (4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In vitro, none of the tested devices had the ability to prevent embolization completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparing current designs, the MX device captured the highest percentage of the three different particle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Tested with human plaque emboli, MX performed effectively in filtering the particles in the ICA </plain></SENT>
