<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In order to reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during aortic replacement through a left thoracotomy, we performed ascending or arch aortic cannulation (AAC) as well as early extracorporeal perfusion (EEP) under deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> (DHCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the effectiveness of these modifications in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> after distal arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2006 and March 2010, 40 patients underwent distal arch replacement through a left thoracotomy, using 2 pieces of an artificial graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, AAC, EEP, and the open technique for aortic anastomosis were performed under DHCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AAC resulted in the proximal aortic perfusion from the proximal site of the diseased aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EEP was induced by aortic distal perfusion from the side branch of a distal graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After completion of the proximal anastomosis under EEP and DHCA, anastomosis between the proximal and distal grafts was made during rewarming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit in the brain and spinal cord, as well as early surgical results, were clinically evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no permanent neurologic deficit after the surgery in the operative survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> occurred in 1 and 2 patients, respectively (7.7%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients were able to walk prior to their discharge from hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality in this series was 5.0% (2 of 40 patients); the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was rupture of an <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcer</z:mp> and cardiogenic shock possibly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The AAC and EEP, in addition to deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and DHCA, minimized the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> after distal arch aortic replacement by the left lateral approach </plain></SENT>
