<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After cardioversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> is increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is little knowledge about the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> for patients with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided cardioversion under oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and TEE-guided cardioversion were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed serial TEE studies, Holter electrocardiography, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical examinations during a period of 4 weeks before and after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral anticoagulation was continued or initiated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the observation period 6 of 127 (4.7%) patients had new embolic lesions after cardioversion documented on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with an event were significantly older (P = .04) and had a larger left atrium (P = .04) than patients without event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and oral anticoagulation have a low rate of clinical apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> after TEE and anticoagulation-guided cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> is almost 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age and left atrial size are predictors for an event </plain></SENT>
