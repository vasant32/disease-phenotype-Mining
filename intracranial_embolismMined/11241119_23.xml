<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The role of percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of carotid bifurcation lesions has been limited by its potential for producing embolic debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy of a proximal occlusion catheter (POC) in the prevention of embolic events during carotid artery stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, pressure measurements relevant to the clinical application of this device were obtained from 10 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The POC is a guiding catheter with an occlusion balloon attached on the outside of the catheter at its distal end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the common carotid artery (CCA) was achieved by inflating the balloon while access to carotid bifurcation lesions was obtained through the inner lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The POC was inserted in the CCA of 10 dogs via the femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The side port of the POC was connected to a sheath placed in the femoral vein, thereby creating an external arteriovenous shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten artificial radiopaque particles simulating embolic particles and contrast agent were introduced in the CCA and monitored fluoroscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a control, the same procedure was performed with a standard guiding catheter without an occlusion balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, the internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery stump pressures and the pressure in the internal jugular vein were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Without the external arteriovenous shunt, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals there was prograde flow in the distal CCA despite CCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This flow was derived from the thyroid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, once the arteriovenous shunt was activated, reversal of flow in the distal CCA was achieved in each animal, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the artificial particles were recovered from the side port of the POC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the control group, each particle embolized to the brain (100%, P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the patients, the mean stump pressures in the ICA and external carotid artery and the jugular vein pressure were 51.8 +/- 14.2, 62.2 +/- 15.1, and 6.5 +/- 3.5 mm Hg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In each case, the jugular vein pressure was the lowest among the three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Obtaining proximal CCA control by inflating the POC does not sufficiently prevent embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, reversal of flow in the ICA can always be created with the external shunt, which effectively prevents embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, POC may markedly lower procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates during carotid artery stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The ability of POC to prevent embolization before crossing the lesion with a guidewire may be an important advantage over other distal protection devices </plain></SENT>
