<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Increasing evidence points to the inflammatory character of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and several parameters of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> have been proposed as cardiovascular risk markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed associations among serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations, carotid plaque structure, and immunocytology, and neurologic symptoms in patients with high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in a referral center and institutional practice in hospitalized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 62 patients with greater than 70% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> treated surgically; 58% of patients had symptoms, and 42% did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum hs-CRP concentrations were determined 48 hours before surgery; levels greater than 10 mg/L were considered pathologic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic analysis (stable or unstable) and immunohistochemistry (macrophage count, T lymphocytes, activated T lymphocytes) were carried out on the atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median hs-CRP values were 7.6 mg/L (range, 0-165 mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median hs-CRP concentrations were higher in patients with unstable plaque (53.2%) than in patients with stable plaque (46.7%): 27.1 mg/L (range, 1.8-165 mg/L) versus 4.1 mg/L (range, 0.3-56 mg/L) (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with symptomatic disease, 81% had CRP concentrations significantly higher than CRP concentrations in patients with asymptomatic disease (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant association was found between hs-CRP levels and the presence of macrophages (Spearman rank correlation [rho], 0.61, P &lt;.001) and T lymphocytes in the plaque (Spearman rank correlation [rho], 0.52, P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At logistic regression analysis, neurologic event and macrophages in the plaque were independently associated with unstable plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased hs-CRP levels may be related to the presence of macrophages and T lymphocytes in plaque, which is associated with the phenomena of instability that can lead to development of an ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus determination of circulating hs-CRP levels may be a useful additional marker of risk in patients with high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
