<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted an in vitro performance study to test the flow-directed Spinnaker microcatheter for potential endovascular embolizations with Ethibloc as embolic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed in vitro testing using 50 Spinnaker 1.8F hydrophilic infusion microcatheters of three different types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As embolic agent, different mixtures of Ethibloc and Lipiodol (E/L 1:1, 1:2, 1:3) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an in vitro setting, each catheter was injected to a maximum of ten times (E/L 1:1, n = 20 catheters; E/L 1:2, n = 20; E/L 1:3, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated the thinner Spinnaker 1.5F microcatheter (165/20, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five Spinnaker 1.5F catheters were each injected with a mixture of Ethibloc and Lipiodol (E/L 1:2 and 1:3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When a mixture of E/L 1:1 was used, 9 of 20 (45%) Spinnaker 1.8F microcatheters ruptured distally near the tip of the microcatheter, each during injection nos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One Spinnaker 1.8F was distally occluded after the fifth injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a mixture of E/L 1:2, 4 of 20 (20%) Spinnaker 1.8F microcatheters ruptured distally, during injection no. 6 (n = 2), 7 (n = 1), and 8 (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a mixture of E/L 1:3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ten Spinnaker 1.8F microcatheters could be injected without any problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ten microcatheters of the thinner Spinnaker 1.5F ruptured (10-18 cm proximally to the catheter tip) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This in vitro study using the flow-directed Spinnaker microcatheter revealed that microcatheters can rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Spinnaker 1.8F can rupture when a mixture of Ethibloc and Lipiodol 1:1 or 1:2 and more than four injections are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The Spinnaker 1.8F does not rupture when a mixture of E/L 1:3 is used, or with a mixture of E/L 1:1 or 1:2 and injecting to a maximum of four times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The Spinnaker 1.5F microcatheter is not suitable for embolizations using Ethibloc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For embolizations with Ethibloc we therefore recommend the use of a guidewire-directed microcatheter </plain></SENT>
