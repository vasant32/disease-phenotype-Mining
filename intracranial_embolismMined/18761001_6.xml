<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since CEPO has not been systematically studied in a fully blinded and randomized manner in an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, we determined if CEPO would be useful to attenuate clinical deficits associated with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> using the rabbit small clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model (RSCEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rabbits were embolized and treated with vehicle or CEPO within 6 h of embolization and behavioral analysis was conducted 48 h after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using quantal analysis, we determined the quantity of blood clot (mg) in brain that produce neurologic dysfunction in 50% of the rabbits (P(50)), with intervention considered beneficial if it increased the P(50) compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CEPO administered between 5 min and 3 h after embolization significantly (p&lt;0.05) improved behavioral function and increased the P(50) value by 55-216% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, CEPO administration did not improve behavior when administered 6 h following embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in the RSCEM, CEPO had a therapeutic window of at least 3 h, where it effectively improved clinical rating scores and motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that CEPO may be useful to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and supports the study of CEPO in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
