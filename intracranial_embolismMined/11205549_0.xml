<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Approximately 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> are due to cardioembolism and occur more frequently in the younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine the clinical characteristics and course of cardioembolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (ICCE) comparing them with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> due to other aetiologies (ICNCE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We made a prospective study of 354 patients admitted to hospital over a period of one year, after excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischaemia</z:e> and parenchymatous/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups were established: ICCE (29.4%) and ICNCE (70.6%), comparing age, sex, risk factors and course of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently a study lasing two years was done to assess the recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ICCE patients were older (75.89 compared with 72.58, p = 0.004), often know the exact time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of their symptoms (p = 0.015) and usually are admitted to hospital during the first six hours of their illness (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly higher incidence of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> or auricular <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> (p = 0.0052); p = 0.005); more complications arose (p = 0.000); stay in hospital was longer (13.62 as compared to 11.8 days; p = 0.035), there was a lower weekly BI score (p = 0.0023) and higher mortality (p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of 70 patients evaluated two years later 11 cases recurred, with no difference observed between the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anti-aggregant groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ICCE occurs in older patients, they develop worse neurological defects, have a worse short-term prognosis, develop more complications and have significantly greater mortality </plain></SENT>
