<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> disruption of atherosclerotic plaques precedes the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical syndromes, and studies have implicated a role for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish the character, level, and expression of MMPs in carotid plaques and to correlate this with clinical status, cerebral embolization, and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plaques were obtained from 75 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and divided into 4 groups according to symptomatology (group 1, asymptomatic; group 2, symptomatic &gt;6 months before surgery; group 3, symptomatic within 1 to 6 months; group 4, symptomatic within 1 month) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent preoperative and intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plaques were subjected to histological examination and quantification of MMPs by zymography and ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The level of MMP-9 was significantly higher in group 4 (median 125.7 ng/mL for group 4, median &lt;32 ng/mL for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups; P=0.003), with no difference in the levels of MMPs 1, 2, or 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the MMP-9 concentration was significantly higher in plaques undergoing spontaneous embolization (P=0.019) and those with histological evidence of plaque instability (P&lt;0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization demonstrated increased MMP-9 expression in highly symptomatic plaques in areas of intense inflammatory infiltrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The concentration, production, and expression of MMP-9 is significantly higher in unstable carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If this proves to be a causal relationship, MMP-9 may be a strong candidate for pharmacotherapy aimed at stabilizing plaques and preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
