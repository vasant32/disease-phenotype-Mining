<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (67 +/- 13 years) were examined by CBF SPECT with 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> 4.5 +/- 3.1 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the anteroposterior length of the cerebral hemisphere to that of the severe ischemic region, which was defined as an area of clear-cut severe reduction in CBF as observed by SPECT, was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One week after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was measured in the same manner by CT, and the relationship between the two measurements was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CBF in the region of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the surrounding region was determined by the Patlak plot method, and the affected/non-affected (A/NA) ratio was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In severe ischemic regions the CBF ranged from 1.7 ml/100 g/min to 20 ml/100 g/min (mean, 11 +/- 5 ml/100 g/min), whereas the A/NA ratio ranged from 4% to 45% (mean, 26 +/- 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the CBF in the surrounding regions ranged from 20 ml/100 g/min to 52 ml/100 g/min (mean, 34 +/- 8 ml/100 g/min) whereas the A/NA ratio ranged from 52% to 104% (mean, 77 +/- 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The coefficient of correlation between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size predicted by SPECT and that measured by CT was r = 0.986, and the correlation equation was Y = 1.047X - 2.969 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CBF SPECT performed in the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage can be used to predict the size of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
