<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study characterized diffusion-weighted, T2-weighted, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI appearances of hemorrhagic transformation within 5 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in experimental embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apparent diffusion coefficients and MRI signal characteristics were noted within corresponding regions of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> observed on gross pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apparent diffusion coefficients were significantly increased within hemorrhagic lesions, but were still within the expected range for bland <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The appearance of the hemorrhagic lesions on diffusion-weighted MRI was also very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and not very useful for clinical screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other MRI modalities should be investigated, but computed tomography remains the only widely available clinical method of reliably detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
