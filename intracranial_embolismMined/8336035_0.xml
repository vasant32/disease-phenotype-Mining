<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We operated upon a 61-year-old female with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and bilateral coronary calcific ostial stenosis associated with porcelain aorta secondary to <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At operation, cardiopulmonary bypass was begun with profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using an occlusion balloon catheter inflated in the ascending aorta, the <z:mp ids='MP_0010522'>calcified aorta</z:mp> was incised with scissors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However accidentally the balloon was ruptured by intimal calcification of the ascending aorta, and cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued for 11 minutes under 20 degrees C <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extensive removal of the intimal calcification of the ascending aorta was performed with care and then, the aorta was clamped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve replacement and triple coronary bypass operation (SVG to LAD, SVG to LCX, GEA to RCA) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proximal anastomoses of the SVGs were made on the decalcified aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful and aortography revealed neither dissection nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> following extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_48'>decalcification</z:mpath> procedure of the ascending aorta, and the 3 grafts were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From the experience, we learned that extensive removal of calcification of the aorta can be successfully performed in porcelain aorta due to <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For CABG in <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> syndrome, the use of ITA is rarely possible, but the GEA may be a versatile graft </plain></SENT>
