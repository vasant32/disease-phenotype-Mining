<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain water content in the laser irradiation area (LIA) and Evans blue (EB) dye content in selected areas of the brain were measured for different laser power outputs from 0 to 250 mW after 5 minutes of photoradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree and nature of tissue damage was examined histologically and correlated with the laser power level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is significant brain damage, blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in LIA for laser power outputs in excess of 100 mW from the diffusion tip (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> in the LIA is strongly correlated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption indicated by the presence of EB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the cortical surface was more susceptible than deeper white matter regions to interstitial laser irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Possible indirect mechanisms of brain injury from interstitial laser irradiation are discussed </plain></SENT>
