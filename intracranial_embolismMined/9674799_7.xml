<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Early intervention remains the key to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients whose deficits would later resolve without intervention are exposed to the risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment without benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with transient deficits could be distinguished from patients with evolving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> on the basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements before any clinical distinction could be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three patients who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms and who underwent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT (XeCT) CBF studies within 8 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms (and before any clinical improvement) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients (15%) had a complete resolution of their symptoms within 24 hours (not related to treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight patients with deficits that resolved had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CBF in the symptomatic vascular territories (mean time to XeCT = 3 hours, 51 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean CBF in the regions of interest of the symptomatic vascular territories of patients who had deficits that resolved was 35.4 +/- 8.1 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) compared with 17.3 +/- 9.3 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) of patients with evolving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (p = 0.00058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ischemic neurologic deficits that will later resolve can be acutely distinguished from patients with evolving cortical infarctions using XeCT CBF measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CBF measurements may assist in the triage of patients for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy by selecting patients with a favorable prognosis and may not benefit from therapy but would still be exposed to the potential risks and expense of treatment </plain></SENT>
