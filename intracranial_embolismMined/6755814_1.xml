<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four dogs were exposed to multi-focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> sufficient to maintain suppression of the P1--N1 amplitude of the cortical sensory-evoked response (CSER) for 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the P1--N1 amplitude recovery of the CSER was followed for an additional 15, 60, or 120 min while the dogs were treated or left untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> promoted a statistically significant augmentation of CSER amplitude return relative to: 1) no treatment; 2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> alone; 3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> alone; 4) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>; 5) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>; 6) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Percentage gray matter water by the wet weight/dry weight technique was significantly elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> embolized groups compared to ten non-embolized controls, but the percentage recovery of the CSER did not correlate with the presence or degree of gray matter <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> among embolized animals followed for 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Separation of embolized animals by the presence or absence of "neuron-disabling" flows (defined as 0-15 ml/100 gm/min for gray matter and 0-6 ml/100 gm/min for white matter) did produce significantly different mean CSER percentage recoveries but percentage gray matter water in the two groups was comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A proposed explanation of the data is that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> engenders two parallel processes which may become uncoupled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> creates metabolic conditions that lead to increased cellular imbibition of water and produces increased vascular leakiness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These perturbations increase brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, there is an occurrence of further metabolic derangements and multifactorial interaction at the blood-endothelial interface which have a direct influence on neuronal function and recovery </plain></SENT>
