<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A forty-one-year-old man with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001048'>cavernous hemangioma</z:hpo> of the right cavernous sinus underwent a preoperative cerebral angiogram and a balloon occlusion test of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the operation to remove the cavernous sinus lesion, the ipsilateral electroencephalogram was found to be abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An embolic occlusion of the M2 and M3 segments of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A platelet and thromboembolus was removed via multiple incisions, and flow was restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cavernous sinus lesion was removed uneventfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of the operation, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was found to be reclotted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow was eventually restored by replacing the M2 segment of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> with a 2-cm saphenous vein graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered without any deficits of brain function and with transient deficits of Cranial Nerves III and VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the temporal and parietal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> embolectomy is unsuccessful, vein graft replacement should be considered to restore flow and to avoid major neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
