<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Physicians were mailed a questionnaire describing two simplified scenarios--one involving a patient with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and the other involving a patient with a life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each scenario there was one potential natural adverse outcome (which could be prevented with drug therapy) and one potential drug side effect (iatrogenic adverse outcome), which would be clinically indistinguishable from the natural adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half the respondents were given the probability of the natural adverse outcome (PN) and were asked to specify the probability of the iatrogenic adverse outcome (PI) at which they felt that giving and withholding the therapy were equivalent strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other respondents were given the PI and asked to specify the PN at which they felt the two strategies were equivalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Staff physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Results are expressed as the ratio PI/PN at which the respondent felt that giving and not giving therapy were equivalent strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A ratio less than 1 indicates that errors of commission (iatrogenic adverse outcomes) were given more weight than were errors of omission (natural adverse outcomes when therapy was withheld) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ratios less than 1 were provided in 56% of the responses (n = 230) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean PI/PN in the group with ratios less than 1 was 0.53 +/- 0.26 (SD; n = 129) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In making decisions, some physicians appear to weigh errors of commission more heavily than they do errors of omission, while others weigh them equally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This diversity of physicians' attitudes may explain some of the variation observed in clinical practice in settings where The possibility of iatrogenic complications is of concern </plain></SENT>
