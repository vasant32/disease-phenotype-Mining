<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In pharmacodynamic studies using focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> models, the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> measured by quantitative histology is the most important outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Precise, unbiased and reproducible assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume is of foremost importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A frequent problem in interventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models is the evaluation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in animals found dead, where instant post-mortem fixation of the brain cannot be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate possible bias from perfusion, immediate and 3-h post-mortem delayed immersion fixation on the measured volumes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and hemispheres in a rat embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were thromboembolized into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After survival for 24 h, the animals were divided into three groups: group 1 - immediate perfusion fixation; group 2 - immediate immersion fixation of the brain; and group 3 - animals left dead for 3 h at room temperature before removal of the brain for immersion fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following histological preparation and evaluation, the volumes of the hemispheres and infarction were measured by quantitative histology and planimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brains fixed by immersion were 7% larger than the perfusion-fixed brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delaying the immersion fixation for 3 h may increase hemisphere volume by a further 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent of the fixation procedure, the size of infarction was approximately 40% of the ipsilateral hemisphere, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> was approximately 11% of the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The used planimetric technique was accurate with measured values within +/- 2% of the factual value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, sizes of hemispheres, infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in absolute volume measures are influenced by the effect of unwanted variation of brain size caused by biological factors and artificial shrinkage caused by fixation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> and heat treatment of the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> expressed relatively in per cent of hemisphere and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, respectively, are robust measures independent of the investigated fixation procedures </plain></SENT>
