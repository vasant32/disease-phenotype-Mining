<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We describe and analyze flow dynamics and pressure relationships in an ulcerated atherosclerotic human carotid bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Replicas of an ulcerated atherosclerotic human carotid bulb were created using the lost wax technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The resulting replicas were placed in a circuit of pulsating non-Newtonian fluid and flows were adjusted to replicate human physiological flow profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Common carotid artery total flow volumes of 400, 600, and 800 mL/min were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slipstreams were opacified with isobaric dyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Images were recorded on 35 mm film and on super VHS video </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A pressure recording device was calibrated; data were received from needles placed radially and longitudinally in the common carotid artery, narrowed bulb/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, and internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple pressure recordings were obtained in the replicas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Measurements of the replica showed a 59% diameter stenosis and an 88% area stenosis of the carotid bulb with a shallow 3.3-mm <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of flow in the common carotid artery showed undisturbed slipstreams, but as these streams entered the narrowed carotid bulb they crowded together and accelerated significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This accelerated jet continued for at least two vessel diameters into the more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> portions of the internal carotid artery, where flow remained disturbed peripherally and often assumed a helical pattern but was nonturbulent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As fluid entered the narrowed bulb, radial pressures decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most important, at peak systole, lower radial pressure with a vortex circulation was found at the ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This combination of events (ie, slowly swirling fluid within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, allowing platelet aggregates to form, and the intermittent Bernoulli effect, pulling the aggregates into the rapidly flowing blood) may help explain how ulcerated carotid plaques lead to embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
