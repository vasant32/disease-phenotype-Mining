<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Approximately one quarter of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients notice the event at awakening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at awakening are usually excluded from thrombolysis, since the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> cannot be definitely identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the hyperacute CT findings of awakening <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to assess whether the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is shortly before awakening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who were consecutively admitted to our department within 3 h after the recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the period between January 2000 and March 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into three groups: group A with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of known <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, group B with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at awakening, and group C with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of unknown <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> due to lack of a witness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical and CT findings in each group were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 81 patients fulfilled the study criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 46 patients in group A, 17 patients in group B, and 18 patients in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in CT findings between groups A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group C, however, definite hypodense areas were more commonly found than in group A (56 vs. 0%; p&lt;0.001) or in group B (56 vs. 11%; p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on our CT findings, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at awakening seems to be developing shortly before in a large subset of patients, making them potential candidates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
