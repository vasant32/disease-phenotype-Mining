<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were studied using a closed cardiac (unvented heart) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 patients (no filters) had the highest incidence of gaseous microemboli, as indicated by the ultrasound microemboli index, at both high and low oxygen flow rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 2 patients (40-microns filters) had a significantly lower microemboli index, particularly at low oxygen flow rates (t = 4.9, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 25-microns group patients had the lowest values of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No microemboli were detected at low oxygen flow rates, and microemboli were detected in only 0.1% of the samples at high oxygen flow rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, observations on vented hearts in 3 patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery indicate that the origin of gaseous microemboli may be air trapped inside the heart </plain></SENT>
