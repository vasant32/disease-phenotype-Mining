<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mean dose of 1650 cGy was directed to the periphery of the lesion, which almost always corresponded to the 80% isodose line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean lesion diameter was 23 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six patients were treated with one isocenter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography, performed at 1 year after radiosurgery in 41 of the 48 eligible patients, revealed an overall complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rate of 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 1-year <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rate was highest in those patients with relatively small <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>'s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed at 2 years posttreatment in 21 of the 25 eligible patients, demonstrating an overall complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rate of 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This incidence did not correlate with lesion size: that is, large lesions (up to 35 mm in diameter) seemed just as likely to thrombose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients (2.5%) experienced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> at some time after radiosurgical treatment, and both recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients (2.5%) have sustained mild, but permanent, radiation-induced neurological complications </plain></SENT>
