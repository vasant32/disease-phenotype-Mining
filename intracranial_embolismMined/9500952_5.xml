<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine autoradiography, small ischemic foci were observed scattered throughout the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After correction for tracer diffusion from the surroundings, the ischemic regions located in the deeper parts of the brain were found to have a lower blood flow than the foci in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, the cortical foci were significantly smaller than those in the basal ganglia (the area where the average size of the foci was found to be largest) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results and conclusions of this work should aid in interpretation of future experiments with potential treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microinfarctions may well need different treatments depending on their localization </plain></SENT>
