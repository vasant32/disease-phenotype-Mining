<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine whether naftidrofuryl oxalate exerts a possible therapeutic effect on brain energy metabolism impaired by microsphere-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Injection of microspheres into the right carotid canal resulted in a decrease in tissue high-energy phosphates both in the right and left hemispheres, and an increase in tissue <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> in the right hemisphere, on the 3rd and the 5th day after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The embolism also induced a marked reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidative phosphorylation ability and succinate dehydrogenase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was induced in the brain by the microsphere administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of microsphere-injected rats with naftidrofuryl oxalate (15 mg kg-1) for 3 or 5 days elicited a significant recovery of tissue high-energy phosphate and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recovery was associated with a significant restoration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> succinate dehydrogenase activity on the both days and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidative phosphorylation rate on the 5th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that naftidrofuryl oxalate is beneficial in the recovery of cerebral energy metabolism impaired by microsphere-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, presumably through a mechanism involving its direct effect on the cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enzyme activities </plain></SENT>
