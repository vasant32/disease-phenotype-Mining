<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 214 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for IE was followed up for 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 65 patients (mean age, 52 years), IE was complicated by computed tomography- or magnetic resonance imaging-verified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=61) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perioperative (30-day) and long-term mortality was assessed with regression models adjusting for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete neurological recovery of IE survivors was defined by a modified Rankin score of &lt; or = 1 and a Barthel index of 20 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty of 61 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (81.9%) survived surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison with nonstroke patients, the age-adjusted perioperative mortality risk was 1.70-fold (95% CI, 0.73 to 3.96, P=0.22) higher and long-term mortality risk was 1.23-fold (95% CI, 0.72 to 2.11, P=0.45) higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, or brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>) showed a higher perioperative mortality rate (38.9% vs 8.5%, P=0.007) but no higher neurological complication rate than patients with uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete neurological recovery was achieved in 35 IE survivors (70%, 95% CI, 55% to 82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in the case of middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, recovery was only 50% and was significantly lower compared with non-middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Uncomplicated IE-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> showed a favorable prognosis with regard to both long-term survival and neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The formidable risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to cardiac surgery seems to be much lower than previously thought </plain></SENT>
