<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall neuropsychological (NP) change score declined at 6 days, showed some recovery at 8 weeks, and declined again at 5 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that even over a 5-year period, operative damage is detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' vulnerability to short-term deterioration and resilience or ability to recover over a few weeks from operative cerebral insult are important processes of unknown mechanisms </plain></SENT>
