<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The use of flow arrest as a means of providing cerebral protection during carotid angioplasty offers the advantages of improved efficiency of debris removal and the ability to provide protection under unfavorable (tortuous) anatomic circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to the filtration methods of cerebral protection, this modality requires complete interruption of antegrade carotid artery flow during balloon angioplasty and stent deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report our experience with 9 patients undergoing carotid angioplasty with the Mo.Ma device, which utilizes common and external carotid artery balloon occlusion during the angioplasty procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the clinical outcomes and intraprocedural hemodynamic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average duration of carotid occlusion was 8.3 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 9 patients, 2 patients (22%) experienced cerebral intolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in this patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There appeared to be a poor relationship between procedure intolerance and the presence of significant contralateral stenosis or low carotid back pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the incidence of postangioplasty <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> was not clearly related to cerebral intolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid angioplasty with stenting can be safely conducted with flow arrest as an alternative to filter-type cerebral protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, because cerebral intolerance is not an infrequent occurrence with this approach, clinicians must be cognizant of management strategies for transient cerebral intolerance </plain></SENT>
