<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (BATS) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003676'>progressive disorder</z:hpo> which may present with fluctuating neurological signs of varying degrees of severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unless the diagnosis is considered, the confused young patient may be thought to be under the influence of drugs or to be psychologically ill, and indeed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026785" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Munchausen syndrome</z:e> may be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The more elderly patient may be diagnosed simply as having had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper presents the cases of three patients admitted through the accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department of St Mary's Hospital, London with basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during a 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients demonstrated the classic triad for this syndrome of: (1) long tract neurological signs, (2) impaired conscious level, and (3) complex ocular signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concern is that, for patients with more subtle signs, a diagnosis of BATS may not be considered, and a neurological opinion may be thus delayed and no treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> or thrombolytic agents would be given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and improved, while in the third patients anticoagulation was judged inappropriate and the patients died from progression of the disease with respiratory complications </plain></SENT>
