<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The abundance of these lesions in an unknown, but presumably small, percentage of cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath>, along with the even more widespread distribution of embolic fat droplets throughout both white and gray matter, suggest that these lesions and emboli must have a profound effect on neurologic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> is by far a more common clinical manifestation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome and the neurologic involvement of such patients is often attributed to the secondary effects of generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following patient with overt respiratory and neurologic symptoms re-emphasizes the direct primary effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> within the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system as a cause of white matter <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
