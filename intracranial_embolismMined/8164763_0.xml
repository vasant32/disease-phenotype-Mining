<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data were also analysed for a possible relationship between variability of circadian blood pressure, site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and activation of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of hemodynamic origin, when compared to a control group, manifested significantly greater variability of circadian blood pressure (diastolic: -25.2 +/- 4.5% vs. -13.8 +/- 6.5%; p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who showed the greatest decrease in vasomotor reactivity (&lt; 40%) developed a prolonged disturbance of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This disturbance regressed slowly only after the pathological 24-hour blood pressure profile had normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By way of contrast, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, showed a distinctly decreased circadian blood pressure variability (diastolic: -5.2 +/- 6.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initially 40% of these patients presented a pathological increase of nocturnal blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Circadian blood pressure variability was positively correlated with serum concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (r = 0.79; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> affecting the insular cortex manifested an increase of nocturnal blood pressure significantly more often (66.7% vs. 11.8%; p &lt; 0.005), indicating increased sympathetic activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They had higher serum levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (540 +/- 110 pg/ml vs. 290 +/- 178 pg/ml) as compared to patients without damage to the insula and also a significantly higher incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT intervals</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
