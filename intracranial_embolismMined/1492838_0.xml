<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral embolisms</z:e> were induced in male Wistar rats by injection of 800 microspheres 50 microns in diameter via the left internal carotid artery under 2% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Daily oral administration of nefiracetam (30 mg/kg/d) was started 9 days after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nefiracetam caused significant (p &lt; 0.05) improvement of deficits in the learning of both water maze and passive avoidance tasks beginning 22 days after embolization of the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The drug also significantly restored decreases in cortical <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (p &lt; 0.05) and hippocampal glutamic acid decarboxylase activities (p &lt; 0.01) in the embolized cerebral hemisphere and significantly increased cortical <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (p &lt; 0.05) and acetylcholinesterase activities (p &lt; 0.05) in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere 21 days after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that nefiracetam improves <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in the late phase in embolized rats and suggest that the effect is at least partly due to the increase in glutamic acid decarboxylase, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltranseferase and acetylcholinesterase activities </plain></SENT>
