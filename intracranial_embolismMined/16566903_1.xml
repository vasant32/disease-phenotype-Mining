<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an effort to increase the objectivity and to further automate the ISODATA, MRI parameter maps were now employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and received treatment via a femoral vein at 4 h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control rats received saline and were sacrificed at 6, 24 and 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treated rats received rtPA alone or were treated with a combination of rtPA and an antibody, 7E3 F(ab')2, against the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> receptor that binds the platelet to fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These rats were sacrificed at 24, or 48, h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T1, T2 and diffusion maps were employed for map ISODATA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>H&amp;E histological analysis of coronal sections of tissue was performed and compared with map ISODATA from the corresponding sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ISODATA signatures were highly correlated (R approximately 0.80, P &lt; 0.0001) with the ischemic cell damage analyzed at 6, 24 and 48 h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 24 and 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, ISODATA lesion sizes were highly correlated (R &gt; 0.97, P &lt; 0.001) with lesion sizes measured histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination treatment of rtPA and 7E3 F(ab')2 reduced both infarction size (P &lt; 0.002) and average signature (P &lt; 0.03) at 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, compared to saline-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between saline and rtPA-alone-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The map ISODATA successfully provides objective and automated quantitation of the ischemic damage in both size and severity in an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model of rat with and without a therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
