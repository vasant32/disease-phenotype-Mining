<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to asses whether use of a Symmetry connector (St Jude Medical, Inc, St Paul, Minn) reduced intraoperative cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive patients underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients received at least one mechanical proximal vein graft anastomosis with a Symmetry aortic connector system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients representing the control group underwent operations with standard suturing techniques using partial aortic clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During surgical intervention, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were monitored continuously with multifrequency transcranial Doppler scanning, which detected and differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significantly more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in the Symmetry group (median, 36) compared with the control group (median, 11; P = .027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was due to a higher number of gaseous emboli in the Symmetry group than in the control group (median, 27 vs 8; P = .014), whereas there was no significant difference regarding the number of solid emboli (median, 7 vs 3; P = .139) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of a Symmetry connector system during proximal vein graft anastomosis increased the number of emboli to the brain compared with a standard technique in coronary bypass surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
