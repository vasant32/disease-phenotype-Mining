<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with high-risk CE sources or moderate-or-severe aortic atherosclerotic plaques on transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesion side and patterns on diffusion-weighted imaging were compared between CE and AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CE was identified in 123 and AE in 63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, right-sided lesions and corticosubcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were independently associated with CE, and left-sided lesions and pial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were independently associated with AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CE and AE have different radiological characteristics, as shown by the right-left propensity and lesions patterns of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
