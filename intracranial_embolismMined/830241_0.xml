<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an assessment of the pathogeneis of the condition, primacy is given to the role of arteriolar flow insufficiency and stress is laid on the long-standing capillaropathy which precedes the heamorrhagic phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basic therapeutic considerations are mentioned but stress is laid on the diagnosis of the pre-occlusive stage and on measures of a preventive nature that may be taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion and haemorrhagic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> are compared with regard to their pathogenesis and the advantages are discussed of a common ophthalmoscopic study of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion with neurologists interested in cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> leading to an interchange of therapeutic experience in both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, there are detailed the studies in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion being conducted by the Jerusalem Institute for the Prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>Blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These are studies of incidence, natural history and of pathogenesis as observed in the experimental disease produced in rhesus monkey </plain></SENT>
