<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study analyzes the role of the carotid endarterectomy (CEA)-produced common carotid step or shelf on early and late CEA outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A simple method of reconstruction that covers the exposed media and intima of the step and smooths out the flow channel is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1984 intraoperative geometric measurements were made on 1019 CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Duplex scans were made after surgery on 968 (95%); 234 (23%) were monitored for at least 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the first 920 CEA, 261 (28%) had a step &gt; or = 2 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the last 99 operations, the 27 (27%) with a step &gt; or = 2 mm had inversion plication reconstruction of the step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients had early post-CEA neurologic events attributed to a common carotid step, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and one had a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three had a CEA-produced step &gt; or = 2 mm (1.2% of 261, p = 0.03 when compared with no unexplained early neurologic events in the 659 without a step) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Duplex scans were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three except for a common carotid artery step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients had seven reoperations for common carotid artery restenosis at 23 to 104 months (mean 73 months) after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had a step &gt; or = 2 mm at the origin CEA (2.7% of 261, p = 0.001 when compared with no reoperations for common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in the 659 CEA without a step) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient had &gt; 75% restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven with restenosis were within 2 mm of the original common carotid end point step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Four restenoses were concentric, two eccentric, and one ulcerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Six of the seven arteries were originally reconstructed with a greater saphenous vein patch that extended 3 to 6 mm proximal to the step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative duplex scans of the 27 recent CEA with step reconstruction demonstrated a tortuous but smooth common carotid artery flow channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CEA-produced common carotid artery step is a potential source of both early postoperative emboli and late restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The incidence is approximately 4% in patients with a CEA step &gt; or = 2 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CEA vein patch reconstruction does not prevent restenosis in the region of the step but may lower the incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Although not proven, reconstruction techniques directed at covering the exposed step media and intima and smoothing the flow channel may favorably alter outcome </plain></SENT>
