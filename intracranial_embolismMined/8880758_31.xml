<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It has recently been found that patients receiving cerebral irradiation can develop hemorrhagic dysangiogeneses simulating occult vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To analyze this connection, we report on five patients with occult cerebrovascular malformations occurring after "standard" or focused irradiation performed for <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> in four patients and for a deep-seated cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were within the radiation ports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time interval between irradiation and the detection of the occult vascular malformations varied from 3 to 9 years; the ratio of female to male patients was 4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients were &lt; 15 years old when first irradiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, focal signs) and one was asymptomatic when the lesions were first detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial magnetic resonance imaging scans were available in four patients and a computed tomographic scan in the other patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The initial appearance was that of a hypointense T1-T2 focus; magnetic resonance imaging then revealed focal or multifocal T1 hyperintensity and T2 mixed signal intensity followed by a late ring of decreased signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients were operated on and one was under neuroradiological monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological features of these lesions included clusters of closely packed vascular spaces resembling cavernous malformations sometimes associated with a thrombosed thick-walled vein with intense hemosiderin deposition and fibroblastic proliferation; telangiectasic changes were also seen in the adjacent brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased awareness of occult cerebrovascular malformations is necessary, because their occurrence is not infrequent and they have hemorrhagic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Children receiving cerebral irradiation are at greater risk of this complication </plain></SENT>
