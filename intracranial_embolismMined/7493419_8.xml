<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive aortic compliance measurements have been used previously to assess the distensibility of the aorta in several pathological conditions associated with increased cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We set out to establish whether aortic compliance is abnormal in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulse wave velocity measurements of thoraco-abdominal aortic compliance were made in 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 25 age- and sex-matched hospitalized, non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> control subjects putatively free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since compliance varies with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> changes in blood pressure, a blood pressure corrected index of aortic distensibility, Cp, was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic compliance was significantly reduced in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> control subjects (0.46 +/- 0.27 versus 0.86 +/- 0.34%/10 mmHg, P &lt; 0.0002), corresponding with higher values for pulse wave velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients also had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures (P &lt; 0.02 and P &lt; 0.002 respectively) and total cholesterol levels (P &lt; 0.004) than the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Calculation of Cp did not alter the observation of stiffer aortas in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort (P &lt; 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient and control cohorts, as expected, inverse trends were observed between aortic compliance and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also as expected, in the control group Cp values did not show a relationship with blood pressure (r = 0.02, P = 0.092, not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort a marked dependence of Cp on blood pressure was observed (r = -0.48, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Transoesophageal echocardiographic studies have recently identified advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the ascending aorta as a possible source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and an independent risk factor for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
