<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Embolism is believed to be the major cause of end-organ damage after angioplasty and endoluminal procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, Doppler ultrasound scanning has been used to detect asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined whether asymptomatic embolic signals (ES) could be detected distal to a significant iliac <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> of &gt;60% both before and soon after iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 2-MHz Doppler scan probe was used to monitor for ES in the common femoral artery before and after 10 successful iliac artery <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTAs</z:mp> and at various standardized times in the following 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same protocol was used to study 10 patients in the control group after renal <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a single recording was performed in a second nonoperative control group of 10 patients who had no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Doppler scan signals were recorded on tape for a later blinded analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 24 hours before iliac <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, asymptomatic ES were detected in four of 10 patients during a 1-hour recording but in no controls (P =.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After iliac <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, ES were detected at 30 minutes in nine of 10 iliac subjects but in only one of 10 renal subjects (P =.0003) and at 2 hours in eight of 10 iliac subjects but in only one of 10 renal subjects (P =.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of ES became less frequent, and ES were present at a lower frequency in eight of 10 iliac <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> subjects at 4 hours and in five of 10 at 24 hours but in no renal <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> subjects at these time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ES can be detected in the common femoral artery with Doppler ultrasound scanning in patients with iliac <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> both before and soon after iliac <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> despite preangioplasty aspirin and intra-angioplasty <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occurrences of ES were particularly frequent in the 2 hours after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This technique can be used further to study factors that control plaque stability and to evaluate the effect of therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
