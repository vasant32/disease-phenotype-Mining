<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, however, there have been noted a more uniform distribution of these complications throughout the day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preponderance in the morning of the number of accidents in non-embolic subjects, depends probably on the state of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system during the night, which gives rise to a dilated and hypotonic microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation is, in this way, reduced and the physiological increase in blood pressure during the morning may induce a break through of autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In embolic subjects, on the other hand, an important role may be played by heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> which occur usually during the waking hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In hypertensives, the microcirculatory bed is restricted and cerebro-vascular resistance relatively constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain, paradoxically, is thus better defended against any moderate increase in blood pressure and fluctuations in blood pressure throughout 24 hours, which may leave cerebral autoregulation unchanged, which probably explains the more uniform distribution of cerebro-vascular accidents throughout the 24 hour period </plain></SENT>
