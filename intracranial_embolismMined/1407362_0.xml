<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases of unclippable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated by the endovascular balloon technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine of them involved the anterior circulation, and eight involved the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven of them were treated by parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with detachable balloons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three were treated by endosaccular balloon embolization, and three cases combined with <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> were occluded using <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi> vinyl alcohol <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> (EVAL) including feeding arteries of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Embolic complications occurred in one case of an IC bifurcation giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treated by parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic complications also appeared in two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated by endosaccular balloon embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> propagated into the parent artery and occluded it later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In another case, the displaced balloon had obliterated the parent artery 6 hours after the embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is a safe way to treat internal carotid giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, endosaccular treatment still has some problems, i.e., 1) maintaining the balloon's position to preserve the parent artery, 2) balloon migration into the clot, 3) rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> during or after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our studies indicate that endosaccular balloon embolization is still a high risk procedure and should be used only in selected cases, until new embolic agents, such as detachable coils, become available </plain></SENT>
