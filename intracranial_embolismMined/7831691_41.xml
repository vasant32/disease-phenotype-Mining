<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether atheroma in the ascending aorta and arch is an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 215 consecutive patients with a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and 202 community-based control subjects using transesophageal echocardiography to detect aortic atheroma and potential cardiac sources for embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information about other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors was obtained from a structured interview, and the presence of carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> was assessed by means of duplex ultrasonography or digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine adjusted odds ratios for each risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Atheroma in the ascending aorta and aortic arch was a significant risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, independent of other well-established risk factors including high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for simple atheroma was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 4.2) and for complex atheroma 7.1 (2.7 to 18.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ascending aortic and arch atheroma detected by transesophageal echocardiography is an important new independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further characterization of the embolic potential of atheroma with different echocardiographic appearances and development of optimal management strategies are now needed </plain></SENT>
