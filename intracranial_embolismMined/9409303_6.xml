<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, there is uncertainty whether TM is expressed in brain and what mechanisms govern brain endothelial <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, bovine brain capillaries were used as an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier to determine factors involved in the regulation of TM expression in cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative competitive-polymerase chain reaction assay revealed significant regional differences in the amount of brain capillary TM <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, i.e., cortical &gt; cerebellar &gt; pontine, consistent with the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction findings in which the abundance of TM <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was analyzed relative to beta-actin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional differences in TM <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> brain capillary level correlated well with differences in protein C activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TM <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and activity were not detectable in brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathogenic mediators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, interleukin 1 beta (10 U/mL), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (10 U/mL), produced a time-dependent decrease in brain capillary TM <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (t1/2 of 2.1 and 3.9 hours, respectively) and reduced endothelial TM activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incubation of brain capillaries with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (10 mumol/L) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50095">dibutyryl cAMP</z:chebi> (3 mmol/L) resulted in a 4-fold increase in TM <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> at 4 and 8 hours, respectively, followed by an increase in protein C activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TM at the blood-brain barrier is likely to be an important physiologic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> in brain microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its downregulation by cytokines may contribute to ischemic brain damage and potentially could be counteracted by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> and cAMP </plain></SENT>
