<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy is the most effective prophylaxis against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relatively few studies have examined the use of oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in a large cohort of elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention therapy, we studied elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> admitted to 30 hospitals in northeast Ohio between 1992 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The sample consisted of 12,911 Medicare-insured patients &gt; or =65 years of age who were consecutively admitted with a principal diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> between 1992 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for patients with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bivariate associations between receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and select demographic and clinical variables were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, 2093 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 414 (20%) of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> received oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Older age and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> were significantly negatively associated with receiving oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> was positively associated with receiving oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is common in older patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>; oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention, which has been shown to be effective, is underutilized in this patient population </plain></SENT>
