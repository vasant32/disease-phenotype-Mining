<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They represent so-called VG dural arterio-venous malformations (DAVM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These shunts involve the vasa vasorum normally present in the VG wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physiopathology, clinical signs and age groups are usually the same as those encountered in other DAVMs; conversely they are totally different from the other mural shunts of the VG, detected in the pediatric population (true VG <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>), and leading to different clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous approach in these VG DAVMs is almost always contraindicated unless secondary occlusion of VG afferent has spontaneously excluded the pouch from the cerebral venous circulation </plain></SENT>
