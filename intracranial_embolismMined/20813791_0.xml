<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> is a well-established risk factor for cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, due to the high prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, many of these are bystanders rather than true pathological entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other studies have sought to define which patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> are particularly at risk of cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by measuring various parameters of right atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> length and atrial septal movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: measurements of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> length and atrial septal movement were made prospectively from 72 consecutive patients referred to our centre for <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure following presumed cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, by intracardiac phased array echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant finding from this study was that patients with fewer than 10 mm atrial septal movement had significantly longer <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EVs</z:e> than those in whom there was &gt;10 mm septal movement (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> length with &gt;10 mm septal movement is 6.35 mm, and 13.33 mm with fewer than 10 mm movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of septal movement beyond 10 mm was significantly less in our series than in previously published papers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: we propose that while a large degree of atrial septal movement significantly increases propensity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, its absence does not negate this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We have shown that long <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> may function independently from atrial septal movement to potentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
