<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The authors have incorporated a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49648">holmium</z:chebi>: YAG laser-induced liquid jet (LILJ) within a microcatheter for rapid, safe, and reliable fibrinolysis, and reported its effectiveness in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to evaluate an appropriate operation mode to minimize debris size and to apply the system in in vivo experiments using a porcine cranial artery model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: Evaluation of debris size: The relationships between laser energy and the size of the debris have been evaluated in in vitro experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulsed LILJ (3 Hz for 60 seconds) were applied to the artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> (made out of human blood taken from healthy volunteers) in a <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">teflon</z:chebi> tube (internal diameter: 4 mm) in the following operation modes: firstly, the laser energy was set at 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 W, and urokinase (UK) solution (12000 IU/mL) was supplied at rate of 40 mL/hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 0.8 W operation, the concentrations of UK were changed between 0, 1200, 6000, and 12000 lU/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediately after application of LILJ, the remnant debris were collected and fixed with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi>, and the size and numbers of debris were evaluated under a light microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Application in a porcine cranial artery model: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic models were made using four pigs: the artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were made of porcine blood and 1 mL of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was used to occlude the left lingual artery via a catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After occlusion of lingual artery for 30 minutes, the LILJ microcatheter system was brought to the occlusion site via a guiding catheter and with the assistance of guide-wire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After every 2.5 minutes application of LILJ, angiographies were performed to evaluate the recanalization of the occluded vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cold UK (1200 IU/mL) solution (4 degrees C) was supplied at the rate of 40 mL/hour with laser operation (2 pigs) and without laser operation (2 pigs: control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pigs were decapitated, and vessels at the laser irradiation sites were obtained to evaluate the damage to the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evaluation of debris size: After application of UK solution by the LILJ (12000 lU/mL), 48.7 (1.0 W) to 72.0% (0.8 W) of debris were under 200 microm in size, while 3.7 (0.8 W) to 17.0% (1.2 W) of them exceeded 600 microm, and the 0.8 W operation mode had a tendency to be the better operation mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During the 0.8 W operation mode, 58 (without UK) to 72% (12000 lU/mi) of debris were under 200 microm in size, while 3.5 (12000 lU/mL) to 8.5% (without UK) of them exceeded 600 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Application in a porcine cranial artery model: Recanalization of the occluded vessels was obtained at 15 and 20 minutes in the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Histological specimens showed neither apparent mechanical nor thermal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although an additional system to collect debris, which cannot be dealt with in the pharmacological effect of fibrinolytics in the short-term, should be developed, the present results show the possibility of the LILJ microcatheter system to become a useful assistant device for the mechanical fragmentation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and the enhancement of fibrinolytics </plain></SENT>
