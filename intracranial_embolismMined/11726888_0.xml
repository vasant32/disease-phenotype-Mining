<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas microembolic signals were initially assumed to be of particulate matter, recent studies suggest that they are partially gaseous in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If this is true, alteration of environmental pressure should change microembolic signal counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to evaluate the influence of hyperbaric exposure on microembolic signal counts in persons with prosthetic heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Microembolic signal counts were monitored by transcranial Doppler sonography of both middle cerebral arteries under normobaria (normobaria 1), 2 subsequent periods of hyperbaria (2.5 and 1.75 bar), and a second period of normobaria (normobaria 2) in 15 patients with prosthetic heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each monitoring period lasted 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compression and decompression rates were 0.1 bar/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signal counts increased from 20 (12-78) at normobaria 1 to 79 (30-165) at 2.5 bar (P &lt;.01 vs normobaria 1 and 2), decreased to 44 (18-128) at 1.75 bar (P &lt;.01 vs normobaria 1 and 2.5 bar; P &lt;.001 vs normobaria 2), and returned to 20 (8-96) at normobaria 2 (values are medians and 95% confidence intervals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that gaseous bubbles are underlying material for part of the microembolic signals detected in patients with prosthetic heart valves </plain></SENT>
