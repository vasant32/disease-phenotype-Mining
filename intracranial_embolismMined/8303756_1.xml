<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The capacity of an intravenous infusion of double-stranded tissue-type plasminogen activator to salvage neurological functions in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> was induced by the intracarotid injection of 2-hour-old homologous blood clots to rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological functions were scored on a 5-point scale 48 hours after the injection of the clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infarction size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was examined macroscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intravenous infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (1 or 5 x 10(5) IU/kg) within 3 hours after embolization significantly improved neurological functions (P &lt; .01) and reduced infarction size (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment 6 hours after embolization failed to attenuate the neurological status score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with tissue-type plasminogen activator did not increase the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and was not associated with a systemic fibrinolytic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison with tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment, although urokinase treatment (5 x 10(5) IU/kg) improved neurological functions, it was associated with a systemic fibrinolytic state and a tendency to increase the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings in this model suggest that tissue-type plasminogen activator should be given early after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ischemic symptoms to effectively prevent or limit pathological infarction and improve neurological functions without an increase in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
