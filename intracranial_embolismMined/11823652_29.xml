<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Histopathologic analysis was performed to better understand quantity, particle size, and composition of embolized debris collected in protection filters during carotid artery stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Elective carotid stent implantation with the use of a distal filter protection was attempted in 38 consecutive lesions (36 patients) of the internal carotid artery presenting &gt;70% diameter stenosis (mean, 82.1+/-11.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the patients was 70.7+/-7.7 years; 75% were men, and 50% of patients had previous neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 37 lesions (97.4%) it was possible to position the filter device, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions a stent was successfully implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The only complication occurring in the hospital and during the 30-day follow-up was 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological sequelae did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histomorphometric analysis was performed on the filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presence of debris was detected in 83.7% of filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean surface area of the <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi> membrane filter covered with material was 53.2+/-19.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Particle size ranged from 1.08 to 5043.5 microm (mean, 289.5+/-512 microm) in the major axis and 0.7 to 1175.3 microm (mean, 119.7+/-186.7 microm) in the minor axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collected debris consisted predominantly of thrombotic material, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo>, and cholesterol clefts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By the use of distal protection filters during carotid artery stenting, it was possible to collect particulate debris potentially leading to distal vessel occlusion in a high percentage of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Qualitative analysis of embolized material showed debris dislocated during the percutaneous intervention from atheromatous plaques </plain></SENT>
