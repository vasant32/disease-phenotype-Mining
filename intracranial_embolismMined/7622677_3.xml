<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is a potentially life-threatening entity with a protean clinical presentation that can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography of the brain is often the initial imaging tool in evaluation of these patients, but is frequently nondiagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study identifies subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (SCH) as an indicator of radiographically occult CVT on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects (n = 24) with CVT proven by MRI over a 4 year period was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CT examinations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were evaluated for the presence of SCH and signs of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An evaluation of the correlation between findings on CT and MRI as well as the delay in diagnosis and treatment secondary to unrecognized CVT on CT was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was noted in 9 of 24 (38%) subjects with CVT by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CT antedated MRI in eight of these subjects as the initial evaluation for presenting neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was noted in six of eight of these subjects as the sole CT finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> as well as CVT was seen in one subject, and no abnormality was seen in the final subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was not suggested as a diagnosis in any of the six subjects with SCH as the sole radiographic finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six of these cases, a delay in diagnosis occurred pending MRI obtained subsequently secondary to clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> can be seen in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CVT and can be the sole abnormality on head CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SCH as an isolated finding on CT suggests the possibility of unrecognized CVT, warranting further investigation by MRI </plain></SENT>
