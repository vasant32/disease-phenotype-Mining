<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty of them had torn chordae tendineae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was possible to repair the mitral valve in 57 patients and there were five operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had a femoral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and another had a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of peripheral embolization was 4 per cent compared with 40 per cent reported for ball valve replacement.Forty-eight of the 57 patients with repair (84 per cent) were living and well with at most a grade II/VI apical systolic murmur up to seven and a half years after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There has been no evidence of recurrence in these patients.In approximately 90 per cent of patients with pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo>, repair should be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When feasible, repair is more satisfactory than valvular replacement, with not only excellent long-term results, but far less morbidity than is reported with ball valve replacement </plain></SENT>
