<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, cerebral ischemic microlesions have been identified with diffusion-weighted magnet resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The clinical course and longer-term characteristics of these lesions are not known and were investigated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 86 patients, 33 (38%) had new asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> documented on MRI after catheter ablation for AF; 14 of these 33 (42%) underwent repeat MRI at different time intervals (2 weeks to 1 year) during follow-up, and clinical symptoms as well as size and number of residual lesions were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In postablation cerebral MRI, 50 new lesions were identified (3.6 lesions/patient) in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient presented any neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distribution of the lesions was predominantly in the left hemisphere (60%) and the cerebellum (26%); 52% of the lesions were small (≤3 mm maximum diameter), 42% were medium (4 to 10 mm) and 3 lesions (6%) had a maximum diameter &gt;10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI after a median of 3 months revealed 3 residual lesions in 3 of 14 patients corresponding to the large <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postablation lesions (&gt;10 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 47 of 50 (94%) of the small or medium-sized lesions were not detectable at follow-up evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> observed acutely after AF ablation procedures were ≤10 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>94% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions healed without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> at follow-up &gt;2 weeks after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesions produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> glial scars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesions were associated with neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
