<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As embolic complications can occur during carotid angioplasty and stenting, a device was developed to protect from cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 1999 and May 2002, carotid angioplasty and stenting was performed in 100 patients (84 men; mean age, 69.2 years) with symptomatic (26%) or asymptomatic (74%) severe carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wallstents were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with selective pre-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protection devices (Parodi Anti-Emboli System [PAES], ArteriA, San Francisco, Calif) were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated by a neurologist, both before and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the criteria set forth by the large trials, the occurrence of minor, major or fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (end points) within 30 days and follow-up were determined as end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data were collected prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 3% (1 noncorresponding minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1 hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 1 cardiac event) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed postoperative transient neurologic events (three related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> and the fourth due to postoperative embolization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall technical success rate for carotid angioplasty (protection device placed in position percutaneously) was 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety of carotid angioplasty and stenting with PAES are confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This innovative protection device may prevent the debris released by angioplasty from entering the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is warranted </plain></SENT>
