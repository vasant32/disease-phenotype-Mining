<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The older patients (248) suffered from the same <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity as the younger patients (367) experienced, however, a more severy clinical course (placebo group after 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: Barthel Index 50 vs. 85, mortality 24% vs. 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with rt-PA increased the proportion of undisabled patients at 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> significantly only in the younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk for brain parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was increased by the factor of 4.7 and 4.6 in both age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is obviously harder to achieve an undisabled state by systemic thrombolysis in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Facing the risk of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> associated with rt-PA, the risk-benefit-ratio may be less favourable in patients over 70 years </plain></SENT>
