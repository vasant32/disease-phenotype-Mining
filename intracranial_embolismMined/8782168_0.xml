<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the records of 110 patients with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE) who were hospitalized between 1977 and 1994 at a tertiary referral center in Southern India to assess the occurrence of neurologic complications and the factors that contribute to their development, and to compare our experience from a developing country with the reported data from developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 62 males and 48 females, aged 0.6-59 (mean 24.0) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">Rheumatic heart disease</z:e> (RHD) was the most frequent underlying cardiac lesion accounting for 65 (59.1%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications were observed in 58 (52.7%) patients: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was the most frequent (23 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five (31.8%) patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality in the group with neurologic complications (41.4%) was significantly higher than in the group without (21.2%) (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis was longer in the group with neurologic complications, mean 174.9 versus 95.6 days (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) IE occurs at younger ages in the Third World and RHD still constitute the major underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>; (2) in spite of the differences in the general aspects of IE between developed and developing nations, the frequency and gravity of neurologic complications are similar, (3) mortality is significantly increased in patients with neurologic complications; and (4) delay in the diagnosis of IE contributes to the development of neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
