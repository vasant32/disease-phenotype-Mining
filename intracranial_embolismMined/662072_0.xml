<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To obtain more reliability of this method, techniques of electroencephalography induced from depth electrode to the thalamus were applied in this experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following a temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, a significant diminution of fast wave component of about 10 Hz occurred with attenuation of voltage in the ipsilateral thalamic depth electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cases of 2 hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> done by this method, an obvious infarction in the thalamus was confirmed histologically 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors emphasised that when the experimental model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> in the dog are combined with EEG, not only can <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> be producted with more certainly but also the EEG changes can be followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This analysis is important since it provides information on the chronological changes in the ischemic region or infarction lesion </plain></SENT>
