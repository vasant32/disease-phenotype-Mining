<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 48 days, the Enovid-treated animals developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> characterized by massive thrombonecrogenic lesions of the parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blood pressure of the Enovid-treated SP/SHR rose most acutely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The low protein fish diet was markedly catabolic and caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, elevated ACTH and beta-endorphin levels concomitant with reduced gonadotrophic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Enovid caused severe exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the foregoing changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that a low protein fish diet + 1% saline will accelerate the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in SP/SHR and that Enovid will enhance this effect through its anti-gonadotrophic activity and ability to stimulate increased pituitary-adrenal secretion </plain></SENT>
