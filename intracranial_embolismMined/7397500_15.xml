<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The injected dye is avidly taken up by the brain cells and is distributed mainly in intracellular organelles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratio of optical signals recorded from the frozen brain at 445 and 530 nm and compared with calibration curves provides pH values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Color transition of neutral red ranges from 6.0 to 8.0 pH units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Topographic application of this method is particularly useful in studying local pH changes in brains with developing ischemic foci </plain></SENT>
