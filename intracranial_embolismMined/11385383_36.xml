<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence of cerebral perfusion and embolization during cardiopulmonary bypass on cognitive function and recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebrovascular reactivity was measured in 70 patients before coronary operations in which nonpulsatile bypass was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Throughout the operations, middle cerebral artery flow velocity and embolization were recorded by transcranial Doppler and regional oxygen saturation was recorded by near-infrared spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was measured by a computerized battery of tests before the operation and 1 week, 2 months, and 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients undergoing urologic surgery served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebrovascular reactivity was impaired preoperatively in 49 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median (interquartile range) regional cerebral oxygen saturation fell during bypass by 10% (6%-15%), indicating increased oxygen extraction, whereas mean middle cerebral flow velocity increased significantly by a median of 6 cm/s (both P &lt;.0001, Wilcoxon), suggesting increased arterial tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More than 200 emboli were detected in 40 patients, mainly on aortic clamping and release, when bypass was initiated, and during defibrillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function deteriorated more in patients having cardiopulmonary bypass than in control patients having urologic operations but recovered in most tests by 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Measures of cerebral perfusion (poor cerebrovascular reactivity, low arterial pressures, and flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery) predicted poor attention at 1 week (r = 0.3, P &lt;.01, Spearman) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Emboli were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> (r = 0.3, P &lt;.02, Spearman) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive deficits</z:hpo> were common after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Occult cerebrovascular disease was more severe than expected and predisposed to attention difficulties, whereas emboli caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We believe this to be the first report of differing cognitive effects from emboli and hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
