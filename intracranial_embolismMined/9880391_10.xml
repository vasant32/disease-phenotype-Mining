<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the diagnostic value of both noncontrast and contrast-enhanced TCCS by comparing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 75 healthy volunteers (aged 45.8+/-17.4 years), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values for the deep cerebral veins (DCVs) and the posterior fossa sinuses were established by transtemporal insonation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were assessed by TCCS, through which the hemodynamics of the DCVs were measured, and the patients were followed-up over a period of between 33 and 387 days after examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography served as the "gold standard" technique for confirming the venous status in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No side differences in flow velocities were detected in the paired venous structures in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As indirect signs of (and diagnostic criteria for) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, pathologically increased flow velocities or significant side differences in the DCVs were registered in 5 of the 8 patients; the other patients showed nonsignificant increases in flow velocity which decreased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, the status of the posterior fossa sinuses could be diagnosed correctly in seven patients after contrast enhancement when these results were compared with those of venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, a partial recanalization was mistakenly diagnosed as an occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCCS allows a reliable evaluation of the major DCVs and posterior fossa sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The anterior and mid portions of the superior sagittal sinus and cortical veins cannot be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased venous blood flow velocity can be used as an indirect criterion for indicating a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical recovery coincided with decreases in blood flow velocity in the series of patients investigated in this study </plain></SENT>
