<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>Myxomas</z:mp> were classified into two types based on macroscopical findings, and clinical characteristics of these two types were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven cases (64%) classified as "lobular-type <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp>" were seen as lobulated, gelatinous and fragile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four cases (36%) were classified as "round-type <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp>" were round and elastic soft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> on exertion in five cases (45%) and neurological disturbances in six cases (55%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These eleven <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> successfully removed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of these <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp>, which were pedunculated with fine fibrous stalks, were shaved along the base at the atrial septum or free wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Others were excised completely along with a portion of the adjacent septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination of the operative specimens revealed that two lobular-type <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> with broad-based attachment to left atrial septum had invaded the atrial septum </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In two cases with round-type <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp>, neovascularity was evident and was made up of clusters of tortuous vessels with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> blush.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
