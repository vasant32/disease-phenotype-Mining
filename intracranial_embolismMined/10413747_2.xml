<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>Embolus</z:mpath> detection by transcranial Doppler ultrasound is very time consuming and semi-automated detection is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The device studied, a TC4040, Nicolet-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e>, uses the four-gate technique and allows for audiovisual off-line verification of the recorded events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty controls, 10 patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves and 12 patients with occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> were investigated by transcranial colour-coded duplex sonography and, subsequently, underwent a 1-h unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection from the middle cerebral artery using four-gate TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the Doppler spectrum background, microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) and artefacts produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A detection threshold of 5 dB or more was defined taking into account natural fluctuations of the Doppler spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sensitivity of the software was 91.9% and observer-software agreement on <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was 7.8% in the valve patients, and 77.7% and 7.5% in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Weaker <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were more likely not to be detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The artefact signal rejection rate was 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> produced either positive or zero time delays in adjacent channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Artefact signals produced either no delay, or a positive or a negative time delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Duration of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> ranged from 1-88 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Besides refined recognition of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> using the time delay, four gates give faint <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> no less than four opportunities to overcome the detection threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With this device's satisfying sensitivity, regions of interest in a 1-h recording can audiovisually be evaluated off-line in a few minutes by an investigator </plain></SENT>
