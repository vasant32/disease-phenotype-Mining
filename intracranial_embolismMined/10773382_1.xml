<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monitoring was performed over the middle cerebral artery (55 mm) and the brain parenchyma (29 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intensity changes were expressed as percent of change compared to the value measured in the proximal depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cut-off value providing the highest sensitivity and specificity in the differentiation was evaluated using 250 MES and 250 artefact signals, and subsequently analysed in the first part of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intensity values derived from the distal depth were subsequently evaluated in 10 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 45 patients with potential arterial or cardioembolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intensity changes of 87% (84%-90%) and -58% (-71%-(-48%)) were measured in the initial 500 signals for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and artefact signals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best intensity cut-off value was calculated at 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This value was subsequently applied to a total of 1858 MES and 1958 artefacts, resulting to sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 98%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proposed technique provided adequate results, warranting further evaluation </plain></SENT>
