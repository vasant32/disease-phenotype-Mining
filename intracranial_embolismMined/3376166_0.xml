<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resulting <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was produced in the middle or rostral cerebral artery within 5-15 minutes after delivery of the thrombogenic device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The correlation of location of the coil in the intracranial vasculature of the internal carotid artery with the anatomic distribution of resulting cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> suggests that this experimental model can produce a selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> local occlusion of cerebral vessels in a high proportion of dogs without violating the cranium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The composition of the autologous thromboembolus, the low mortality rate, and the excellent reproducibility will make the correlative study of thrombolytic agents and their therapeutic efficacy possible </plain></SENT>
