<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A transient increase in blood pressure (BP) occurs immediately after experimental embolization in rabbits and we evaluated the relationship between this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hypertensive response and subsequent hemorrhagic transformation, as well as the attenuation of this hypertensive response with an <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also examined embolism-induced HT during infusion of the thrombolytic agents tissue plasminogen activator and streptokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A blood clot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was injected into the internal carotid artery and flushed into the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, BP was monitored in anesthetized or unanesthetized rabbits for 20 min prior to and up to 1 h after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, animals were embolized half-way through an infusion of tPA (3.0 mg/kg; 20% administered as an iv bolus, with the remainder infused over 30 min) or streptokinase (30,000 U/kg iv infused over 30 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In unanesthetized animals, the HT score (number of brain sections displaying visible HT) was significantly correlated with the peak mean arterial pressure recorded at embolization (r = 0.60, n = 24, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relationship was observed between BP and HT score in animals anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although HT incidence and extent were significantly related to elevated BP in the unanesthetized animals, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> administration actually increased HT incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Embolization during thrombolytic infusion did not increase the occurrence or severity of HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, but not ongoing thrombolysis, is a significant risk factor for HT following cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
