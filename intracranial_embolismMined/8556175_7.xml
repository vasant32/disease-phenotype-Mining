<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete success of therapy was achieved in 68.4% of patients, and the results were better in patients with aortic compared to mitral valve prostheses (p &lt; 0.01), in those presenting in lower NYHA class (p &lt; 0.01), and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> symptoms (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A successful outcome was seen more frequently with tilting disc than bileaflet valves (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality during therapy was 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral embolic events were observed in 9.5% of patients, and irreversible neurological injury occurred in 4.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rethrombosis rate was 17% and the incidence of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 6.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis may be a useful therapeutic alternative for left sided prosthetic valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with a perceived contraindication to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risks of systemic clot embolization along with incomplete resolution of valve leaflet motion or rethrombosis limits any recommendation for more widespread use </plain></SENT>
