<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: It is known from autopsy studies that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> can be caused by red, white and mixed clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined whether the efficacy of thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) depends on the proportions of fibrin and erythrocytes within thromboembolic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 23 rabbits intraarterial thrombolysis with 3 mg rt-PA/kg body weight was started 30 minutes after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with either red or white autologous emboli 20 hours old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>20 rabbits served as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion was monitored by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: rt-PA enhanced lysis of red but not of white emboli and decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume only if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> was due to red emboli (p &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion improved only in the red treatment group where the normalized first moment (NFM) decreased (p &lt;.05) and the relative regional cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) reached <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values (p &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that in our animal model the efficacy of thrombolysis increases with the proportion of erythrocytes within thromboembolic material and decreases with its content of fibrin. lf these findings would also be applicable to patients, pretherapeutic estimation of the efficacy of thrombolysis might become feasible because the CT values of red and white <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> differ </plain></SENT>
