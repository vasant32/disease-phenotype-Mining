<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven consecutive patients, age 50 and younger, had clinical evidence of cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of physical, radiographic, electrocardiographic, and two-dimensional echocardiographic examinations were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> respiration, eight of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> at the atrial level shown by microcavitation contrast two-dimensional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of the eight patients with positive contrast studies had cardiac catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of six patients had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> right and left heart pressures, and small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> during a Valsalva strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had surgical closure of the defect, which ranged in size from 5 to 10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interatrial communications appear to be common in young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, suggesting paradoxical embolization as a possible mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Contrast two-dimensional echocardiography should be done in such patients because it is the only noninvasive technique that reliably finds these defects </plain></SENT>
