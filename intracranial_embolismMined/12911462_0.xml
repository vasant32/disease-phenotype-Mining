<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-two rats were embolized unilaterally and assigned to: (i). controls, (ii) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rt-PA 6 mg/kg, (iii) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PENTA 0.5 mg/kg, (iv) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PENTA 0.5 mg/kg and rt-PA 6 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 days animals were killed, the brains removed and evaluated microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size measured in percentage of the affected hemisphere was 25% in the control group, 4% (P &lt; 0.01, Mann Whitney) in group 2, 19% (n.s.) in group 3, and 10% (P &lt; 0.05) in group 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rt-PA, and rt-PA combined with PENTA also promoted functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study found no effect of 0.5 mg/kg PENTA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with rt-PA treatment alone, 0.5 mg/kg PENTA alone or combined with rt-PA did not significantly increase mortality or tendency for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
