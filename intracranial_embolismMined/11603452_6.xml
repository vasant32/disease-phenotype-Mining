<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a bridging mechanism for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> to remain viable until heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> has been reported as high as 47% in some studies but the rate of other neurologic complications in patients with LVADs is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had LVADs implanted at our hospital from September 1993 until September 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complications from the time of implantation until heart transplantation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and functional outcome were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three patients had LVADs placed in the four-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 23 patients, 9 had neurologic complications after placement of the LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These included four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> died from multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> received a transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> died from multiorgan failure and another received a transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most devastating medical complication was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, which occurred in 7 patients and was associated with 100% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surviving patients with neurologic complications went on to transplant and good functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic complications are common in patients with LVADs, occurring in 9 out of 23 patients in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> are a poor prognostic indicator and were associated with 100% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> did not have a negative impact on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> had a mixed outcome, which reflects the multifactorial nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further study needs to be done to limit the neurologic complications associated with LVADs and further improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
