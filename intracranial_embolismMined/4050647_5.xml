<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore we looked at 2DE and clinical variables that included texture features in the 2DE of 38 patients whose 2DE had LV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and questioned these patients to see if clinical embolization had occurred in the 8.9 +/- 6.1 month (+/- SD) average follow-up period </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variables considered were the age of the patient, the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> present, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> administration, exercise tolerance, standard M-mode measurements, LV dyssynergy by 2DE, clot size and mobility, and gray scale statistics which include run length, Sobel edge points followed by 50% gradient thresholding, gray level second-order statistics, offset 1 and gray level difference statistics, offset 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The values of the variables were then entered into an expert system (Expert Ease) in order to achieve classification of patients into emboli versus no emboli groups, while using a minimal number of variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only variables that were needed included run length, long runs emphasis, gray level difference statistics (entropy, contrast, mean, and angular second moment), gray level second-order statistics (contrast), and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
