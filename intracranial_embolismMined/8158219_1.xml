<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) remain undetermined for each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed the present study to clarify this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 77 unilateral, hemispheric, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who had a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> episode; atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 34, cardioembolic in 26 and lacunar in 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured baseline CBF in the affected and unaffected hemispheres 1.0-3.4 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, then repeated the measurements 10 months to 10 years later (mean 43.7 months), with the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 inhalation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed changes in CBF in relation to other clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF in the affected hemisphere changed differently among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes (P &lt; 0.01); increased in the atherothrombotic group, particularly within 40 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; remained unchanged in the cardioembolic group; and decreased in the lacunar group, especially later than 40 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the atherothrombotic group, CBF increased in hypertensive patients but decreased in normotensives (7.9 +/- 2.4% and -3.6 +/- 3.9%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Present results suggest that long-term changes in CBF depend on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Development of collateral circulation may occur after several years in atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings raise doubts about the significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodynamic failure as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
