<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the technical details and validation of an improved rat model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> and rt-PA induced reperfusion, which closely resembles clinical embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was proximally occluded by injection of twelve medium sized (1.5 x 0.35 mm), fibrin-rich autologous blood clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On inspection, densely packed clot material was found at the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> origin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autoradiographic rCBF measurements showed severe ischemic deficit throughout the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volume in which flow values fell below 30 ml/100 g per min was 54 +/- 14% of the hemispheric volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rt-PA treated animals the proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was recanalised, and the volume with flow values below 30 ml/100 g per min was reduced to 29 +/- 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological findings paralleled the spatial spread of the CBF deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rat model presented is well-suited for investigations of the specific pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore it allows detailed studies of thrombolytically induced reperfusion, beyond the question of successful recanalisation </plain></SENT>
