<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is essential to measure the skin dose of radiation received by patients during interventional neuroradiologic procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance, such as embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo>, which is regarded as a high-dose interventional radiology procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report a method for evaluating maximum skin dose (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>), an ideal marker of radiation-induced effects, based on an innovative use of radiochromic films </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight procedures were studied in 42 patients undergoing embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopic and digital dose-area product (DAP), fluoroscopy time, and total number of acquired images were recorded for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> was measured using Gafchromic XR type R films </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> was measured in one group of 21 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The coefficient (kappa) of the interpolation line between the skin dose and the DAP (kappa = 0.0029 cm(-2)) was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An approximate value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> from the DAP for the remaining 27 procedures was estimated by means of an interpolation line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> was found to be 1.16 Gy (range, 0.23-3.20 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of radiochromic XR type R films was shown to be an effective method for measuring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These films have the advantage of supplying information on both the maximum dose and the distribution of the dose: this satisfies the most stringent interpretation of Food and Drug Administration, American College of Radiology, and international recommendations for recording skin dose </plain></SENT>
