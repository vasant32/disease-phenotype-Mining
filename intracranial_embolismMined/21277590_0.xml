<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Higher mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass may improve cerebral outcome associated with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> by increasing emboli clearance and collateral flow to salvage the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this may come at the expense of increased delivery of embolic load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the influence of mean arterial pressures on cerebral functional and histologic outcome after cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> during cardiopulmonary bypass in an established rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 90 minutes of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with 10 cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolisms</z:mpath> (0.3 μL/bolus) injected repetitively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomized to 3 groups (n = 10, each) that differed in mean arterial pressure management during cardiopulmonary bypass: 50 mm Hg (low mean arterial pressure), 60 to 70 mm Hg (standard mean arterial pressure), and 80 mm Hg (high mean arterial pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic score was assessed on postoperative days 3 and 7 when cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was determined with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test beginning on postoperative day 3 and continuing to postoperative day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurologic score was better in high and standard mean arterial pressure groups versus low mean arterial pressure groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High mean arterial pressure resulted in shorter water maze latencies compared with standard and low mean arterial pressure on postoperative days 6 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas were not different among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of higher mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass in a rat model of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> conveyed beneficial effects on functional cerebral outcome with no apparent disadvantage of increased delivery of embolic load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Maintaining higher perfusion pressures in situations of increased cerebral embolic load may be considered as a collateral therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
