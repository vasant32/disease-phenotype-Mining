<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Identification of specific features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in minority populations should lead to more effectively focused treatment and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 1290 white (WHI), 242 Hispanic (HIS), 83 Native American (NA), and 101 other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) patients hospitalized at the Barrow Neurological Institute from 1990 through 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chi-square analysis detected significant (P&lt;.05) differences as follows: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> types--lacunes more prevalent in NA than WHI and HIS (30% versus 16% and 15%); cardioembolic more prevalent in WHI than HIS (16% versus 9%, NA 14%); <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> more prevalent in HIS than WHI and NA (48% versus 37% and 27%); (2) Risk factors--<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> more prevalent in HIS than WHI (72% versus 66%; NA 71%); <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> more prevalent in NA than HIS and WHI (62% versus 36% and 17%); cigarette smoking more prevalent in WHI than HIS and NA (61% versus 46% and 41%); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> more prevalent in WHI than HIS (34% versus 24%; NA 27%); heavier alcohol intake in NA than HIS than WHI (43% versus 24% versus 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant outcome differences between races for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ANOVA detected significantly lower mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in NA than HIS than WHI (56 versus 61 versus 69 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in prevalence of risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types between WHI, HIS, and NA in our hospital-based population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the three races appear to respond to risk factors similarly, Hispanics may be especially susceptible to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of these observations in community-based studies will be important </plain></SENT>
