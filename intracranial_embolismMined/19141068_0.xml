<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to study the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with large artery occlusive diseases treated with low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) or aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients participating in the Fraxiparine in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic Stroke</z:hpo> (FISS)-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">tris</z:chebi> study were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection was performed from middle cerebral artery on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days after randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and the treatment was determined by the chi(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 47 patients, 26 were randomized to LMWH and 21 to aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On day 1, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 10 patients (7/26 on LMWH, 3/21 on aspirin; P= .475) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 3, 12 patients had <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (7/25 on LMWH, 5/20 on aspirin; P= .821) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 7, 11 patients had <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (6/25 on LMWH, 5/20 on aspirin; P= .938) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median of the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> on days 1, 3, and 7 was 4 (range 1-10), 5 (range 1-42), and 3 (range 1-33) for the LMWH group and 1 (range 1-15), 4 (range 1-10), and 2 (range 1-4) for the aspirin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> between patients with large artery occlusive disease treated with LMWH and aspirin </plain></SENT>
