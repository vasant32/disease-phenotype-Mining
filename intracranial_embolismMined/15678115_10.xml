<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, combination treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) and 7E3 F(ab')2, a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor that binds the platelet to fibrin, may improve the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to monitor treatment response in rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomized into treated (n=12) and control (n=10) groups and received intravenous combination therapy or saline, respectively, 4 hours after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements performed 1 hour after MCAo showed no difference between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, an increased incidence (50%) of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization was found in the treated group at 24 hours compared with 20% in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area of low cerebral blood flow at 24 and 48 hours was significantly smaller in the combination treatment group, and the lesion size, as indicated from the T2 and T1 maps, differed significantly between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence microscopy measurements of cerebral microvessels perfused with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and measurements of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume revealed that the combination treatment significantly increased microvascular patency and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, respectively, compared with the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of combination treatment 4 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is reflected by MRI indices of tissue perfusion, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization, and reduction of lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment also reduced secondary microvascular perfusion deficits </plain></SENT>
