<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The top hat supraannular prosthesis, a standard bileaflet valve with the cuff transferred to the valve inflow level, allowed implantation of 21-mm, 23-mm, and 25-mm valves, where a standard 19-mm or 21-mm valve would have usually been placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient who had been in preoperative cardiogenic shock died in the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another had an intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with permanent impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up on 22 of 23 patients over a mean period of 9 months revealed mean Doppler gradients of 18 +/- 6 mmHg, 15 +/- 2.8 mmHg, and 11 mmHg, for the 21-mm, 23-mm, and 25-mm valves, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional improvement was noted, with 17 patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I and 6 in NYHA Class II, postoperatively, compared with 0 in Class I, 9 in Class II, 10 in Class III, and 4 in Class IV, preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient showed reduced postoperative ventricular function with fractional shortening below 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pandiastolic regurgitation intrinsic to the valve graded as slight was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other postoperative complications included one patient with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> and one other with prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> successfully treated with antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CarboMedics top hat valve allows a gain in prosthesis size of 2 mm to 4 mm in the aortic position over standard prostheses, resulting in favorable postoperative hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
