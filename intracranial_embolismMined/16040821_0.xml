<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Paradoxical embolization by cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> (RLS) is increasingly recognized as an important factor for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler sonography (ce-TCDS) is an established diagnostic tool for RLS detection but is frequently limited because of an inadequate temporal acoustic bone window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether extracranial sonography (ECS) using harmonic frequencies improves detection of RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Extracranial color duplex sonography using harmonic frequencies enables visualization of even single ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles because of oscillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and positive RLS findings on transesophageal echocardiography underwent a simultaneous extracranial and transcranial sonographic examination of the proximal common carotid artery (CCA) and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) on the same side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Valsalva strain was performed for 10 seconds after intravenous bolus injection of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-based nontranspulmonary contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The B-mode frame sequences of the transverse plane of the CCA obtained by harmonic ECS and the ce-TCDS recordings of high-intensity transient signals from the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were analyzed offline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with RLS, the shunts could be identified by harmonic ECS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A close correlation could be seen between the count of visualized microbubbles in the CCA and the number of high-intensity transient signals detected on ce-TCDS in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that contrast-enhanced ultrasound harmonic imaging of the CCA using a Valsalva strain might be an optional screening tool for detection of cardiac RLS in patients with insufficient acoustic bone windows </plain></SENT>
