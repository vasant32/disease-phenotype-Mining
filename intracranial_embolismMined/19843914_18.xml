<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: TRENDS was a prospective, observational study enrolling patients with &gt; or = 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, age &gt; or = 65 years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or prior TE) receiving pacemakers or defibrillators that monitor atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT)/AF burden (defined as the longest total AT/AF duration on any given day during the prior 30-day period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This time-varying exposure was updated daily during follow-up and related to TE risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Annualized TE rates were determined according to AT/AF burden subsets: zero, low (&lt;5.5 hours [median duration of subsets with nonzero burden]), and high (&gt; or = 5.5 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multivariate Cox model provided hazard ratios including terms for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors and time-varying AT/AF burden and antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients (n=2486) had at least 30 days of device data for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 1.4 years, annualized TE risk (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>) was 1.1% for zero, 1.1% for low, and 2.4% for high burden subsets of 30-day windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with zero burden, adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) in the low and high burden subsets were 0.98 (0.34 to 2.82, P=0.97) and 2.20 (0.96 to 5.05, P=0.06), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The TE rate was low compared with patients with traditional AF with similar risk profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that TE risk is a quantitative function of AT/AF burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AT/AF burden &gt; or = 5.5 hours on any of 30 prior days appeared to double TE risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to more precisely investigate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk and AT/AF burden </plain></SENT>
