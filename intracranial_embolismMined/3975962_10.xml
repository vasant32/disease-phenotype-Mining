<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have observed the details of these in vivo vascular changes under the electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracytoplasmic vacuole (1.0-2.0 micron in diameter) formation and partial deendothelialization followed by platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation were characteristic changes in the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These vacuoles did not contain horseradish peroxidase (HRP) which was used as a marker of vascular permeability change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with these phenomenon, increased vesicular (0.05-0.2 micron in diameter) transport was prominent, and vacuole formation was rarely seen in small vessels, namely, capillaries and arterioles in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cell damage seemed to be more prominent in large arteries, but only the smaller vessels show marked extravasation of HRP-reaction product and perivascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> and 6-keto <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> were significantly increased 3 min after the <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> injection and returned to pre-injection levels at 60 min after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that vasoactive substances resulting from platelet activation may play an important role in producing cerebrovascular injuries caused by platelet aggregation induced with <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
