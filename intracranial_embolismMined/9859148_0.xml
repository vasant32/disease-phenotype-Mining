<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the complications and ischemic relapses in patients treated with AO for secondary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> of cardiac embolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 169 patients with embologenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> who, following an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, were treated with AO and followed-up at our medical centre for at least three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recorded their past clinical history and risk factors, occurrence of vascular relapses (VR), complications involving <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (CH), and data regarding course and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 50.3 months of a total of 707.9 patient/years, 20 VR (2.8% per year) were recorded; 15 of these were cerebro-vascular and mainly mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recorded 59 CH in 41 patients (8.3% per year) of which 6 were considered to be major </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a 30% drop-out rate from follow-up at our centre, mainly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from other causes or to change of referral centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a low incidence of relapse and of complications (usually mild) following AO for the secondary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> of cardio-embolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Efficacy and security are maintained in the long term </plain></SENT>
