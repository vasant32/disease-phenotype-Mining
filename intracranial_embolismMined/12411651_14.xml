<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to describe the clinical outcome and results obtained in the endovascular therapy of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> in the elderly over an 8-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared endovascular therapy results in patients aged &gt; or =65 and &lt;65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 1993-1999, 52 patients aged 65 to 85 years (mean age, 71.5+/-4.7 years) were embolized with the use of Guglielmi detachable coils (group I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the same period, 143 patients aged &lt;65 years (mean age, 47+/-11 years) with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> were treated with the same technique (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clinical assessment was made on admission with the Hunt and Hess (HH) classification and again in the 12th month with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), with arteriographic control in months 3 and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group I, clinical grades on admission were as follows: HH 1, 9.5%; HH 2, 33%; HH 3, 21%; HH 4, 34.5%; HH 5, 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was favorable in 48% of patients (GOS 1 or 2); the mortality rate was 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No rebleeding was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting lesions &gt; or =10 mm had an unfavorable outcome in &gt;77% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic complications were present in 13% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group II, clinical grades on admission were as follows: HH 1, 14.5%; HH 2, 47%; HH 3, 11%; HH 4, 24%; HH 5, 3.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome (GOS 1 or 2) was observed in 77% of cases, with 14% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complications due to the endovascular procedure were present in 4.2% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with HH grades 1 or 2 on admission showed a positive outcome (GOS 1 or 2) in 77% of cases in group I and in 88.5% of cases in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 9% in the first subgroup compared with 2.8% in the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients who had a high clinical grade on admission (HH 4 or 5) showed a favorable outcome (GOS 1 or 2) in 16% of cases in group I compared with 41% in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients aged &gt; or =65 years appears to be effective against rebleeding and represents an alternative to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, perioperative thromboembolic complications are more frequent in the elderly population </plain></SENT>
