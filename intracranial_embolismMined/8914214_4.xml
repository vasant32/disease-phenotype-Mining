<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated, prospectively, the prevalence and severity of AAA in patients with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to ascertain its role as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 100 consecutive patients who had experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptoms due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination, electrocardiogram, x-ray, ultrasound examination of craniocervical arteries, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cranial computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five patients showed evidence of AAA; 34 patients had moderate to severe (&gt; 5 mm thickening) AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age was positively related to the severity of AAA, as were smoking, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusive disease, and embologenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, which was evident in 52 patients, did not distinguish those cases showing AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients showed evidence of high-degree ICA stenosis on the symptomatic side, although the extent of ICA stenosis and AAA were unrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A cardiac source of emboli was found in 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AAA was found to be the probable source for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is an important source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> which may increase the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we suggest that TEE examination of the aortic arch may be important for the diagnosis of AAA and ultimately for the prophylactic treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
