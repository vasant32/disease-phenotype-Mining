<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven European, 5 Japanese, and 5 other centers participated the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as such (regardless of its type) seems to have been established accurately in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 3 groups of centers; this leads to the conclusion that the incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as registered in the participating centers were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of the types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was less reliable, since intra-and inter-observer bias was found in the diagnosis of the identical sample of test cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some European centers, the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was rarely determined, unless objective and definitive evidences were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Japanese centers appeared to have diagnosed the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a relatively more uniform way between centers, however, the consistency of the diagnosis at separate times was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, when diagnosed, was generally based on firmer gounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations were confirmed in a small number of autopsy-verified cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These varying diagnostic attitudes introduce false differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such "softness" of type-diagnosis must be borne in mind when comparison of type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at different times or between populations is attempted </plain></SENT>
