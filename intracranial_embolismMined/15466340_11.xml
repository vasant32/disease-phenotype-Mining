<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of mechanical disruption of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in the carotid artery distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed clinical and radiologic findings and functional outcomes 3 months after thrombolysis with mechanical disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were classified as good for modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores of 0-2, moderate for mRS scores of 3, and poor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and mRS scores of 4 or 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three consecutive patients with severe hemispheric symptoms were treated with several methods of mechanical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> disruption during the intra-arterial administration of urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had occlusions of the proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), and 11 had occlusions of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions and in 10 (91%) with ICA occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were good in nine patients (75%) with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions and in four (36.4%) with ICA occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early management of vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, caused by a microguidewire tip in two patients, resulted in early hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither patient had a major deficit attributable to the complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high incidence of recanalization and clinical improvement can be observed in patients with occlusions of not only the proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> but also the distal ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This method might be an effective additional option to intra-arterial thrombolysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> distal ICA and proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions </plain></SENT>
