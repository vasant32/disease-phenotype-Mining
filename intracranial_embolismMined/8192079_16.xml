<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> patterns of venous sinus occlusive disease and to relate them to the underlying pathophysiology by comparing the appearance and pathophysiologic features of venous sinus occlusive disease with those of arterial ischemic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examinations of 26 patients with venous sinus occlusive disease were retrospectively reviewed with special attention to mass effect, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and T2-weighted image abnormalities as well as to abnormal parenchymal, venous, or arterial enhancement after intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">gadopentetate dimeglumine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies when available were evaluated for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, infarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mass effect, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mass effect was present in 25 of 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 26 had mass effect without abnormal signal on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had abnormal signal on T2-weighted images, but this was much less extensive than the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient showed abnormal parenchymal or arterial enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormal venous enhancement was seen in 10 of 13 patients who had contrast-enhanced studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was seen in nine patients with high signal on T2-weighted images predominantly peripheral to the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> patterns were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>: 1) mass effect without associated abnormal signal on T2-weighted images, 2) mass effect with associated abnormal signal on T2-weighted images and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> that may be reversible, and 3) intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> with surrounding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings of venous sinus occlusive disease are different from those of arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and may reflect different underlying pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In venous sinus occlusive disease, the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and abnormal parenchymal enhancement) does not always occur, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> can persist up to 2 years with or without abnormal signal on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormal signal on T2-weighted images may be reversible and does not always indicate infarction </plain></SENT>
