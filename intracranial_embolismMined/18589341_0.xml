<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Recent articles have promoted anticoagulation for potential sources of embolism detected on echocardiography, despite lack of data regarding risk/benefit ratio for anticoagulating many of these abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversely, we have found echocardiography use in ambulatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care to be of low yield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, direct visualization of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> might be considered a reasonable indication for anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study assesses the use of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> detection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which should present a good substrate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a chart review of patients admitted to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> department during a 6-month period, identifying and analyzing those with associated AF who were also submitted to TTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 31 patients with AF (12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and 19 new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TTE was conducted within approximately 60 +/- 41 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> was detected in only one patient with severe left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moderate to severe left ventricular function was detected in two additional patients with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no other pertinent findings in 28 of 31 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were anticoagulated on the basis of AF detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two died in hospital from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related complications and 26 of 31 were discharged home or to rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TTE has a low yield of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> detection in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic (AF-associated) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and has no impact on antithrombotic therapy in this patient population </plain></SENT>
