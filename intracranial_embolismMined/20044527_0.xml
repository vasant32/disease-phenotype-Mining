<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of embolic signals (ES) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes (ACS) and their association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From December 2004 to October 2006, 209 consecutive patients with ACS (without prosthetic heart valves or previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) were studied within 72 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent ES monitoring in both middle cerebral arteries by transcranial Doppler for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 14 months after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were treated according to current European Society Cardiology guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, 92% of patients received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>(s), 100% aspirin, 92% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, 67% intravenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa inhibitors, 9% fibrinolysis, and 67% underwent angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ES were detected in 7 patients (prevalence 3.4%; 95% CI, 1.4 to 6.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for a higher prevalence of ES in patients with unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> versus other ACS categories (8.5% versus 1.9%, P=0.047), none of the factors among baseline characteristics, clinical features, ACS treatment, and cardiac findings were associated with the presence of ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During hospitalization, 3 patients without ES had cerebrovascular events (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>), whereas no cerebrovascular events occurred in patients with ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ES among hospitalized patients with ACS is currently low, possibly because of improvement in ACS treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this ACS sample, ES did not appear associated with short-term risk of cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
