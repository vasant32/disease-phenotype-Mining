<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The feasibility and safety of combining carotid surgery and thrombolysis for occlusions of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), either as a simultaneous or as a staged procedure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nonrandomized clinical pilot study, which included patients who had severe hemispheric carotid-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusions of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, was performed between January 1994 and January 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and major infarction established by means of cerebral computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carotid reconstruction and thrombolysis was performed in 14 of 845 patients (1.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ICA was occluded in 11 patients; occlusions of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (mainstem/major branches/distal branch) or the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) were found in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three of the 14 patients, thrombolysis was performed first, followed by carotid enarterectomy (CEA) after clinical improvement (6 to 21 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 11 of 14 patients, 0.15 to 1 mIU urokinase was administered intraoperatively, ie, emergency CEA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (n = 5) or surgical reexploration after elective CEA complicated by perioperative intracerebral embolism (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 14 intracranial embolic occlusions and 10 of 11 ICA occlusions were recanalized successfully (confirmed with angiography or transcranial Doppler studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients recovered completely (Rankin 0), six patients sustained a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (Rankin 2/3), two patients had a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (Rankin 4/5), and two patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one patient, hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic infarction was detectable postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combining carotid surgery with thrombolysis (simultaneous or staged procedure) offers a new therapeutic approach in the emergency management of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Its efficacy should be evaluated in interdisciplinary studies </plain></SENT>
