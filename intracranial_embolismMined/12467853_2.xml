<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The performance of an automated system needs to be evaluated for different embolic sources on consecutively acquired typical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a new online frequency filtering approach in a total of 565 h of data containing 925 ES from four groups of patients: post carotid endarterectomy (postCEA), symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (SCS), asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (ACS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following sensitivities and specificities were achieved: postCEA = sensitivity 95.8%, specificity 88.2%; SCS = sensitivity 98.4%, specificity 88.6%; ACS = sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 13.0%; AF = sensitivity 54.8%, specificity 7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This online automated system performed similarly to the human expert in the postCEA and SCS groups, but less well in patients with AF and ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The low ratio of ES to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> data in patients with ACS may have contributed to the lower specificity; further evaluation with a higher number of ES is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Refinement of the algorithm is required to improve its sensitivity for AF data </plain></SENT>
