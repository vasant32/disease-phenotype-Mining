<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The aim of this study was to analyze delayed neurological deficits following surgical resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors report on a consecutive series of 200 patients with angiographically proven <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> of the brain that were surgically resected between January 1989 and June 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality rate for patients in this series was 1%, with one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> resection and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> attributed to basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair following successful <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Spetzler-Martin grading system correlated well with the difficulty of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No permanent incidence of morbidity resulted from resection of Grade I or II <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>; the percentage of patients with a significant neurological deficit due to resection was 7.8% for those with Grade III lesions and 33.3% for those with Grade IV or V <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, this grading system did not accurately predict the development of delayed neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (5%) developed delayed neurological deficits after recovering from anesthesia and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The delayed deficit was due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in four of the 10 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four had undergone resection of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> measuring at least 4 cm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase in blood pressure during the first 8 postoperative days precipitated <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> arising as a consequence of propagated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (two patients) was associated with extensive venous drainage networks rather than large <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> niduses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both hemorrhagic and edematous complications can be included under the umbrella term of "arterial-capillary-venous hypertensive syndrome" to describe the common underlying pathogenesis accurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An additional four patients developed a delayed deficit as a result of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm occurred when resection had involved extensive dissection of proximal anterior and middle cerebral arteries; in such cases the incidence of vasospasm was 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of their analysis of these complications, the authors recommend strict blood pressure control for patients with lesions measuring 4 cm or more in diameter (particularly those with a deep arterial supply) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thromboprophylaxis with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is prescribed for patients with extensive venous drainage networks, and prophylactic nimodipine therapy and angiographic surveillance for vasospasm are suggested for patients in whom extensive dissection of proximal anterior or middle cerebral arteries has been necessary </plain></SENT>
