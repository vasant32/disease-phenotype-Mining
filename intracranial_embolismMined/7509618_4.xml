<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty brains from patients with variable time intervals between trauma and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were fixed in 10% <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sections from the contusioned area and from the corresponding area of the contralateral hemisphere were embedded in paraffin and 50 non-traumatized brains were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After sectioning and embedding, 10 microns sections were stained with haemalum and eosin (HE) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53394">phosphotungstic acid</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> (PTAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stained fibrinous microthrombi were counted in each hemisphere and in control sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More microthrombi could be found in the contusioned areas of the brain than in the contralateral side or in control sections </plain></SENT>
