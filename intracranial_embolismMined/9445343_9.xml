<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler monitoring for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was performed over the middle cerebral arteries for 30 to 60 minutes per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of neurological complications was evaluated with a standard neurological questionnaire in patients carrying the valve implant longer than 3 months (n=369) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> prevalence and counts were noted among the 580 patients depending on valve type (presented with medians and [95% confidence intervals]): St Jude Medical, n=200, 72%, 4 [3 to 6]; Björk Shiley Monostrut, n=99, 92%, 133 [93 to 181]; Medtronic Hall, n=80, 47%, 1 [2 to 5]; ATS, n=61, 52%, 3 [2 to 5]; Tecna, n=38, 71%, 2 [1 to 4]; Carbomedics, n=37, 81%, 8 [5 to 13]; Carpentier-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> supraannular, n=54, 39%, 1 [0 to 3]; Sorin biological, n=11, 9%, 0 [0 to 0] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No relation between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts and valve size, international normalized ratio, patients' age, cardiac rhythm, or implant duration was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts or prevalence (22 [3 to 68] versus 5 [3 to 6] and 63% versus 69%, both P&gt;.05), in valve duration, valve position, valve type, patients' age, sex, cardiac rhythm, or international normalized ratio were evident between neurologically symptomatic (n=42) and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves depend on the type and, in certain valve types, the position of the valve implant and possess no direct clinical significance </plain></SENT>
