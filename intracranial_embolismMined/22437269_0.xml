<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: : It is not known whether use of a clampless facilitating device during proximal graft anastamosis decreases intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in patients with mild atherosclerotic ascending aorta (AAA) having off-pump coronary artery bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : After intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound showed no more than mild (grade I-II) atherosclerotic ascending aorta, 20 patients were randomized to receive either partial clamping (PC, n = 10) or the HEARTSTRING clampless device (HS, n = 9) for proximal graft construction on the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring, with capability to discern gaseous from solid particulates, was used intraoperatively to monitor high-intensity transient signals (HITS) in the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging documented old and new ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : There were no significant differences between the groups in the number of proximals (P = 0.14), distals (P = 0.4), or intraoperative cell saver transfusions (P = 0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of HITS was not significantly different between the PC and HS groups (P = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the number of solid HITS was significantly lower in the HS than in the PC group (2.7 ± 2.6 versus 14.0 ± 8.1; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of gaseous emboli in the HS group was fourfold greater when a mister-blower rather than a suction device was used to clear blood away from the HS site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>, or clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> observed in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed no statistical difference between groups for new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : Use of the HS device during off-pump coronary artery bypass was associated with significantly fewer intraoperative solid emboli in the middle cerebral artery than PC of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
