<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients, three male and two female (mean age 46 years at first observation), with familial 'complete' <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from a small mountain community (900 residents) have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria were: absence of P wave in any lead of the standard electrocardiogram; no electrical activity of the atria with extremely slow junctional escape rhythm on the endocavitary recordings; lack of atrial excitability; absence of atrial wall movement at fluoroscopy; no mitral A wave on the echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had marked cardiac enlargement primarily due to atrial enlargement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had impaired functional class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> for many years but none had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Permanent cardiac pacing was carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the same community there were three patients, one male and two female (mean age 34 years at first observation), with 'partial' atrial standstill characterized by absence of P waves in any lead of the standard electrocardiogram and by endocavitary recording of electrical activity limited to a localized region of the atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These three patients also had cardiac enlargement primarily due to atrial enlargement but to a lesser degree than the patients with complete <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The familial and endemic character of the disease is stressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cardiac enlargement due primarily to atrial enlargement seems to be a common feature of both the complete and partial form of the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
