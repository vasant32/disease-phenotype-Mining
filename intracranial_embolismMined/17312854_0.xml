<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advanced age is a significant risk factor for adverse neurological events following CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With full knowledge that our elderly population of patients was at high risk for these untoward neurological events, we adopted a comprehensive operative and perfusion strategy in an attempt to attenuate the incidence of these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our strategy included efforts to minimise the number of emboli generated during the operation, avoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, and attenuate the systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 15 August 2002 to 31 December 2005, we performed 355 on-pump CABG operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of Type I focal injury was 0/355 (0%), the incidence of Type II non-focal injury was 9/355 (2.5%), and postoperative mortality was 2/355 (0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results compared favorably to the results predicted by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons' (STS) model, and may suggest efficacy </plain></SENT>
