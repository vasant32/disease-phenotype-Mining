<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of radioactive microspheres as embolic agents enabled the number of microspheres to be determined in each cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The microspheres were mainly distributed in the cerebral hemisphere on the side of the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 61 rats this hemisphere contained 582 +/- 20 microspheres against 99 +/- 9 in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> was assessed by measuring brain content of water, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability was determined by brain accumulation of 125I-albumin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after embolization, significant correlations were observed between the microsphere content of the cerebral hemispheres and 1) the increases in water and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> levels, 2) the decrease in <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> level, 3) the increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study of these correlations should make it possible to ignore the poor reproducibility of embolizations and to analyze with increased accuracy the results of various experiments </plain></SENT>
