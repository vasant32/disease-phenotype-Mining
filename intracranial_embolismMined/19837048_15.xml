<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> energy production may underlie a response to NILT, but this has not been demonstrated using an in vivo embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we evaluated the effect of NILT on cortical ATP content using the rabbit small clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model (RSCEM), the model originally used to demonstrate NILT efficacy and initiate the NEST-1 clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five minutes following embolization, rabbits were exposed to 2 min of NILT using an 808 nm laser source, which was driven to output either continuous wave (CW), or pulsed wave modes (PW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three hours after embolization, the cerebral cortex was excised and processed for the measurement of ATP content using a standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25078">luciferin</z:chebi>-luciferase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NILT-treated rabbits were directly compared to sham-treated embolized rabbits and na√Øve control rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Embolization decreased cortical ATP content in ischemic cortex by 45% compared to naive rabbits, a decrease that was attenuated by CW NILT which resulted in a 41% increase in cortical ATP content compared to the sham embolized group (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absolute increase in ATP content was 22.5% compared to naive rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following PW NILT, which delivered 5 (PW1) and 35 (PW2) times more energy than CW, we measured a 157% (PW1 p=0.0032) and 221% (PW2 p=0.0001) increase in cortical ATP content, respectively, compared to the sham embolized group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>That represented a 41% and 77% increase in ATP content compared to naive control rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration that embolization can decrease ATP content in rabbit cortex and that NILT significantly increases cortical ATP content in embolized rabbits, an effect that is correlated with cortical fluence and the mode of NILT delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with clinical improvement following NILT </plain></SENT>
