<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Wake Forest, NC: Lash &amp; Associates.; APT-II], when applied in the context of a multiple baseline <z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi> design, would improve the attention abilities of RW, a patient with mild conduction <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and concomitant attention and working <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also explored whether APT-II training would enhance RW's auditory comprehension, other cognitive abilities such as memory, and his and his spouse's perceptions of his daily attention and communication difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With treatment, RW improved on trained attention tasks and made modest gains on standardized tests and probes that evaluated cognitive skills related to treatment activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nominal change in auditory comprehension and untrained attention and memory functions was observed, and neither RW nor his spouse reported noticeable improvements in his daily attention or communication abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These and previous findings indicate that structured attention retraining may enhance specific attention skills, but that positive changes in broader attention and untrained functions are less likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LEARNING OUTCOMES: As a result of reading this article, the participant will be able to: (1) summarize the previous literature regarding attention impairments and treatment approaches for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(2) describe how Attention Processing Training-II affected the attention, auditory comprehension, and other cognitive abilities of the patient in this study </plain></SENT>
