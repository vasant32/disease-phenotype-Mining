<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether, and to what extent, off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) reduces the occurrence of cerebral microemboli compared with traditional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with CPB and to compare clinical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A retrospective review of 137 patients undergoing elective CABG was performed, 70 of whom underwent traditional CABG and 67 of whom underwent OPCAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, 40 patients (20 CABG, 20 OPCAB) were continuously monitored intraoperatively for the occurrence and pattern of cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Private, university-affiliated tertiary care hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the age, sex, or underlying comorbidities between those patients undergoing CABG and OPCAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CABG patients did have a slightly lower preoperative ejection fraction (50.9% vs 55.5%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite these similar preoperative characteristics, the OPCAB group experienced significant reductions in cerebral microemboli (27 vs 1,766, p = 0.003), transfusion requirements (29.9% vs 47.1%, p = 0.04), intubation time (3.3 vs 9.5 h, p &lt; 0.001), ICU length of stay (1.5 vs 2.8 days, p = 0.02), and overall hospitalization (4.9 vs 6.6 days, p = 0.01) without an increase in mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed in the OPCAB group, but these trends failed to reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In similar patient populations, OPCAB was associated with significantly fewer cerebral microemboli and improved clinical results without an increase in mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe that these early results support OPCAB as a viable and potentially safer alternative to traditional CABG </plain></SENT>
