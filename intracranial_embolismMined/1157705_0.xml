<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The AVCO balloon pump (model 7) was used on 13 patients with cardiogenic shock and for circulatory support after open-heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients survived, but one patient died of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> which had occurred before the use of the balloon pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean systemic arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure and heart rate were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, while cardiac index and arterio-venous oxygen difference were measured in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average duration of counterpulsation was four days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasopressor treatment was reduced or discontinued in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, urinary output increased markedly and the clinical state improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although systolic pressure did not change significantly, MAP increased significantly by 25 mm Hg (P less than 0.005), with a mean diastolic pressure increase to 104 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pulmonary artery pressure, the pulmonary wedge pressure and the mean pulse rate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> decreased significantly by 25 mm Hg, 16 mm Hg and 24 beats/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A fall in arterio-venous oxygen difference of 2.6 ml/100 ml (P less than 0.025) was associated with a significant increase in cardiac index by 0.62 l/min-m2 (P less than 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded from these results that intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation may be an effective means of providing circulatory support in cardiogenic shock and after open-heart surgery </plain></SENT>
