<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine the role of asymmetry and the nature of microembolization on postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in patients who had undergone heart valve surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuous transcranial Doppler ultrasound was intraoperatively used for both middle cerebral arteries in 13 right-handed heart valve surgery patients to detect microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Trail Making Test A and B, Memory with 10/30 s interference, the Digit Span Test and Phonemic Fluency were performed preoperatively, at discharge and three months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that early and late postoperative psychomotor and executive functions may be sensitive to microemboli in the left, but not in the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, solid and gaseous microemboli are both similarly associated with early postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> while, surprisingly, late postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> is more likely to be associated with gaseous than solid microemboli </plain></SENT>
