<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These signals (gaseous or materials) are recorded in many situations such as cardiac prosthetic valves, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, carotid surgery or angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical value is not well known: neurological impairment associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> is described in case of cardiac prosthetic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observation of HITS in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The detection of HITS offers a new orientation in studying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but some technical and/or clinical difficulties have to be solved </plain></SENT>
