<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of associated risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (66%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (47%), cigarette smoking (37%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (20%), moderate alcohol consumption (19%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most frequently occurring type of lesions were multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> of the brain (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were combined with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in an additional 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Atherosclerotic occlusive disease</z:e> of the carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries occurred alone in 18% and was associated with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in another 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262004" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Embolic cerebral infarctions</z:e> were present alone in 8% and were combined with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MID was more frequent in men (62%) than women (p less than 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean bihemispheric gray matter cerebral blood flow (CBF) values showed a fluctuating course and when results were pooled and compared between different types of MID, extracranial occlusive disease and/or multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> resulted in lowest CBF values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> was more importantly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> than was the total volume of infarcted brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates among 125 MID patients followed for 31 months has been 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Correct clinical classification of the types of cerebrovascular lesions was confirmed in three necropsied cases </plain></SENT>
