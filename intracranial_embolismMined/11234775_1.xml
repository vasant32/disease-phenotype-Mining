<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator, t-PA) and pamiteplase (a modified t-PA with longer half-life and increased potency) were compared in a clinically relevant model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated with pamiteplase (0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg bolus), alteplase (10 mg/kg infusion) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pamiteplase (1 mg/kg) was as effective as alteplase in reducing 24 h brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, neurological deficit scores and residual clot grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow recovery at 30 min after thrombolytic treatment was partial and did not correlate with 24 h <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes or neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was good correlation between 24 h residual clot grades and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, suggesting a delayed timeframe for pamiteplase- and alteplase-induced reperfusion </plain></SENT>
