<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conducted this study to determine whether the prevalence of ES is high in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and related to hypercoagulopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) distribution on diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms (CSMs) were determined using cardiologic and vascular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the coagulation status was assessed based on the serum D-dimer levels, and TCD monitoring was performed on both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> for 30 minutes to detect ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical features including vascular risk factors, characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and laboratory findings associated with the presence of ES were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 74 patients were finally included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ES was more commonly observed in patients without CSMs (22 of 38 patients, 57.9%) than in those with CSMs (12 of 36 patients, 33.3%) (p = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ES was more commonly detected in patients with high D-dimer levels (p &lt; 0.001), and D-dimer levels were significantly correlated with the number of ESs in patients without CSMs (r = 0.732, p &lt; 0.001), but were poorly correlated in patients with CSMs (r = 0.152, p = 0.375) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of D-dimer (odds ratio [OR], 1.082 per 1 microg/ml increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.014-1.154) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OR, 3.829; 95% CI, 1.23-13.052) were independently associated with the presence of ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> dramatically decreased the D-dimer levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: A high prevalence of ES was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, especially in those without CSMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Elevated D-dimer levels were independently associated with ES, and decreased dramatically with the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
