<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the cerebral blood flow dynamics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> has already been studied by many investigators, the CSF flow dynamics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> has not been well discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to investigate CSF flow dynamics in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by RI cisternography and our new quantitative method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, the flow of CSF was estimated following intrathecal injection of 169Yb-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> or 111In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, in addition to the conventional cisternograms, quantitative evaluation of CSF flow was performed in 6 patients by our method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our previous work included the quantitative CSF flow dynamics in 26 various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234387" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral disorders</z:e> using RI Anger camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method consisted of following procedure: 30 minutes after RI injection, RI activity was studied continuously for 30 minutes, afterwards playing back the record to calculate the changes of RI activity in the optimal regions of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These operations were performed with Anger camera, accessory digital ratemeter and tape-recorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The changes of RI activity which appeared to be linear is called flow rate in our study for convenience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this report, the region of interest was selected at Sylvian cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>6 patients had abnormal cisternograms consisting of reflux of tracer into the ventricle and delayed migration of tracer to the basal cisterns and diminished flow of tracer in the affected hemisphers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients whose cisternograms could not demonstrate the laterality of RI perfsion over the cerebral hemishere, a marked difference of flow rate between right and left Sylvian cisterns was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings probably indicated the correlation between cerebral blood flow dynamics and CSF flow dynamics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was confirmed that our method could be of clinical use to evaluate CSF flow dynamics quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanisms of CSF flow disturbance in the affected hemisphere following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was discussed </plain></SENT>
