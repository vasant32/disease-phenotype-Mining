<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, sometimes no macroscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> is found at autopsy in the heart of a victim of this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated morphological changes in the left atrial endocardium of 31 patients (including 21 cases with AF) who had died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>. "Rough endocardium" (RE) seen macroscopically provided evidence for the existence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001855'>atrial thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RE that appeared in AF cases was due to a granular and wrinkled appearance of the endocardium associated with oedematous and fibrous thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrin-thread deposits were also always distinguishable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> with neutrophil infiltration in the subendocardium could be seen under the microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small areas of endothelial denudation and thrombotic aggregations were commonly observed by scanning electron microscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> lesions were significantly more frequent in cases with AF than in controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic success rate for <z:mp ids='MP_0001855'>atrial thrombosis</z:mp> among cases with AF increased from 33.3% to 81% when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> proven by histological investigation of the areas with RE were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Left atrial RE may be an anatomically relevant finding for the existence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001855'>atrial thrombosis</z:mp> with AF, when the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> cannot be detected upon gross observation at autopsy </plain></SENT>
