<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> (RLS) and white matter lesions (WMLs) are frequently observed in migraineurs and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported that the burden of WMLs did not increase with the intracardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) in migraineurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, some types of WMLs are known to be associated with RLS in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to demonstrate the difference in the size and location of WMLs, according to the existence of RLS in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> registry, a total of 425 subjects (age, 30.8 ± 5.1 years; 303 women; 242 migraineurs; 183 patients with tension-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (TTH)) were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated for RLS and WMLs using M-mode power transcranial Doppler sonography (mTCD) and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We scored WMLs, according to the Rotterdam Scan Study, and assessed the association between RLS presence and the location and size of WMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of small deep WMLs (dWMLs) and the prevalence of RLS, defined as microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) ≥ 11, were higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (small dWMLs, 6.23 vs. 4.05; RLS, 36.8% vs. 10.9%), compared to patients with TTH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the sum of periventricular WML grades or the total volume of dWMLs between TTH and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the migraineurs, the patients with RLS more frequently had small dWMLs, aura, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> compared to those without RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, RLS were also independent predictors for the presence of small dWMLs from the multivariate binary regression analysis (p &lt; 0.01; OR = 3.24; 95%CI 1.56-6.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Small dWMLs are associated with RLS in young migraineurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results imply that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> may cause the small WMLs in some migraineurs </plain></SENT>
