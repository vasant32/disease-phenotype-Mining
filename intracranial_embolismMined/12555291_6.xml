<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the efficacy of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran 40</z:chebi> at controlling symptoms and emboli before elective carotid endarterectomy in patients with recurrent or crescendo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective study, patients with more than 70 per cent internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> who had two or more symptomatic episodes within 30 days and TCD-detected microemboli were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran 40</z:chebi> was commenced at 20 ml/h and TCD was repeated to reassess the rate of embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The infusion was increased in 20-ml/h increments until symptoms and emboli were controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient then had carotid surgery on the next elective list </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients with internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> greater than 70 per cent, recurrent symptoms and TCD-detected emboli were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had symptoms and emboli controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran 40</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with both unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (awaiting urgent operation) and crescendo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> died from a myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> before undergoing operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 patients who had an operation, one suffered a non-disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the third postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TCD-directed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran 40</z:chebi> offers a safe approach to high-risk patients before elective carotid endarterectomy, and warrants further study </plain></SENT>
