<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Vmax value of NA uptake, when analyzed by the Eadie-Hofstee plot, tended to decrease on the 1st day and decreased on the 3rd and 7th days after the embolism without any change in the Km value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NA content in cerebrocortical synaptosomes did not alter on the 1st day, but decreased on the 3rd and 7th days after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">Ouabain</z:chebi> (1 mM) inhibited NA uptake on the 1st day, but did not alter the uptake on the 3rd and 7th days after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>/K+-ATPase of cerebrocortical synaptosomes increased on the 1st day and gradually decreased up to the 7th day after the embolim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NA uptake in nerve terminals of the cerebral cortex decreased after microsphere embolism, which may be due to a reduction in function of NA transporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>/K+-ATPase following microsphere embolism may represent a compensatory action to maintain ion homeostasis in nerve terminals at an early stage of ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
