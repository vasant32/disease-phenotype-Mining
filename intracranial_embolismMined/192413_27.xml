<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Review of the neurological complications encountered in 83 patients who received cardiac homografts over a seven-year period leads to the following conclusions: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological disorders</z:e> are common in transplant recipients, occurring in over 50 per cent of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> was the single most frequent cause of the neurological dysfunction, being responsible for one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(3) The infective organisms were typically those considered to be usually of low pathogenicity: fungi, viruses, protozoa and an uncommon <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(4) Other clinical neurological syndromes were related to vascular lesions, often apparently from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> or infarction occurring during the surgical procedure, metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathies</z:hpo>, cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280803" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">microglioma</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000725'>psychotic episodes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002953'>vertebral compression fractures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(5) The infectious complications and probably the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> de novo, are related to immunosuppressive therapy which impairs virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> host defence mechanisms and alters the nature of the host's response to infective agents or other foreign antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(6) Because neurological symptoms and signs were usually those of behavioural changes or deterioration in intellectual performance, the neurological examination was often of little value in diagnosing the nature or even the anatomical site of the neuropathological process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(7) The possibility of an infectious origin of the neurological manifestations must be aggressively pursued even in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and a significantly abnormal spinal fluid examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic error made most frequently was to ascribe neurological symptoms erroneously to metabolic disturbances or to "intensive care unit <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo>" when they were in fact due to unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011450'>CNS infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(8) Maintenance of mean cardiopulmonary bypass pressures above 70 mmHg, particularly in patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, may reduce operative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(9) Though increased diagnostic accuracy is possible with routine use of a variety of radiological and laboratory techniques, two further requirements probably must be met before a significant reduction in the frequency of neurological complications will occur: the advent of greater immunospecificity in suppressing rejection of the grafted organ while preserving defences against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>; and a more effective armamentarium of antiviral and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
