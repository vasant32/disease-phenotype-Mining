<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lacking matched controls we used a reference population of 103 elderly subjects selected at random from the general population for a previous LTER study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permanent or episodic atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> of types known to cause cerebral embolization were detected by LTER in 32 (47%) of the 68 patients with a clinical diagnosis of cerebral embolization or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and in 6 (33%) of the 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 38 patients with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during LTER 17 had such <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in their standard ECGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This frequency of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during LTER differs from that of the reference population (p less than 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 16 patients with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> had signs of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during LTER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients having occult atrial disorder with episodic atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> may be an important and common risk group for non-hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in addition to the previously recognized group of patients with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detectable in the standard ECG </plain></SENT>
