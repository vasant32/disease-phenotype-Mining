<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduced rCBF was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of rCBF reduction was mild, moderate, or severe and ranged between 6 and 80% from the lowest age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values obtained in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency indices remained within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits (mean - 10.4 Hz) in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slower frequencies (mean - 6.3 Hz) were recorded in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the two parameters (P = 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the EEG frequency and the rCBF are known to be closely related to the cerebral metabolic rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed rCBF <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> without concomitant changes in the EEG frequency raises the question of the role of globally-reduced cerebral metabolism as the cause of rCBF reduction in the noninfarcted hemisphere in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings constitute additional evidence that the contralateral hemisphere is involved in the haemodynamic changes occurring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
