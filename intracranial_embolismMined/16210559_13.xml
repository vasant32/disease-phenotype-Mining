<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protected CAS is currently used to prevent distal embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is the most sensitive tool to evaluate silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this research was to assess the incidence of cerebral embolic lesions during CAS and to evaluate whether cerebral protection devices can reduce the number of silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with respect to unprotected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-two patients with high-grade internal stenosis underwent CAS; 30 patients (group a) were treated with a cerebral protection device, and 22 (group b) were treated without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and DWI sequences to depict the number of new embolic silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Embolic silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> occurred in 30% of CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protection devices reduce the number of new lesions significantly reducing the consistent lesions ipsilateral to the treated vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inconsistent lesions do not differ in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical, radiological, and procedural variables do not correlate with the appearance of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> detected with DWI are more frequent with unprotected CAS, although they are present also with the use of cerebral protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Probably a part of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> arise from the procedural maneuver in the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
