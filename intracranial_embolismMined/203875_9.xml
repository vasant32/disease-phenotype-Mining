<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, SEP'S evoked by BS were symmetric between the homologous areas of the two hemispheres and resembled the response contralateral to unilateral stimulation (US) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with a cerebral lesion, BS responses were not only asymmetric but often differed in wave form from the response of the affected hemisphere to contralateral US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These alterations were attributed to the cumulative interactions of the anomalous contralateral and ipsilateral components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The additional use of BS made it possible to demonstrate SEP abnormalities that might have been regarded as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or equivocal if only the US method had been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurophysiologic mechanisms of the origin of SEP are discussed </plain></SENT>
