<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current data suggest microembolization to the brain may result in long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> despite the absence of immediate clinically obvious cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed a series of patients treated electively with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid artery stenting (CAS) with distal filters, and carotid stenting with flow reversal (FRS) monitored continuously with transcranial Doppler scan (TCD) during the procedure to detect microembolization rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TCD insonation of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery was conducted during 42 procedures (15 CEA, 20 CAS, and 7 FRS) in 41 patients seen at an academic center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had staged bilateral CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral microembolic signals (MESs) were divided into three phases: preprotection phase (until internal carotid artery [ICA] cross-shunted or clamped if no shunt was used, filter deployed, or flow reversal established), protection phase (until clamp/shunt was removed, filter removed, or antegrade flow re-established), and postprotection phase (after clamp/shunt was removed, filter removed, or antegrade flow re-established) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics are reported as mean ± SE for continuous variables and N (%) for categorical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in ipsilateral emboli counts based on cerebral protection strategy were assessed using nonparametric methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TCD insonation and procedural success were obtained in 33 procedures (79%; 14 CEA, 14 CAS, and 5 FRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Highest ipsilateral MESs were observed for CAS (319.3 ± 110.3), followed by FRS (184.2 ± 110.5), and CEA (15.3 ± 22.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pairwise comparisons revealed significantly higher ipsilateral MESs with both FRS and CAS when compared to CEA (P = .007 for FRS and P &lt; .001 for CAS vs CEA, respectively), whereas the difference in MESs between FRS and CAS was not significant (P = .053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Periods of maximum embolization were postprotection phase for CEA, protection phase for CAS, and preprotection phase for FRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preprotection MESs were frequently observed during both CAS and FRS (20.4% and 63.3% of total MESs across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phases, respectively), and the primary difference between these two methods seemed to be related to lower MESs during the protection phase with FRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CEA is associated with lower rates of microembolization compared with carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Flow reversal may represent a procedural modification with potential to reduce microembolization during carotid stenting; further investigation is warranted to determine the relationship between cerebral protection strategies and outcomes associated with carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
