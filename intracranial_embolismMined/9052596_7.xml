<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine nationally representative estimates of the incidence of peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and to identify potential risk factors for these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed National Hospital Discharge Survey data for the period 1979-1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nationally representative estimates of risk were calculated by age, race, method of delivery, presence of pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, census region, hospital ownership, and number of hospital beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models were developed using logistic and Poisson regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were an estimated 5484 cases of peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 4454 cases of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the United States among 50,110,949 deliveries (risk, 10.3 cases of peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 8.9 cases of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> per 100,000 deliveries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both univariate and multivariate models, peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was associated strongly with cesarean delivery, pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, proprietary hospital ownership, and larger hospital size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was strongly associated with cesarean delivery and less strongly with smaller hospital size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> are common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complications of pregnancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the associations identified in this study are plausible, further studies are required to confirm these associations and elucidate the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
