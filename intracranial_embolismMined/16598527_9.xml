<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic parameters elevate this risk significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is little knowledge about the long-term fate and the rate of clinically silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> under continued oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of our study were to assess prognosis of patients with AF and determine a high risk group with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> under oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with persistent or permanent AF and left atrial (LA) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, dense spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) and/or reduced LA appendage peak emptying velocities (LAAv) were included in the study (N = 128) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF and without echocardiographic risk factors (N = 114) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined with transesophageal echocardiography, cranial magnetic resonance imaging and clinically during a period of three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the three-year follow-up period 6 (5%) of the high risk patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 (3%) patients died due to embolic events and 17 (13%) patients had silent embolism as documented on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the control group 8 (7%) patients had embolic events (n = 1 clinically apparent and n = 7 silent embolism) documented on MRI, one was clinically apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Study patients with an event had more commonly previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with peristent or permanent AF and LA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, dense SEC or reduced LAAv have an explicitly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (21%) despite oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Previous thromboembolic event is another important predictor for an event </plain></SENT>
