<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We investigated immunoreactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF), a platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule, in the endocardial endothelium and its relationship to thrombogenesis in the human atrial appendage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intra-atrial thrombogenesis is generally thought to be induced by blood stasis in the atrial appendage involved with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little attention has been paid to alterations of the endocardial endothelium on which the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> develops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Atrial appendage tissue was obtained at heart surgery or at autopsy from AF and non-AF cardiac patients and from noncardiac patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for endothelial cell markers including vWF, CD31, CD34 and endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) and platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> Ib/IX or IIb/IIIa was performed and semiquantitatively graded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In contrast to the apparent immunostaining for CD31, CD34 and eNOS, only focal or little immunoreactive vWF was seen in the endocardium of noncardiac patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive vWF in the endocardial endothelium was increased in most cardiac patients, particularly in the left, but not in the right, atrial appendage of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valvular disease</z:e>, irrespective of whether AF was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the endocardium was found in limited sites in which the overlying endothelium was deficient in eNOS and CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-treated cases were excluded, there was a significant correlation between the immunohistochemical grade for vWF and the degree of platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the endocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunoreactive vWF in the endocardial endothelium was increased in overloaded human atrial appendage, which may be a local predisposing factor for intraatrial thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
