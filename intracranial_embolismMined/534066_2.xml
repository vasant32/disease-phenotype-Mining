<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study compared the superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis patency in animals with and without proximal embolic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen dogs underwent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass in association with <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> embolization of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> via an internal carotid injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals re-explored 3 to 5 days postoperatively with evaluation of anastomosis patency by Evans blue injection and direct cutting of the STA demonstrated that 10 of 10 dogs with proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> emboli had a patent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, whereas only 2 of 6 animals without an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> lodged in the proximal middle cerebral artery had a patent connection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of the anastomosis remaining open seems to be greatly influenced by the potential flow gradient between the extracranial and intracranial circulations (Neurosurgery, 5: 596--597, 1979) </plain></SENT>
