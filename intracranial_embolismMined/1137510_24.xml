<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To answer these important questions, experience with 198 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SAH patients (every patient had a cerebral angiogram demonstrating one or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experience with these 198 consecutive patients led to the conclusions that (1) there is no clinical picture consistently present coincident with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>; (2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> has no effect on the mortality from SAH due to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>; and (3) there is no relationship between the frequency and severity of the complications from surgical or conservative treatment and the presence or absence of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
