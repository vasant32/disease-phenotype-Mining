<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of delayed treatment with nebracetam, a novel nootropic drug, on <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> of brain regions were examined in rats with microsphere embolism-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral ischaemia</z:e> was induced by administration of 900 microspheres (48 microns) into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like symptoms were treated p.o. with 30 mg kg-1 nebracetam twice daily </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the microsphere embolism induced significant changes in most of the <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> and some of their metabolites in the brain regions, the delayed treatment with nebracetam partially restored only the hippocampal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and the striatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> metabolite contents on the 3rd day </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vivo striatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> turnover rate of the rats with microsphere embolism was inhibited on the 3rd day irrespective of treatment with nebracetam </plain></SENT>
