<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A major concern with carotid artery stenting (CAS) is the potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether integrated backscatter (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>) ultrasound and black-blood magnetic resonance imaging (BB-MRI) can predict the risk of a silent ischemic lesion after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed quantitative analysis of plaque characteristics in carotid arteries using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> ultrasound and BB-MRI before CAS in 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> values and the signal intensity ratio (SIR) from T1 weighted images of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also performed diffusion-weighted (DWI) MRI of the brain before and after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the patient group that was positive (n=19) for newly appearing ipsilateral silent ischemic lesions (NISIL), relative unstable component area (%UCA) evaluated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> analysis (60.2+/-23.4% and 35.3+/-19.2%, p&lt;0.001) and SIR (1.40+/-0.19 and 1.18+/-0.25, p&lt;0.01) in most stenotic lesions were higher than in the NISIL-negative group (n=31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves, 50% of the %UCA measured by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> and an SIR of 1.25 measured by BB-MRI were the most reliable cutoff values for predicting NISIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the independent predictors of NISIL were SIR (p=0.030), the CRP level (p=0.041) and the %UCA measured by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> (p=0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative tissue characterization of carotid plaques using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> ultrasound and BB-MRI was useful to predict NISIL after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The plaque components in carotid arteries should be evaluated by BB-MRI or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> ultrasound before CAS to improve the clinical outcome of this procedure </plain></SENT>
