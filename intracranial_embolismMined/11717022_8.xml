<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Cerebral microembolisation still occurs during cardiopulmonary bypass and may cause both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the frequency of cerebral embolisation during coronary artery bypass surgery with modern cardiopulmonary bypass and related these to ascending aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler monitoring for cerebral embolisation to both middle cerebral arteries was performed in 65 patients undergoing coronary artery surgery with non-pulsatile alpha-stat hypothermic bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epicardial ultrasound imaging of ascending aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was performed in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients (56.9%) had more than 200 emboli entering the middle cerebral artery territories during surgery; most at the start of bypass and during defibrillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Readjustment of aortic clamps and aortic cannulation also caused a large number of emboli which were probably particulate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aortic disease</z:e> was mild (mean plaque thickness 1 mm, interquartile range 0.9-1.2 mm) and did not relate to the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> produced by aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral embolisation remains common during coronary surgery despite advances in filter and bypass pump technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic manipulation and clamping was associated with emboli but epicardial ultrasound imaging was of little help in its prediction </plain></SENT>
