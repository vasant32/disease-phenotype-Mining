<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether paradoxical embolisation through a venous-to-arterial circulation shunt (v-a) could lead to cerebral embolisation during elective hip or knee arthroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), following the intravenous injection of microbubble contrast, identified the presence of a shunt in 41 patients undergoing hip (n = 20) or knee (n = 21) arthroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intra-operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was detected during continuous TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 41 patients, 34 had a v-a shunt of whom 18 had an embolism and embolism only occurred in patients with a shunt (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous and larger shunts were associated with a greater number of emboli (rs = 0.67 and rs = 0.71 respectively, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Observations in two patients with large spontaneous shunts revealed 368 and 203 emboli and unexplained post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paradoxical cerebral embolisation only occurred in patients with a shunt and may explain both postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome following surgery </plain></SENT>
