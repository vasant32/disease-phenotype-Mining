<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied 42 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid T occlusion, age 66 (59 to 74) years (median [interquartile range]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T occlusion was diagnosed with transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD; n = 11) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (n = 28) or CT (n = 3) angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Final infarction size was evaluated on follow-up CT 3 to 7 days after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and recanalization by follow-up TCD 24 to 36 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 18 (16 to 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was one-third or less of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory in 11, greater than one-third but less than or equal to two-thirds of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in 10, and greater than two-thirds of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 6 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 2 in 7 (17%), 3 in 2 (5%), 4 in 13 (31%), 5 in 7 (17%), and 6 in 13 (31%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete or partial <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization within 24 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was observed in 12 of 18 patients treated with thrombolysis and 4 of the remaining 24 patients (p = 0.001) and was associated with better clinical outcome (mRS 2, recanalization 6/7 [86%]; mRS 3 to 5, recanalization 8/22 [36%]; mRS 6, recanalization 2/13 [15%]; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recanalization and NIHSS score on admission were independent predictors of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> carotid T occlusion does not necessarily carry a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IV thrombolysis frequently results in recanalization, which is related to a better clinical outcome and smaller final infarction size </plain></SENT>
