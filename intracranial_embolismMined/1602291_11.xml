<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two symptomatic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and one myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> occurred in the controls, compared to no events in patients on aspirin during a total observation period of 343 d (range 28-49 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean vegetation area decreased in the aspirin group (mean change = -0.24 cm2), compared to an increase in controls (mean change = +0.35 cm2) </plain></SENT>
