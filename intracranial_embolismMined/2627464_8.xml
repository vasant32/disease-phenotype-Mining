<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each patient also had 10 neuropsychological tests before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Harvey H1700 bubble oxygenator was used for 23 patients and a Cobe <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> sheet membrane oxygenator was used for 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 23 (100%) of patients in the bubble oxygenator group had <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular occlusions consistent with microembolism compared to 8/17 (47%) in the membrane oxygenator group (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In those retinas with occlusions, the mean resultant area of non-perfusion was less in the membrane oxygenator group (0.11 mm2; n = 8) than in the bubble oxygenator group (0.29 mm2; P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> levels during bypass were similar in both groups at moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, but the mean PaO2 during rewarming was higher in the bubble oxygenator group (27 kPa) than in the membrane group (13 kPa; P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological deficits were more common and more severe after bubble oxygenation than after membrane oxygenation, but in this small patient group, the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that flat sheet membrane oxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass may confer significant protection against cerebrovascular microembolism </plain></SENT>
