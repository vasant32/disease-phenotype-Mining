<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the perfluorocarbon emulsion, AF0144 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38803">Perflubron</z:chebi>, Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp, San Diego, CA), used in conjunction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> normovolemic hemodilution on cerebral blood flow and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> measurements during coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six adult cardiac surgical patients were enrolled in a single-institution, randomized, controlled, single-blind dose escalation trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autologous whole blood was harvested from each patient to target an on-bypass hematocrit of 20% to 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Placebo, low dose (1.8 g/kg) or high dose (2.7 g/kg) AF0144 was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was used to quantitate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 clearance was used to measure cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral blood flow was increased in both AF0144-treated groups compared with placebo (p = 0.006, low dose vs control; p = 0.036, high dose vs control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> were greater in the high-dose AF0144-treated group versus control during the time periods from aortic cannulation through aortic cross-clamp placement (p = 0.026) and from aortic cross-clamp placement through cross-clamp removal (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The perfluorocarbon emulsion, AF0144, increased cerebral blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> load during bypass was greater in patients receiving high-dose AF0144 </plain></SENT>
