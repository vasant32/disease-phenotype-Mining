<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> large vessel occlusions were treated with the Revive device between October 2010 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale on admission was 19.0; mean duration of symptoms was 172 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was assessed using the Thrombolysis In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral Infarction</z:e> score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale) after thrombectomy was determined on Day 1, at discharge, and at Day 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vessel recanalization (Thrombolysis In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral Infarction</z:e> 2b or 3) was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without device-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale 24 hours after the intervention, at discharge, and at Day 30 was 14.0, 11.5, and 5.1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At Day 30, 6 patients had a clinical improvement of &gt;8 points or an National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale of 0 to 1, 1 patient showed minor improvement, and 3 patients had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 2 patients, of which 1 was fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thrombectomy with the Revive device in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> large vessel occlusions demonstrated to be technically safe and highly effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical safety and efficacy have to be established in larger clinical trials </plain></SENT>
