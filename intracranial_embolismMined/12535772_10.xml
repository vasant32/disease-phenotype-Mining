<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were produced in rats by injecting small plastic beads into the left heart ventricle under short-acting anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome was tested 24 h later by subjecting the animals to a series of consecutive behavioral tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the rats were anesthetized and underwent magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On average about seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> per brain were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The volume of the individual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was largest in the hippocampus (mean=4.26 mm(3)) and smallest in the white matter (mean=0.83 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Embolized animals performed spontaneous and evident locomotion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The activity was, however, significantly decreased compared to rats treated with vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More specific tests for motor ability revealed reduced gait capacity and muscular strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship was found between behaviors reflecting motor ability and the total volume of infarcted tissue in the brain stem, cortex and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also the behavioral profile of risk and benefit assessment was found to be altered by the microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the combination of the microembolization method and behavioral tests provides a valuable tool for further studies of the pathophysiology of, and potential treatment for, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
