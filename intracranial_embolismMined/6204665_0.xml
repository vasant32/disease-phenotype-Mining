<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To compare cerebral circulation in aphasic patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> against those who with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, we studies 50 patients with hypertensive intracranial (putaminal) <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> whose diagnoses were confirmed on repeated CT scan and cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by the 133Xe intraarterial injection method was carried out in 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The evolution of the aphasic syndrome was analyzed according to Hirano's classification and the patients were divided into two groups: those having a favorable recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>; those with a poor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve out of 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> showed a favorable recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, whose left hemispheric mean blood flow (mCBF) was 33.1 +/- 9.7 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mCBF was 30.8 +/- 10.3 ml/100 g/min in 8 patients with a poor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in mCBF values between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The favorable recovery group showed slightly higher regional values in the left frontal and temporal lobes than did the poor recovery group, but no significant difference was found between the two group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, rCBF values failed to correlate between the two kinds of recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The marked variability in rCBF values in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage might partly account for the poor correlation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a series of rCBF studies demonstrated that rCBF values stabilized in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine out of 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> had a favorable recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
