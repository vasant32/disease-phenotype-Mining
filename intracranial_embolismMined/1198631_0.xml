<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of brain scanning in the diagnosis and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was evaluated in 313 serial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 38 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>), only one had a positive test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optimal time for scanning completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was between seven and 14 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of uptake was characteristic of a vascular lesion in 76.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When uptake was indistinguishable from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, follow-up scans were useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with negative scans in the second week have a significantly better prognosis than the ones with a positive study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography and brain scan correlated well in 56 patients who had both tests performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The postmortem findings in 12 cases again emphasize the importance of the correct timing of the study, and the fact that a brain scan does not usually demonstrate lesions smaller than 2 cm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the brain scan represents a useful tool in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and helps in predicting the degree of recovery following a vascular insult </plain></SENT>
