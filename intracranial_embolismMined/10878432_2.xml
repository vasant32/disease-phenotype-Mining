<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of our work was to systematically study the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in non-selected patients with a first-ever hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and to evaluate the clinical usefulness of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 182 consecutive patients with hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and 54-age-matched healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) monitoring was performed for at least 30 min with a mean time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to TCD of 69 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity on admission, early recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and dependency on discharge were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 20.5% of patients with arterial sources of embolism, 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1% of patients with potential sources of cardioembolism and 5% of patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were not registered, however, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity on admission of patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was greater than that of patients without <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1 vs. 19.4% with the Canadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale &lt; or =6.5; p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was more frequent in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (11.8%) than in those without <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (4.2%) although the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> increased the risk of dependency on discharge (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.2-14.9; p = 0.01) independently of age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity on admission and presence of an arterial or cardiac embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with known potential arterial and cardiac embolic sources </plain></SENT>
