<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The use of left ventricular assist devices has become an established method in bridging patients with end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> to heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> is one of the major complications, we undertook this study to evaluate the clinical significance of Doppler microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in patients with left ventricular assist devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six patients with left ventricular assist devices were monitored for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography during the first 30 postoperative days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, repeated (10 per day and patient) and prolonged (3 hours per patient) monitorings were performed to assess the adequacy of the 30-minute recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three observers evaluated 30 randomly assigned monitorings in a blinded fashion to assess the interobserver variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relation between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts and clinical, radiological, hemostaseological, and pump flow parameters and the predictive value of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts regarding the occurrence of embolic events was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> and 2 peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> occurred during the observation period of 177 days (total incidence, 6.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were found in 143 of 170 monitorings (84.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their counts were significantly higher on days with clinically manifest embolic events as compared with event-free days (18.5 [3-74] versus 4 [0-52], respectively, median and 95% CI; P &lt; .001, Mann-Whitney) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts above 7 per 30 minutes was high (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in the incidence and counts of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> as well as in the incidence of clinically manifest embolic events were noted among the six patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .01) without equal differences in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment or pump flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was high (p = .78 to .89, unpaired Student's t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Considerable short- and long-term intrapatient variations of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts, without consistent pattern, were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serial monitoring for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> is prognostically superior to single monitorings in patients with left ventricular assist devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the future, this new application mode may individually guide anticoagulation strategies and even influence the decision regarding early cardiac transplantation versus long-term use of the assist devices </plain></SENT>
