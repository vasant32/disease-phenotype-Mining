<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 62-year-old female presented with symptomatic right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single-site access for revascularization of critical innominate <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> with simultaneous cerebral embolic protection performed for this diagnosis has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial nontarget self-expanding stent deployment within the right subclavian artery resulted in entrapment of the embolic protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The device was retrieved through snare fixation and resheathing within a 6-French guide catheter navigated through common femoral artery access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Innominate artery balloon-mounted stent angioplasty was performed preceded by the embolic device retrieval, with complete resolution of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endovascular distal protection device placement for prevention of cerebral atherothromboembolism during innominate artery stent angioplasty is not without risk and utilization needs to be carefully considered </plain></SENT>
