<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is the gold standard for detecting potential cardiac sources of embolism (PCSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of TOE in patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm (NSR) and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively analysed 1833 consecutive patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with NSR and no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> who were examined by TOE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the frequency of PCSE and aortic plaques detected in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Determination of high- and medium-risk PCSE was based on the Trial of ORG 10172 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors also determined how the proportions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and treatment strategies based on current guidelines have been changed after TOE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PCSE and/or aortic plaques were detected in 753 (41.1%) of 1833 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After TOE, a total of 355 PCSE (45 high-risk PCSE and 310 medium-risk PCSE) were found in 323 patients (17.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic plaques were found in 502 patients (27.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among these, complex aortic plaques, which are significant sources of embolism, were found in 157 patients (8.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in treatment strategies for secondary prevention based on the current guidelines would have been necessary in 63 patients (3.4 %) after TOE examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Potential embolic sources from the heart and aorta can be detected by TOE examination in many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with NSR and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, which enables a better determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
