<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Five dogs have been embolized by air infusion into the venous system, then sacrificed and the pulmonary vasculature isolated by ligatures while ventilation was maintained for a further hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a sixth animal, the embolization was omitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lungs were back-perfused with plasma from the same dog and successive aliquots of the back-flushings analysed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), each spot being removed for <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the major <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> component was the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">cholines</z:chebi>, while lysophosphatidyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">cholines</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16000,23981">ethanolamines</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelins</z:chebi> were also identified in significant quantities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> balance for the lungs showed a significant migration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> from the tissue into pulmonary blood, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">cholines</z:chebi> increasing by a factor of 10.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This migration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi> is discussed as an important factor in determining whether trapped pulmonary air emboli are released into the arterial system when their surface area is reduced by pressurization, suggesting that recompression should not be too rapid </plain></SENT>
