<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> hepatic damage was produced consistently in guinea pigs given a single dose of 400 micrograms/kg of tunicamycin and observed at intervals up to 72 h post-injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant elevations occurred in serum levels of liver enzymes and ammonia, while concentrations of serum proteins were lowered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A periportal pattern of hepatocellular damage, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of many hepatocytes, was consistently observed by 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe vacuolation of hepatocytes resulted from <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum, and bile ductule <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Swollen hepatocyte cytoplasm protruded into many hepatic blood vessels, and detached portions of hepatocytes produced emboli in pulmonary and cerebral capillaries, thus contributing to capillary occlusion in the brains of treated guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
