<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article reports the procedural details and clinical results of our series of neurosalvage techniques to manage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> during carotid procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2003 and December 2007, 342 patients (283 men, 72.1 +/- 8.9 years old, 121 symptomatic) underwent percutaneous stent deployment in 407 cervical internal carotid arteries in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visible distal embolization with flow occlusion caused neurologic complications in 10 patients (2.5%), and a structured and stepwise neurosalvage approach was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Guidewire fragmentation and microcatheter injection of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients as step 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial thrombolysis was given in four patients and balloon angioplasty in five, as step 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracranial stenting was done in one patient as the last step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Successful angiographic recanalization (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> [TIMI] grade 2-3) occurred in 9 of 10 (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Residual neurologic sequel was observed in five, including three patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> complications (1 received emergent craniotomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no neurologic mortality in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> embolic complication during carotid artery stenting can be managed by catheter-based neurosalvage with effective angiographic recanalization and marginal clinical success </plain></SENT>
