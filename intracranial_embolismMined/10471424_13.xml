<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp>, and to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> is an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a case-control study of 59 diabetic patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> due to thrombotic <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, who were considered cases, and 180 diabetic patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, matched by gender, age, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WHO criteria for verified definite or possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were used to ascertain the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of this study <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> was defined as a 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate of &gt;/=20 and &lt;200 microg/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors included were smoking, blood pressure, body mass index, serum total cholesterol, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> proportion and systolic and diastolic blood pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both frequency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> used were similar among subjects with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the ORs and 95% CIs for the variables identified as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were as follows: systolic pressure (OR 3.10; 95% CI 3.01 to 4.21; P=0.03); diastolic pressure (OR 3.30; 95% CI 1.04 to 4.48; P&lt;0.0001); fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;/=11.1 mmol (OR 1.82; 905% CI 1.4 to 3.8; P=0.04), HbA1c &gt;/=9.5% (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.1; P&lt;0.01), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (OR 3.23; 95% CI 1.06 to 4.36; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our case-control study gives evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> is an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>NIDDM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
