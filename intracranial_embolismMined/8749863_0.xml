<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>True-to-scale elastic models of carotid artery were used in the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments were performed in three models with varying severity of roughness and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (physiological healthy) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The different degrees of roughness in the three models were created by melting graded holes in the wax cast used to make the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Velocity data were collected using 4 Mhz pulsed ultrasonic and single component laser Doppler velocimeters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The roughness resulted in modified velocity distribution, affecting to various extent ultrasonic Doppler spectral parameters, in particular the measure of symmetry of spectral distribution </plain></SENT>
