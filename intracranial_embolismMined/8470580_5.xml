<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the signal intensity of infarcted brain parenchyma on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images obtained within the first 3 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of signs and symptoms in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262004" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of 16 patients who had a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262004" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic cerebral infarction</z:e> (highly probable according to criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were obtained within 3 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two neuroradiologists who had no knowledge of the diagnoses reviewed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of these 16 patients and 20 control subjects in random order and evaluated signal-intensity changes in the gray and white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On proton density-weighted images, the central and cortical gray matter showed increased signal intensity in 63-69% and 88-94% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No abnormalities of the brain parenchyma were apparent on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images obtained within 3 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adjacent white matter appeared hyperintense on long TR images in only a few cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An increased signal intensity in the gray matter on proton density-weighted images was the most characteristic parenchymal change seen on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of the brain obtained within 3 hr after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262004" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
