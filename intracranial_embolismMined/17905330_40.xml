<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aims of the present study were to prospectively evaluate the incidence of early complications of pulmonary vein ablation for AF in an unselected population of consecutive patients, and to identify possible predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From April 2005 to October 2006, data from 1,011 consecutive patients who were undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation for every type of AF in 10 Italian centers were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> complications occurring from the admission of the patient up to the 30th day were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 40 patients (3.9%): 12 (1.2%) had peripheral vascular complications, 8 (0.8%) had conservatively treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo>, 6 (0.6%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> (successfully drained), 5 (0.5%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e>, 4 (0.4%) presented <z:mp ids='MP_0010438'>pulmonary vein stenosis</z:mp> &gt;50%, and 5 (0.5%) presented other isolated adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (odds ratio 5,603, 95% confidence interval 1,559 to 20,139, P &lt; .008) characterized patients who presented with hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early complications of pulmonary vein catheter ablation seem to be fewer than in the early years of AF ablation, but still occur in 3.9% of procedures </plain></SENT>
