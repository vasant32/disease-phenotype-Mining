<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, transcranial doppler ultrasonography was used to monitor the presence of air emboli in the middle cerebral arteries of 7 patients undergoing cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Doppler signals consistent with numerous air emboli were noted during each injection of radiographic contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was studied further in sheep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiographic contrast medium was injected into the carotid artery while a major carotid branch was insonated transorbitally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals similar to those seen in patients were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Air was introduced at two points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>First, at the time of drawing up the contrast into the syringe, especially with more viscous media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Standing the media before injection resulted in a highly significant reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>, reducing the total mean duration of emboli from 1.32 (SD 0.60) s after immediate injection to 0.04 (0.05) s after ten minutes standing for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31709">iohexol</z:chebi> 340 mg/mL (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Second, air was introduced at the time of injection, possibly by the formation of cavitation bubbles under pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This occurred most prominently with the less viscous contrast media and with saline, and was significantly reduced by slow injection (mean duration of emboli for saline 2.85 [2.43] s with fast injection compared with 0.32 [0.37] s with slow injection, p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>Air embolism</z:mpath> may contribute towards neurological dysfunction after angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Measures should be taken to reduce this by allowing contrast media to stand prior to injection, and by flushing catheters with saline injected slowly </plain></SENT>
