<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The 'lacunar hypothesis' has been challenged, since small (diameter &lt;15 mm) subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> can be produced by middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e> (MCAD) or cardioembolism (CE), while a larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> can occur without evidence of MCAD or CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess whether the lacunar hypothesis based on size is still valid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 118 patients who were admitted within 72 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> deep subcortical <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> detected by diffusion-weighted MRI, and who had undergone angiography (mostly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms were arbitrarily categorized regardless of lesion size: (1) MCAD when there was a corresponding <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesion; (2) internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> (ICAD) when there was a significant (&gt;50%) ipsilateral ICAD; (3) CE when there was emboligenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> without MCAD or ICAD, and (4) small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) when there was neither CE nor MCAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> was further divided into definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (dSVD, longest diameter &lt;15 mm) or probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (pSVD, longest diameter &gt; or =15 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-three patients (62%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, of which 38 (32%) had pSVD and 35 (30%) dSVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients (28%) had MCAD, five (4%) CE, and seven (6%) ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> diameter in MCAD was not larger than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (p = 0.35), and there was no difference in clinical features or risk factors between MCAD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, or between pSVD and dSVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CE was distinguished from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> by its larger size and cortical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are no clinical and lesion-size differences between MCAD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, suggesting that there seems to be no rationale for the 15 mm size criterion for lacunar or small-vessel infarction </plain></SENT>
