<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Territory of the middle cerebral artery in the lateral view of angiogram was divided into three regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Collateral circulation time was measured with the period from the maximum filling of carotid siphon to the retrograde maximum filling of collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With these studies, the following conclusions were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1) The degree of collateral circulation is classified into three types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One type with good collateral circulation is type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another type with moderate collateral circulation is type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A further type with poor collateral circulation is type III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiographic circulation time in each branch of the middle cerebral artery is measured in each type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2) There is a tendency that types with the better development of collateral circulation have the smaller low density area on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In type I, the smallest low density area on CT appears in the territory of basal ganglia or around <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In type II or III, the medium or large low density area on CT appears in cortical and/or subcortical territory of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>3) There is a tendency that types with the worse development of collateral circulation have the later collateral circulation time in each region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If collateral circulation time is later than 4 seconds, it is impossible to avoid the appearance of the low density area on CT in C region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the same way, in B region, it is later than 5 or 6 seconds, in A region, it is later than 7 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>But, in type II or III, there are a few cases in which it is impossible to avoid the appearance of the low density area on CT, even if collateral circulation time is earlier than those mentioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As mentioned above, classifying of collateral circulation is possible to expect the extent of the low density area on CT, and measurement of collateral circulation time is able to estimate the appearance of the low density area on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In type I and II, superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery anastomosis is apt to make the low density area narrow on CT, and to prevent the appearance of hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
