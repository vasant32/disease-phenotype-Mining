<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>Migraine</z:hpo> with visual aura is another paroxysmal disturbance in which a sudden dysfunction of cortical areas fed by the terminal branches of the basilar artery is believed to trigger the attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we investigated the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in a consecutive unselected cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in a consecutive unselected cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients to search for a possible mechanism for the reported association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 113 patients, consecutively referred by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Outpatient Clinic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> (MA+, mean age 34+/-12 years) were compared with 53 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002083'>migraine without aura</z:hpo> (MA-, mean age 36+/-13 years) and with 25 age-matched nonmigraine subjects (mean age 31+/-10 years) selected from the hospital staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was assessed with transcranial Doppler sonography with IV injection of agitated saline, a technique that is 90% sensitive and 100% specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was 48% (54/113) in MA+ patients, 23% (12/53) in MA- patients, and 20% (5/25) in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference between MA+ and MA- patients was significant (odds ratio [OR] = 3.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.41 to 7.04, chi2 = 9.52,p = 0.002) as was the difference between MA+ patients and controls (OR = 3.66, 95% CI = 1.21 to 13.25, chi2 = 6.46, p = 0.01), whereas MA- patients did not differ from controls (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.32 to 4.45, chi2 = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI was negative in 22 MA+ and 8 MA- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patency of the foramen ovale is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002083'>migraine without aura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> found in epidemiologic studies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> may be explained by an increased propensity to paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
