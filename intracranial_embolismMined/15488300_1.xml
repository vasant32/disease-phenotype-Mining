<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the hypothesis that craniectomy may also be beneficial in smaller <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction we evaluated the effects of craniectomy on infarction size in small thromboembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, thromboembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in 40 rats by endovascular injection of autologous, fibrin-rich emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one animals with a diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DWI)-derived infarction size of 50-100 mm3 (involving one- to two-third of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory) at 1 h after injection were randomly assigned to two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven animals of group 1 immediately underwent craniectomy, ten animals of group 2 (controls) were not treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial DWI was performed at 4 and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infarction size was assessed by TTC-staining at 48 h after emboli injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As result, prior to treatment, at 1 h after emboli injection, infarction size in groups 1 and 2 was 65.9 +/- 16.0 mm3 and 67.9 +/- 17.8 mm3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 4 and 24 h, infarction size in group 1 was 73.5 +/- 22.1 mm3 and 85.2 +/- 24.7 mm3, and 76.3 +/- 21.0 mm3 and 83.4 +/- 22.9 mm3 in group 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TTC-derived infarction size was 84.0 +/- 23.3 mm3 and 82.7 +/- 21.5 mm3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups (P &gt; 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that for small thromboembolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction early craniectomy is not beneficial </plain></SENT>
