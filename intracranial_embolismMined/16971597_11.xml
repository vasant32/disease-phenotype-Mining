<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intra-arterial therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> are increasingly available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous therapy (IV) followed immediately by intra-arterial therapy (IA) has been shown to be safe, but such therapy is resource intensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selecting the best patients for this therapy may be accomplished with the use of baseline neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from the IMS-1 and National Institute for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies to compare outcomes among IV-IA tPA, IV-tPA, and placebo treatment stratified by the baseline CT scan appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CT scans were scored using the Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT (ASPECT) score and dichotomized into ASPECT score &gt; 7 (favorable scan) and ASPECT score &lt; or = 7 (unfavorable scan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to assess for an ASPECT score by treatment interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 460 patients was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age and sex were similar among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IV-IA tPA cohort had a higher median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale (NIHSS) score (18 versus 17) compared with the IV tPA cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with favorable CT scans (ASPECT score &gt; 7) was lowest in the IV-IA tPA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A multiplicative interaction effect was shown indicating that patients with an ASPECT score &gt; 7 in the IV-IA cohort were more likely to have a good outcome compared with IV tPA and with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Harm may accrue to patients treated with IV-IA therapy who have an unfavorable baseline CT scan appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a favorable baseline CT scan appearance are the most likely to benefit from IV-IA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis will be tested in the IMS-3 study </plain></SENT>
