<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: Two and a half-year-old boy, suffering from early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, profound <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> had been diagnosed at an age of 1.5 years, which had been more severe on the right side initially, but had progressed to bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION AND COMPLICATION: Cochlear implantation on the left side, followed up by an extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo>, causing intracranial compression with a midline shift of 15 mm to the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This initial complication was followed up by arterial infarction not only of the middle but also the posterior as well as the anterior cerebral artery, most likely caused by incarceration through the tentorium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After immediate neurosurgical intervention and intensive care treatment including low-dose anticoagulation and high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, the child recuperated completely within 3 weeks without any remaining neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In cochlear implantation, especially if placement of the implant housing is associated with considerable bone work, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> has to be considered as an extremely rare, but life-threatening, complication </plain></SENT>
