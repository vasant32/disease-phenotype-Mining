<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> is a major cause of morbidity in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to evaluate the prevalence and the acoustic characteristics of microembolic signals in three groups of patients with different prosthetic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seventy-nine patients with prosthetic cardiac valves (85 Björk-Shiley, 56 Medtronic-Hall, and 38 Carpentier-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e>) and 25 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were examined using transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monitoring time was 30 minutes over the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence and numbers of embolic signals were significantly higher in patients with Björk-Shiley compared with those with Medtronic-Hall and Carpentier-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> valves (89% versus 50% and 53%, respectively; P &lt; .001, chi 2; 156 [112, 204] versus 2 [1, 4] and 2 [1, 4] signals/h, respectively; median [95% nonparametric confidence interval], both P &lt; .001, multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The signal intensity was significantly higher in patients with Björk-Shiley and Medtronic-Hall valves than patients with Carpentier-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> valves (2435 [2345, 2527] and 2120 [1745, 2483] versus 225 [184, 287] power units, median [95% confidence interval], both P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between embolic signal numbers and clinical parameters including history of neurological deficit, cardiac rhythm, duration of artificial valve, previous cardiac operations, or intensity of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals were not detected in any of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that the prevalence, quantity, and acoustic characteristics of Doppler embolic signals differ in patients having three different types of prosthetic heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no correlation with clinical parameters was identified </plain></SENT>
