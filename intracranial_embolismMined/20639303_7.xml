<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) on transcranial Doppler will be associated with carotid plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography (FDG PET) in recently symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen patients presenting with recent (47 Â± 31 days) anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 50% to 99% stenosis of the ipsilateral carotid bifurcation underwent FDG PET, high-resolution black-blood carotid MRI, and transcranial Doppler for detection of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with potential cardiac sources of emboli or contralateral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regions of interest defined on the coregistered MRI were used to measure FDG standardized uptake values (with Rousset partial volume correction) from the index and contralateral carotid plaques and artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 7 patients (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>+ group) and absent in 8 (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>- group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in index-to-contralateral plaque standardized uptake value ratio between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>+ (median, 1.05; first to third quartile, 0.96 to 1.32) and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>- (median, 0.76; first to third quartile, 0.62 to 0.94) patients (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interval from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to PET and percent index <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were not different between the 2 groups (P=0.68 and P=0.48, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of recently symptomatic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, an association was found between in vivo measures of plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> detected by FDG PET and the presence of transcranial Doppler <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings strengthen the notion that embolic events distal to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> are related to plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and FDG PET may be useful in the investigation of culprit carotid lesions </plain></SENT>
