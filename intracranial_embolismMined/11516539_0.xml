<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 1 MHz transducer for use with transcranial Doppler ultrasound may improve the intensity and therefore the detection of embolic signals (ES) and may also reduce the number of absent acoustic windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A series of studies was performed to investigate its potential benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Firstly, ES were detected using a 1 MHz and a 2 MHz transducer both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the time taken to identify 100 middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was recorded for both transducers and the best Doppler signal obtained was reviewed off-line and graded for quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ES were more intense when detected with the 1 MHz compared with the 2 MHz transducer, both in vitro (p &lt;.0001) and in vivo (p &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 100 MCAs studied, 81 had acoustic windows identified with both transducers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of acoustic windows detected with one transducer but not the other was the same for both transducers (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time taken to identify the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was longer with the 1 MHz transducer (p &lt;.0001) and the quality of the signal achieved was poorer (p &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the 1 MHz transducer improved embolic signal intensity but the overall quality of the flow spectrum obtained was poorer with the 1 MHz than with the 2 MHz transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A lower frequency transducer of 1 MHz or possibly 1.5 MHz with transcranial Doppler ultrasound may improve the application of embolic signal detection but may not improve the signal for routine measurement of flow velocities </plain></SENT>
