<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hundred thirty-nine patients permanently paced (135 AAI, 79 DDD, 125 VVI) because of SSS were followed for a mean period of 5 years (range 2 to 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 4 groups according to age (less than 70 or greater than 70 years) and the presence or absence of an associated conduction disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight percent of VVI, 55% of AAI and 40.5% of <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> patients were greater than 70 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the VVI and <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> groups a conduction disturbance was present in 67 of 204 (33%) patients; conduction disturbances were more common in patients greater than 70 years old (46 of 111, 41%) than in those less than 70 years old (21 of 93,22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264907" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wenckebach</z:e> threshold (greater than 140 beats/min) remained unchanged during the follow-up period in 82% of AAI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 9% of these patients, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264907" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wenckebach</z:e> threshold showed some degree of deterioration, but only in 2 patients was it less than 100 beats/min (1.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011706'>second-degree atrioventricular block</z:hpo> was observed in 7 patients (5%); it disappeared in 6 of these patients when drug therapy was discontinued.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
