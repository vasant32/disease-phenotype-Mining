<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, distal embolic events remain a problem with this procedure compared to results with established carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To counteract such problems, various blocking balloon system such as a simple distal blocking balloon system or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> catching system have been used in some instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This time, a double-balloon system was used as a proximal blocking system during predilation, and an existing distal blocking system was used during practical carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These systems were applied to six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we used a modified conventional blood transfusion system for filtration and retrieval of the aspirated blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the simple distal blocking balloon system, occurrence of distal emboli could be reduced with our new combined method although the number of cases is too small to reach any definite conclusions </plain></SENT>
