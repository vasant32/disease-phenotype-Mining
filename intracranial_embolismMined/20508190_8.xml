<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Watershed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is a significant cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e>, but its pathophysiology is unsettled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although hemodynamic compromise has long been regarded as the main mechanism-particularly with deep watershed infarction-there is some contradictory evidence from clinical and pathological studies for a role of microembolism, thought to result from plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no study so far has directly addressed these conflicting scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 16 consecutive patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>/minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and ipsilateral 50% to 99% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, we prospectively obtained (1) plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> mapping with (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography; (2) brain MRI and perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>; and (3) transcranial Doppler detection of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded if on dual antiplatelets or with a potential cardiac source of emboli or contralateral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found the expected significant relationship between (1) degree of stenosis and severity of distal hemodynamic impairment in the watershed areas; and (2) degree of in vivo plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and rate of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>/hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deep watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were present in 8 patients and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in 8 (3 with both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no systematic association between the presence of deep watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and either hemodynamic impairment or <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, but deep watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were present only when either hemodynamic impairment or <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was present (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study supports the idea that in symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e>, deep watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> result either from hemodynamic impairment secondary to severe lumen stenosis or from microembolism secondary to plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no direct evidence that both mechanisms act in synergy </plain></SENT>
