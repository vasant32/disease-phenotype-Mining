<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated neurological and functional outcome after early treatment with HBO additional to tPA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced using an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in 87 male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomized to therapy with tPA+HBO, tPA alone, or control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Menzies score, Beam walk, and the Corner test were assessed for a period of 4 weeks following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the first 24 h neurological deficits improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups but most pronounced in animals treated with tPA+HBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, a deterioration of neurological deficits occurred in the tPA+HBO group with significant differences at day 7, 8, 18, and 24 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, Beam walk and Corner test results did not differ significantly between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This first report of early simultaneous treatment with tPA and HBO in experimental embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with 4-week follow-up confirms previous studies reporting positive effects of HBO shortly after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, combined tPA and HBO resulted in deterioration of neurological deficits without affecting functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies should focus on interactions of tPA and HBO on molecular level leading to delayed damage to brain tissue at risk </plain></SENT>
