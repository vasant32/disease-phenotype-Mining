<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, explicit memory performance was examined in a 40-year-old male (RG) with bilateral anterior and medial thalamic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standardized tests indicated that the patient exhibited more severe recall than recognition deficits and his performance was generally worse for verbal compared to nonverbal memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recognition memory tests using the remember-know (R/K) procedure and the confidence-based receiver operating characteristic (ROC) procedure were used to examine recollection- and familiarity-based recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These tests revealed that RG had deficits in recollection and smaller, but consistent deficits in familiarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results are in agreement with models indicating that the anteromedial thalamus is important for both recollection- and familiarity-based recognition memory </plain></SENT>
