<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had died, 14 of them suddenly, two from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, two from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, and three from noncardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Life table analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> was significantly associated with young age less than 20 years (relative risk [rr] = 8.63, when compared with those greater than 40 years) and with positive Master's single two-step test (rr = 3.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> was more frequent in patients with positive Master's single test (rr = 4.27) and with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 20 mm Hg (rr = 2.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, observed in 15 patients, was a poor prognostic sign, resulting in five cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, prognosis was favorable in patients with apical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> with giant negative T wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> showed a prognosis consistent with Western patients, except for excellent outcome of apical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
