<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, appropriate and relevant animal models must be selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the only approved treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is that of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) the models selected should be amenable to thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore describe a new model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the rat in which a fibrin rich clot is placed via the internal carotid artery (ICA) at the origin of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data are summarized describing treatment of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with rtPA administered at various times after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the use of combination antiadhesion molecule and rtPA therapy, and the application of MRI to monitor the temporal evolution of physiological changes within ischemic tissue with and without rtPA intervention and to predict therapeutic efficacy </plain></SENT>
