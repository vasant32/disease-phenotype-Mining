<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The multicenter ARMOUR (ProximAl PRotection with the MO.MA Device DUring CaRotid Stenting) trial evaluated the 30-day safety and effectiveness of the MO.MA Proximal Cerebral Protection Device (Invatec, Roncadelle, Italy) utilized to treat high surgical risk patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Background: Distal embolic protection devices (EPD) have been traditionally utilized during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MO.MA device acts as a balloon occlusion "endovascular clamping" system to achieve cerebral protection prior to crossing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective registry enrolled 262 subjects, 37 roll-in and 225 pivotal subjects evaluated with intention to treat (ITT) from September 2007 to February 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent CAS using the MO.MA device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through 30 days (30-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events [MACCE]) was compared to a performance goal of 13% derived from trials utilizing distal EPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the ITT population, the mean age was 74.7 years with 66.7% of the cohort being male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients comprised 15.1% and 28.9% were octogenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Device success was 98.2% and procedural success was 93.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 30-day MACCE rate was 2.7% [95% CI (1.0-5.8%)] with a 30-day major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of 0.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No symptomatic patient suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during this trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ARMOUR trial demonstrated that the MO.MA(R) Proximal Cerebral Protection Device is safe and effective for high surgical risk patients undergoing CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in symptomatic patients is the lowest rate reported in any independently adjudicated prospective multicenter registry trial to date </plain></SENT>
