<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These altered neurologic outcomes have a significant impact on patients and their quality of life postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perioperative events, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and decrease in cerebral oxygenation and hypoperfusion have been identified as factors causal in producing adverse neurologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More importantly, a number of mechanisms related to operative techniques have been found to cause these adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identifying practices associated with adverse outcomes and implementing practice changes may benefit clinical outcomes for cardiac surgery patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standardizing techniques among clinicians will also achieve continuous quality improvement in the process of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Optimal intra-operative management systems contribute significantly to ensuring good patient outcomes (i.e., avoiding neurological injury in patients which is an important cause of post-operative morbidity and mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Groom and colleagues (2004) have developed a system to obtain a thorough understanding and redesign of the process of care associated with cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They have developed a system that simultaneously measures some embolic activity, cerebral oxygen saturation, and physiologic parameters, as well as uses a video recording device during cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To date, the evaluation of this methodology in a rigorous, prospective manner has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to conduct a randomised clinical trial to evaluate the influence of continuous quality improvement in cardiac surgery using biofeedback (i.e., real time information on physiologic functioning from an integrated monitoring system) to reduce the incidence of potentially adverse events during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By achieving the outcomes of this project, we plan to be able to not only introduce change in our own practice, but provide a framework for other units to introduce change </plain></SENT>
