<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mechanical aortic valves are a possible source of microemboli potentially causing cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the long-term impact of mechanical aortic valve replacement on neurocognitive function is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective, contemporary study, we followed 32 consecutive patients (aged 51 +/- 8 years; range, 38 to 70; EuroSCORE [European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation] 4.4 +/- 1.7) undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cohort of age- and sex-matched patients (n = 28, aged 50 +/- 7 years) served as nonsurgical controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After aortic valve replacement, neurocognitive function was serially reevaluated at 7-day (n = 32), 4-month (n = 31), and 3-year (n = 29) follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitive function was measured by means of P300 auditory evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before the operation, P300 peak latencies were comparable between surgical patients (361 +/- 32 ms) and nonsurgical controls (365 +/- 33 ms, p = 0.783) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, P300 peak latencies were prolonged 7 days after surgery (380 +/- 32 ms) as compared with before the operation (361 +/- 32 ms, p &lt; 0.0001) and as compared with nonsurgical controls (364 +/- 34 ms, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 4-month (369 +/- 30 ms, p = 0.752) and 3-year (370 +/- 31 ms, p = 0.825) follow-up, P300 peak latencies normalized as compared with before operation and as compared with nonsurgical controls (4-month follow-up 363 +/- 31 ms, p = 0.832; 3-year follow-up 366 +/- 32 ms, p = 0.432) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found no difference in patients with different valve types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite previous assumptions based on the potential occurrence of microemboli in patients with mechanical valves, mechanical aortic valve replacement has no adverse long-term impact on neurocognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding is only valid for patients with a comparable age range undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
