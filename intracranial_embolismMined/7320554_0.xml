<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The echocardiographic study was performed in 13 cases with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> including one case with annular subvalvular left ventricular (LV) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The echocardiographic findings were compared with clinical as well as anatomical findings obtained by surgery or autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The valvular vegetations were visualized echocardiographically in 6 cases (46%); 2 cases in aortic valve (AV), 2 in mitral valve (MV) and 2 in both valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 3 out of 4 cases with AV vegetation, the abnormal echo was seen in the LV outflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two out of these 3 cases indicated "flail aortic leaflet" with early closure of the MV, and immediate aortic valve replacement was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, one died 4 weeks after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The echocardiographic findings showed good correlation with anatomical findings in 4 cases with valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Out of 4 cases with MV vegetation, one developed the progressive growth with subsequent rupture of the chordae tendinae to the anterior mitral leaflet, which paralleled to the clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In another one case, the echocardiographic size of vegetation in the MV reduced significantly shortly after the episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a case of annular subvalvular LV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> possibly due to infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, echo free space was visualized in the interventricular septum, coinciding well with postmortem anatomical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It seemed to be reasonable to indicate surgical repair in cases with evident vegetation and considerable destruction of AV, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> inevitably develops and the prognosis is poor </plain></SENT>
