<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Historically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1319200" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">postoperative cognitive dysfunction</z:e> has been attributed to different factors, including anesthesia, but the influence of the surgery has not been thoroughly examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We conducted a prospective, controlled clinical trial to assess intraoperative cerebral microembolization during THA and neuropsychologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) also was investigated, using transcranial Doppler, to determine whether this affected cerebral microembolic incidence and load and whether microemboli occurred as a result of specific surgical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients were recruited who underwent THA and neuropsychologic assessment; a battery of tests was administered preoperatively and at 6 weeks and 6 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, patients showed improvement in total neuropsychologic change scores at both postoperative intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cerebral microembolization for THA was 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> did not appear to influence microemboli load or incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More microemboli were seen during femoral component insertion and impaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative cerebral microembolization occurs in a substantial proportion of patients during THA recorded by transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The microemboli load is low and is not influenced by the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Certain surgical activities seem responsible for greater cerebral microemboli generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, neuropsychologic outcome was not affected postoperatively by microemboli or other operative or patient variables </plain></SENT>
