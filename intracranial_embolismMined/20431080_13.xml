<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence of retrograde flow from complex plaques (&gt; or =4-mm-thick, ulcerated, or superimposed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>) of the descending aorta (DAo) and its potential role in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-four consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with aortic plaques &gt; or =3-mm-thick in transesophageal echocardiography were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed to localize complex plaques and to measure time-resolved 3-dimensional blood flow within the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional visualization was used to evaluate if diastolic retrograde flow connected plaque location with the outlet of the left subclavian artery, left common carotid artery, or brachiocephalic trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complex DAo plaques were considered an embolic source if retrograde flow reached a supra-aortic vessel that supplied the territory of visible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and embolic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only decreasing heart rate was correlated (P&lt;0.02) with increasing flow reversal to the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retrograde flow from complex DAo plaques reached the left subclavian artery in 55 (58.5%), the left common carotid artery in 23 (24.5%), and the brachiocephalic trunk in 13 patients (13.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on routine diagnostics and MRI of the ascending aorta/aortic arch, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology was determined in 57 and cryptogenic in 37 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Potential embolization from DAo plaques was then identified in 19 of 57 patients (33.3%) with determined and in 9 of 37 patients (24.3%) with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde flow from complex DAo plaques was frequent in both determined and cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and could explain embolism to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that complex DAo plaques should be considered a new source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
