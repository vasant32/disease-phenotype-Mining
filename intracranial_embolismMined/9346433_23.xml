<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An additional three non-embolized C57BL/6J mice were used as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>Embolus</z:mpath> induction, cerebral vascular perfusion deficit, and consequent ischemic cell damage were confirmed by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, laser confocal microscopy, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduction in rCBF and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were not detected in the control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> C57BL/6J and B6C3 mice at 24 hours after injection of a clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF in the ipsilateral parietal cortex decreased to 23% (P &lt; 0.05) and 17% (P &lt; 0.05) of preembolization levels immediately and persisted for at least 1 hour in C57BL/6J mice (n = 6) and in B6C3 mice (n = 3), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease of rCBF was accompanied by a corresponding reduction of plasma perfusion in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurons exhibited marked reduction in microtubule-associated protein-2 immunostaining coincident with the area of perfusion deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 30.3% +/- 13.4% for C57BL/6J mice (n = 17), and 38.3% +/- 15.3% for B6C3 mice (n = 7) at 24 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This model of embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is relevant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> in humans and may be useful to investigate embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the genetically altered mouse and for evaluation of antiembolic therapies </plain></SENT>
