<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study sought to analyze the total number of cerebral ischemic complications with interventional <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> patients (15 male, 26-71 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> proven by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were examined by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) before and after <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the MRI examinations following the intervention, new microembolic lesions were found in three of 35 (8.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesions were located in the right and left thalamus and the left frontoparietal white matter respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were clinically inapparent, whereas the third patient suffered from a transient right-sided hemihypaesthesia for 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the prevention of recurrent cerebrovascular events associated with the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> is necessary, a low frequency of closure associated silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> was documented after interventional <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of microembolic events with neurological deficit was 1/35 (approximately 2.8%) </plain></SENT>
