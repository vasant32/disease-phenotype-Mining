<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (SEC) in the descending thoracic aorta and plasma levels of hemostatic markers in patients with nonrheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTINGS: A cross-sectional study at a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: In 91 consecutive patients (mean +/- SE age, 70 +/- 1 years; 68 men) with nonrheumatic AF who underwent transesophageal echocardiography, plasma levels of markers for platelet activity (platelet factor 4 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">[PF4]</z:chebi> and beta-thromboglobulin [beta-TG]), thrombotic status (thrombin-antithrombin III complex [TAT]), and fibrinolytic status (D-dimer and plasmin-alpha(2)-plasmin inhibitor complex [PIC]) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-three patients who had aortic SEC (AoSEC) were older (72 years vs 68 years; p &lt; 0.05) and had a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF (88% vs 52%; p &lt; 0.05) than 48 patients without AoSEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TAT, PIC, and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with AoSEC than in those without AoSEC, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> and beta-TG levels were not different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> did not differ between the two groups (23% vs 29%), the prevalence of peripheral embolism was higher in patients with AoSEC than in those without AoSEC (10% vs 0%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 7.53; p &lt; 0.02), SEC in the left atrium (odds ratio, 2.14; p &lt; 0.02), and aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 1.87; p &lt; 0.04) emerged as independent predictors of AoSEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with nonrheumatic AF who have AoSEC appear to have enhanced coagulation activity but not platelet activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intensive anticoagulation treatment might be required for these patients </plain></SENT>
