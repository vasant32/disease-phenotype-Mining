<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This device was used as mechanical support of the failing heart in nine patients intended for heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> an orthotopic TAH was implanted; one survived despite severe preoperative ischemic liver damage, and the other died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In seven patients an atrio-aortic LVAD was implanted; six had suffered an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> with cardiogenic shock, and one could not be weaned off bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These included one 65-year-old with incipient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> at operation, and a 40-year-old with preoperative liver and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1565489" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney insufficiency</z:e> who was transplanted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this patient the septic focus, natural and artificial heart, were removed at transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one we were unable to establish satisfactory circulation, one died after failure of the transplanted heart, one suffered a lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and one developed multi-organ failure after repeated attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the Vienna heart sufficient circulatory support could be established with cardiac outputs between 6 and 8 l/min for the TAH and 3.5 to 4.5 l/min for the LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With this type of support an overall survival rate of 44% could be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mechanical <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> was not a clinical problem and no device failure occurred </plain></SENT>
