<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used transcranial Doppler (TCD) to monitor microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) and Doppler ultrasound to classify types and density of plaques in 27 patients with restenosis after CEA and in 97 patients with primary stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean period between surgery and examination in patients with restenosis was 36.7+/-30.5 months (range 12-96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups were similar in distribution of main vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 36 (37.1%) patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> on TCD in primary stenosis versus 11 (40.7%) in restenosis group (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An average number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in primary stenosis group was 2.9+/-3.5/30 min and in restenosis group -3.4+/-2.9 (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in distribution of plaques by echogenicity as well as by density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment by age, sex, and main risk factors, no influence was found for the effect of stenosis or restenosis on either the presence or the amount of emboli, as well as on the ultrasonic character of plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid plaques in patients with severe unilateral carotid restenosis at least 1 year after surgery and in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesions</z:e> are similar in their embolic potential and ultrasonic characteristics </plain></SENT>
