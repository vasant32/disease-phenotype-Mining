<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ulcerated plaques in the aortic arch are frequent autopsy findings in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e>, particularly those of unknown cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that they could be a source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using transesophageal echocardiography, we prospectively studied 12 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of undetermined cause after noninvasive workup to evaluate the frequency of aortic plaques or mural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> that could embolize in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Six patients (50%) had an intraluminal echogenic mass of the aortic arch, mainly located at the junction of the ascending aorta and arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This material was pedunculated (in one patient) or broad based (in five patients) with a markedly irregular surface and intraluminal extension from 3 to 15 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found cholesterol emboli in two of the four patients who underwent quadriceps biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that transesophageal echocardiography has capabilities in detecting such lesions and point to the aortic arch as a possible source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of unknown cause </plain></SENT>
