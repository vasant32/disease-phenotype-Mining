<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of 10 patients (mean age 68 years) undergoing transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ICA stenoses were greater that 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had an ipsilateral hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (3) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (4), two patients had a contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and one patient was asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine procedures were done under local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protection was established through a cervical common carotid (CCA) cutdown to create an external <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> between the ICA and the internal jugular vein with temporally CCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Venous oxygen saturation (SVO(2)) was continuously monitored through a catheter placed in the distal internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mental status and motor-sensory changes were categorized and assessed throughout and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were technically successful without significant residual stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean ICA flow reversal time was 22 minutes (range, 15 to 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion produced a slight (SVO(2) = 72.6%+/-9.4) but significant decrease (P =.012) in SVO(2), compared with baseline (SVO(2) = 77% +/-10.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During ICA flow reversal (SVO(2) = 72.4% +/-10.1) cerebral oxygen saturation did not change compared with CCA occlusion alone (P =.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transient balloon occlusion during angioplasty of the ICA (SVO(2) = 64.6%+/-12.9) produced a significant decrease in cerebral SVO(2) compared with CCA occlusion (P =.015) and compared with CCA occlusion with ICA flow reversal (P =.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No mental status changes or ipsilateral hemispheric focal symptoms occurred during CCA occlusion with ICA flow reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient with contralateral ICA occlusion sustained brief upper extremity <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> related to the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five patients sustained a vasovagal response during balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, four did not require treatment, and one had <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> requiring <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Mean SVO(2) saturation was not different in these five patients compared with the five who did not sustain a vasovagal response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or neurologic deficits occurred within 30 days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting with ICA flow reversal is well tolerated in the awake patient, even in the presence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Cerebral oxygenation during ICA flow reversal is comparable to that during CCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>ICA angioplasty balloon inflation produces a decrease in cerebral SVO(2) significantly greater than that occurring during ICA flow reversal </plain></SENT>
