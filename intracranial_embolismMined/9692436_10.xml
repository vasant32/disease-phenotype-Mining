<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to confirm earlier findings that retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) can improve cerebral outcome after prolonged hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>), and to determine whether RCP with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inferior vena caval occlusion</z:e>, which is more effective in removing particulate emboli, is superior to conventional RCP in enhancing cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-two pigs (27 to 30 kg) were randomly assigned to undergo one of the following for 90 minutes at 20 degrees C: antegrade cerebral perfusion (<z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>); conventional RCP (RCP); RCP with occlusion of the inferior vena cava (RCP-O), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> with the head packed in ice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RCP flow was regulated to a sagittal sinus pressure of 20 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic, electrophysiologic, and metabolic monitoring were carried out until 4 hours after rewarming, daily behavioral and neurologic assessments until elective sacrifice on day 7, and histologic analysis of the brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete behavioral recovery was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surviving animals by day 5 after <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> or RCP, but in only 83% after RCP-O and 50% after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A histopathologic score of 2 or more, indicating more than mild injury, was not found in any animal after <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>, in 27% after RCP, in 47% after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>, and in 68% after RCP-O (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median oxygen consumption was 6.66 mL/min after <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>, 1.37 mL/min with RCP, and 1.02 mL/min with RCP-O (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median amount of fluid sequestered was 2,450 mL after RCP-O, 760 mL after RCP, and -200 mL after <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Conventional RCP without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inferior vena caval occlusion</z:e> results in a significantly better outcome than RCP-O after prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>, despite more efficient cerebral perfusion during RCP-O, and also provides cerebral protection superior to prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> alone, but care must be taken during its implementation to minimize <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and other possible causes of retroperfusion-related cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
