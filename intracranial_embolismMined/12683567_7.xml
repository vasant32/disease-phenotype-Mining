<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Atheroembolism</z:e> is a recognized complication of cardiac surgery, but its incidence and various outcomes have not been completely described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study was undertaken to better characterize the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of 49,377 autopsies and surgical specimens from the Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1973 and 1995 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three hundred twenty-seven patients (0.7%) had an identifiable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e> on histologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 29 (0.2%) had undergone a cardiac surgical procedure within 30 days of autopsy or surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient charts and pathology specimens were reviewed for operative findings, postoperative outcomes, and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of the 29 patients (21%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e> to the heart, 7 patients (24%) had embolism to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, 19 patients (66%) had embolism to the gastrointestinal tract, 14 patients (48%) had embolism to one or both kidneys, and 5 patients (17%) had embolism to a lower extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (55%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e> in two or more areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients (21%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was directly attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e>, including intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264686" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary embolism</z:e> (n = 3), massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 2), and extensive gastrointestinal embolization (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Atheroembolism</z:e> in cardiac surgery has a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, including devastating injuries and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the true incidence is probably underestimated in this retrospective study, the high attendant mortality and morbidity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e> have been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvements in outcome are likely to be associated with preoperative identification of patients at high risk, modifications of perfusion technique, and interventions to minimize secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and progressive organ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
