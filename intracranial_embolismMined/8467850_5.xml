<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to consider the prognostic value of hyperdensity of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), we studied retrospectively the medical records of 80 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who underwent a non-enhanced computed tomography no longer than 24 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the mortality and disability, a follow-up of 30 days was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mortality does not differ significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with and without increased density of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When disability, calculated with the Rankin scale, is considered, the two groups are different since patients with hyperdensity of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) have a significantly worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two groups do not differ for age, sex, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, and these factors do not influence the prognosis being equally present in the dead and in the survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate discriminant analysis with stepwise variable selection, the dense <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign was significantly correlated either to mortality or to disability, along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, age and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the dense <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> sign can be a useful prognostic factor in the early phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
