To test the validity of these criteria, we analyzed the symptoms at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 193 patients hospitalized after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to identification of a cardiac SOE (106 patients), an arterial SOE (38 patients), or no SOE (49 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cross-tabulations demonstrated that only rapidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were associated with the presence of a cardiac SOE to a significant degree </plain></SENT>
