<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale to study the degree and time course of recovery in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who were treated with conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We serially assessed 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who presented within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major neurological improvement was defined as a decrease in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> score by 4 points or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> score for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients improved significantly by 7 to 10 days and at last follow-up (average, 44 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major neurological improvement was seen in 5 of 41 patients (12%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2% to 22%) by 24 hours, 11 of 40 patients (28%; 95% CI, 14% to 41%) by 48 hours, and 19 of 37 patients (51%; 95% CI, 35% to 67%) by follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subgroup of patients with middle cerebral artery territory embolism showed a similar pattern of improvement; in contrast, patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> did not show significant change in scores during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The score on admission did not correlate with the degree of subsequent improvement or deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant percentage of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treated with conventional therapy show early improvement as assessed by the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The degree and time course of recovery may be influenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
