<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 98 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> was present with or without incompetence and in 24 the dominant or sole lesion was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral incompetence</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other valves, particularly the tricuspid, were also frequently affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disability was severe or total in almost every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and five patients were discharged from hospital, and in 90 per cent of these the clinical improvement was most gratifying, with the disappearance of pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PND">paroxysmal dyspnoea</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, and congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Return to full <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activity including physical work was the rule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality was 14 per cent and a further 38 per cent died during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major post-operative complication was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> which could occur at any time after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most important factor influencing the frequency of this complication was the nature of the valve seat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A bare steel seat was associated with a 100 per cent embolism, and a significant reduction occurred when a cloth-covered seat of Dacron-velour was introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy appeared to prevent large or fresh clots but had no effect on the deposition of fibrin or platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The only other factor of importance was the age of the patient: after the age of 50 life expectancy and trouble-free long-term survival was reduced </plain></SENT>
