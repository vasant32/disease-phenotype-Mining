<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: This technical note describes a complication related to the use of the Merci embolectomy device not previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The device can induce critical flow limitation within an accessed vessel because of a combination of vasospasm and anatomic conformational changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this can limit the safe removal of the device from intracranial vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a novel rescue technique that can be used to safely retrieve the entrapped Merci device without inciting localized vessel injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old male with embolic occlusion of the distal basilar artery and dissection-related occlusion of the left cervical vertebral underwent mechanical thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow-limiting vasospasm and/or anatomic conformational changes/ telescoping of the intracranial right vertebral artery segment was induced during deployment with subsequent entrapment of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reclamation of the entrapped device was performed by initially removing the Merci microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The entrapped and fixated device was then resheathed into a 4F slip catheter within the intracranial vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Merci device and the slip catheter were then removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Right vertebral and proximal basilar artery flow was reestablished after removal of the Merci device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Successful clot extraction was thereafter performed using a microsnare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In vitro assessment of the device has demonstrated its propensity to induce vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In vivo entrapment of the device has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Successful retrieval can be achieved if the Merci device becomes entrapped and fixated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This may be an important consideration as increased utilization of the device occurs </plain></SENT>
