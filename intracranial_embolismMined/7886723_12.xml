<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To facilitate reproducible and rigorous study of a tissue zone at risk of encroaching ischemic damage, we propose a new model in which the potentially compromised tissue lies within rather than perifocal to an ischemic locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The perimeter of the "zone at risk" is defined by a photothrombotically produced cortical lesion in the shape of a toroid (or "ring") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The exposed crania of erythrosin B-injected rats were irradiated with a 514.5-nm laser beam, configured as a 5-mm-diameter ring, to yield a ring-shaped lesion caused by photochemically induced platelet occlusion of cortical vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Developing perfusion deficits in the interior region were revealed by carbon black infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue damage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed by light and electron microscopy, and blood-brain barrier integrity was assessed with Evans blue dye and horseradish peroxidase as tracers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For rats injected with 17 mg/kg erythrosin B and irradiated for 2 minutes with a ring beam intensity of 0.92 W/cm2 (beam power of 65 mW), carbon black infusion at times up to 4 hours demonstrated a shallow cortical ring lesion encircling a fully patent zone at risk, which by 24 hours evinced an essentially complete perfusion deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At times up to 24 hours, the ring lesion was penetrated at the pial surface by distal branches of the middle cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stereotaxically based histopathological assessment showed that by 24 hours the lesion spanned the cortical thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume increased from 14.5 +/- 8.0 mm3 (mean +/- SD) (n = 8) to 46.2 +/- 15.6 mm3 (n = 8) between 4 and 24 hours after irradiation (P &lt; .01), but the anteroposterior lesion diameter did not change significantly between 4 hours (6.00 +/- 1.03 mm; n = 9) and 24 hours (6.75 +/- 1.15 mm; n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present model of slowly developing but inevitable cortical tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a sequestered area should facilitate more precise observations of the evolution of tissue metabolic responses, from the impending <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to the threshold of irreversible damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This system may prove efficient for evaluating treatments intended to salvage a penumbral region </plain></SENT>
