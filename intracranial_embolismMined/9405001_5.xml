<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 37 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (n=16, mean age 65.3+/-6.6 years) or paroxysmal (n=21, mean age 58.3+/-9.5 years) NRAF and an equal number of control subjects in sinus rhythm, who were matched for age, education and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive neuropsychological battery including tests of attention, memory, language and visuospatial skills was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> NRAF showed significantly poorer performances in tasks exploring attention and verbal memory functions, while the paroxysmal group was significantly impaired in a long-term memory task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological findings were confirmed excluding from both groups patients with CT evidence of cerebrovascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A small subgroup of patients was also submitted to cerebral MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neurologically asymptomatic NRAF is related to a subclinical but significant impairment in attention and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These deficits could be produced by minor ischemic lesions due to microembolization, or by diffuse hypoxic damage due to hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
