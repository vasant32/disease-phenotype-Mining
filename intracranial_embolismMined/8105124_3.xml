<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine hundred microspheres (48 microns) were injected into the right internal carotid artery of rats, and the time course of changes in the triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC)-stained areas of their brain slices and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and amino acid contents in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus of both hemispheres were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TTC-unstained area, a measure of infarction, was developed in the right hemisphere by the 3rd day after the embolism, which was similar to that on the 28th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A marked decline in <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> content of these three regions of the right hemisphere was detected throughout the experiment (28 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> levels were markedly decreased following microsphere-embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of these decreases were significantly attenuated during the first 5 days following the embolism, and they then partially recovered with time after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor metabolic changes were observed in the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that microsphere-embolism induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and/or sustained damage to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and neurotransmitter amino acid synthesis and/or catabolism of the brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model may provide information concerning the pathophysiological alterations in long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and infarction </plain></SENT>
