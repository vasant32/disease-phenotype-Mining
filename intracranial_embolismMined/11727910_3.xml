<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the most common reasons that left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumors</z:e> come to clinical attention is embolization to the systemic circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present two children who suffered left coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> due to embolization of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> of the mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 6-year-old female who had been admitted to the hospital after cerebrovascular embolization of a fragment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> of the mitral valve experienced sudden cardiovascular collapse due to occlusion of the left coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and underwent coronary embolectomy and resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> from the mitral valve and its tendinous cords </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular function did not improve, and she underwent orthotopic heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On follow-up 32 months after transplant, the patient is well, with no evidence of recurrence of or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> arose from the leaflets and tendinous cords of the mitral valve, and was composed grossly of multiple white nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic evaluation disclosed fragments composed predominantly of peripheral spindle cells in an extensive fibromyxoid stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mildly pleomorphic cells of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> gradually blended with adjacent pieces of the mitral valvar leaflet and tendinous cords </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies revealed strong staining for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi>, suggesting myogenic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The other patient was a 2 1/2-year-old female who died suddenly at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Grossly and histologically, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was essentially identical to the first case, and there was a 3 cm string-like extension passing into the orifice of the left coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To put the cases in context, we compare them with other descriptions of this rare type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
