<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aspirin treatment is recognized as an advantageous adjunct to thrombolytic agents in myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the effects of aspirin on the rate of clot lysis and on the frequency and extent of hemorrhagic transformations in rabbit models of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbit models of ex vivo platelet aggregation and cutaneous template <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times were used to show the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effects of aspirin in our experimental paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We monitored tissue-type plasminogen activator (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>)-induced clot lysis in two rabbit models of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by (1) scintigraphically following the dissolution of a 99mTc-tagged clot or (2) using roentgenography to follow the disappearance of an Sn-tagged clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In animals pretreated (18 hours) with a single administration of aspirin (1, 5, or 20 mg/kg IV) or 1 mg/kg per day for 3 days, the aggregation response of platelets to collagen (3.3 micrograms/mL) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (0.5 mmol/L) was attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-dose aspirin also increased ear template <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time from 1.6 to 2.6 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When aspirin (20 mg/kg) was administered 18 hours before embolism and subsequent lysis with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> (0.3 mg/kg bolus; 3 mg/kg per hour IV), the pretreatment significantly antagonized the rate and extent of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-induced clot lysis by up to 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed in a second embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The suppression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-induced lysis was reversed by administration of the prostacyclin analogue iloprost (10 micrograms/kg per hour) directly into the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that aspirin reduces the effects of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This effect may be the result of a loss of endothelial prostacyclin production since the effect is reversed by iloprost </plain></SENT>
