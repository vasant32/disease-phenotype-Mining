<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After prospective c-TCD for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, we compared clinical backgrounds between patients with positive and negative results for RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After counting microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>), RLS were functionally graded as follows (grade 0 = 0 MES, grade I = 1-10 MES, grade II = 11-30 MES, grade III = 31-100 MES if countable, grade IV = over 100 MES or uncountable like a shower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects comprised 584 patients (203 men, 381 women) with a mean age of 67.9 +/- 11.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RLS was detected in 134 of 584 patients (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, mean BMI was 22.1 in patients with RLS and 23.3 in those without RLS (P= .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean BMI in concordance with RLS grade gradually decreased (grade 0; 22.7, grade I; 20.8, grade II; 20.1, grade III; 19.6, P= .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After performing the Valsalva maneuver, mean BMI in concordance with RLS grade linearly increased (grade I; 20.6, grade II; 23.2, grade III; 24.8, grade IV; 25.8, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although smaller body size may be associated with detection of RLS, a patient with significant RLS (grade III or IV) had larger body </plain></SENT>
