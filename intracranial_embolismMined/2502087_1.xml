<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between January, 1984 and June, 1987, this operation was performed in 51 patients (39 men, 12 women; mean age 58 +/- 10.9 years) presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo>; 25 were in class III and 14 in class IV of the NYHA classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients died soon after the operation and 2 others some time later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 47 survivors were followed up for a mean period of 20.5 +/- 11.2 months: 3 of them required mitral valve replacement for residual MVR or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo>, one developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the latest control, 18 patients were in NYHA class I and 26 in NYHA class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Doppler velocimetry showed no or little mitral valve dysfunction; the residual MVR was below grade 1 in 37 of the 44 survivors who were not reoperated upon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mitral function was satisfactory after Carpentier valvuloplasty, with a mean transmitral gradient of 3.3 +/- 1.3 mmHg and a mean mitral valve area of 2.9 +/- 0.98 cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients an intraventricular gradient of 10 to 20 mmHg, reflecting moderate ventricular obstruction, was detected by Doppler velocimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data obtained with the combined Doppler-echocardiographic method confirm that the quality of mitral function is excellent after Carpentier mitral valvuloplasty </plain></SENT>
