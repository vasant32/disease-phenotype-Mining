<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to assess what can be achieved with an automatic signal processing system for artifact/microembolic signals and solid/gas differentiation in different clinical situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors studied 3,428 HITS in vivo in a multicenter study, i.e., 1,608 artifacts in healthy subjects, 649 solid emboli in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, and 1,171 gaseous emboli in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They worked with the dual-gate TCD combined to three types of statistical classifiers: binary decision trees (BDT), artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector machines (SVM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity to separate artifacts from microembolic signals by BDT reached was 94% and 97%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the discrimination between solid and gaseous emboli, the classifier achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 81% for BDT, 84% and 84% for ANN, and 86% and 86% for SVM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current results for artifact elimination and solid/gas differentiation are already useful to extract data for future prospective clinical studies </plain></SENT>
