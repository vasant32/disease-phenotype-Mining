<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To measure cerebral vascular and neuronal responses after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the living mouse, we generated a mouse model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> localized to the parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male C57/6J or male transgenic mice (2 to 3 months old) expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were used in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single fibrin-rich clot (8 mm in length) was injected into a branch of the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements were performed to measure ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using confocal and 2-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> microscopy, changes in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, dendrites, and dendritic spines were measured in the living mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight of 11 mice (73%) had the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> localized to a branch of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in the parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expansion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> within the artery was observed 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of ischemic lesion in the parietal cortex was verified by MRI measurements, and histopathological analysis revealed that these mice (n=8) had a cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of 4.9+/-3.6% of the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the living mouse, substantial loss of YFP-labeled axonal and dendritic structures as well as the formation of abnormal dendritic bulbs were detected in the ischemic boundary regions 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with that 1 hour after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This model offers a novel approach to study the neurovascular unit in cerebral cortex after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the living mouse </plain></SENT>
