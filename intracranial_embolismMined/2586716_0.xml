<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> that occurred after chest trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by CT and skull roentgenogram which demonstrated air bubbles in intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is well recognized that cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is caused by various diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But it may often be overlooked because it is diagnosed clinically and there are no characteristic symptoms nor signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although various ways of treatment have been reported, prevention and early diagnosis are the most important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is very rare that air bubbles are detected in skull roentgenograms in cases of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only three other cases have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these cases reported by Westcott awakens our interest because the patient died within only several minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and underwent cardiac massage before the roentgenogram was taken, in the same way as our case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We think some artificial force is necessary to push air into intracranial arteries to the extent that it is detected on a skull roentgenogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Little has been reported on CT findings in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Roughly speaking, three kinds of abnormal findings have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They are air, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In only nine cases including ours, air bubbles were detected on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In those cases CT scans were performed soon after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, twelve hours at the latest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Abnormal findings were detected in either bilateral hemispheres or in the right hemisphere only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions are located in the territory of the cortical branches, but in one case bilateral, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> was noted, which is thought to be caused by embolism of thalamoperforators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
