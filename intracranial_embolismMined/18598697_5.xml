<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the neuroprotective actions of melagatran using an embolic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We first examined protective effects at increasing doses of melagatran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, we examined the effects of melagatran administered at different time points following middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the effects of combination therapy with melagatran and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we examined if melagatran can improve compromised microcirculation in the ischemic injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The medication alone or in combination with tPA was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Melagatran reduced ischemic brain injury in a dose-response manner, and also in a time dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment of melagatran and tPA was superior to either treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant increase in symptomatic or asymptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> in the treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Melagatran treatment also reduced perfusion deficits in the ischemic injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study is the first report on the usefulness of melagatran in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our research shows that melagatran is an effective agent in the treatment of ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of this medication are likely due to its actions in enhancing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> dissolution and preventing formation of microthrombosis in the ischemic injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, the combination with melagatran and tPA appears safe and superior to each treatment offered alone </plain></SENT>
