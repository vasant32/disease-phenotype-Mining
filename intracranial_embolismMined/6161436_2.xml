<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1960 and 1979, 28 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the extracranial carotid artery were seen in 27 patients at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of these patients noticed a pulsating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, 12 patients had neurological symptoms; 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were ruptured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five times the external carotid artery, and 3 times the internal carotid artery were ligated without neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> resection, the carotid artery was reconstructed in 4 cases by direct suture, and in 2 cases by patch angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reconstruction was accomplished with a tube-graft in 9 instances, once an extra-intracranial shunt had to be performed in advance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed neurological deficiencies after the operation (8.7%), in one of them these were permanent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up, 20 patients were without symptoms (87%), 3 patients died after the operation (peri-operative mortality 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of the 5 non-operated patients 2 died after a short time: one of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and one of an extensive cerebro-vascular infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients with asymptomatic internal carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> refused the operation and are without symptoms for 2 and 40 years respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of the potential risks of cerebro-vascular infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture, good results of operative treatment call for an aggressive surgical approach in dealing with extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
