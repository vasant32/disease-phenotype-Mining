<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients were enrolled in five clinical sites in Germany and Italy with either an asymptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> &gt; or =75% (mean 87%) or a symptomatic stenosis &gt; or =60% (mean 85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protection during the stenting procedure was achieved using an endovascular clamping technique, obtained by occlusion of the external and common carotid artery via two independently inflatable balloons integrated in the Mo.Ma system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood with particulate plaque debris was aspirated before flow was restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's clinical and the neurological status were assessed during intervention, at discharge, and at 3 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stenting was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean flow occlusion time was 10.6+/-6.5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient clamping intolerance was observed in five patients (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two patients, neurological deficits persisted for 2 and 12 h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (4,7%) occurred at 5 and 72 h after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed at 3 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This first clinical experience with the Mo.Ma device substantiates the feasibility of endovascular clamping in preventing cerebral embolization during carotid artery stenting </plain></SENT>
