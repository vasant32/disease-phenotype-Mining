<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that the gamma ray emitted by a radionuclide is a Poisson process, so its statistic nature should be taken in consideration when the scintiscanning is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But very few attempts have been done from this point of view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After examining in detail the imaging pulse charactristics, the authors introduced a mean for evaluating the fidelity of the collected data, and based on this criterion, pointed out some problems in the conventional scanning method and finally described a statistical way of improving the scintigram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, as a measure of the stochastic fidelity of the scanned data the relative deviation eplision(n) = sigma(n)/E(n) is introduced; sigma is the standard deviation and E(n) is the expectation value of the counting rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the conventional scanning in which the detector moves with a costant speed, the relative deviation varies from area to area according to the concentration of the radioisotope in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the so-called cold area of the brain scintigram, the relative deviation fluctuates remarkably because of a rather low density of radioisotope in this area </plain></SENT>
