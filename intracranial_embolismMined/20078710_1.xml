<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are many options for proximal anastomosis during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but the efficacies of these procedures have not been well clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the clinical impact of our strategy to modify the proximal anastomosis procedure for aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 535 consecutive patients undergoing off-pump CABG between 2004 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three groups depending upon the type of proximal anastomosis procedure: 241 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> underwent partial clamping (clamp group), 81 patients with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> underwent the procedure with Heartstring (Guidant Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA), 28 patients underwent with Enclose II (Novare Surgical Systems, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA) (device group), and 185 patients underwent the procedure without clamping, including six with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (no-touch group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were seven in-hospital mortalities (1.3%) and five <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the mortality rate (clamp, 1.2%; device, 1.8%; no-touch, 1.1%; p = 0.42) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate (clamp, 0.8%; device, 2.8%; no-touch, 0.5%; p = 0.09) among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Graft patency was similar regardless of the method (clamp, 94.7%; Heartstring, 96.7%; Enclosed II, 96.0%; p = 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our strategy to modify the proximal anastomosis procedure resulted in a low <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic clamping could be performed safely in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or mild atherosclerotic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, the result of an anastomotic device may need a further investigation </plain></SENT>
