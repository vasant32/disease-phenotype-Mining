<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the complications, rescue procedures, and consequences related to the use of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection filter during carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 72 patients (58 men; mean age 70.0+/-8.2 years, range 56-87) with extracranial atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> who underwent 77 CAS procedures under filter protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Filter-related events and rescue procedures according to each procedural step were retrospectively evaluated on CAS angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, neurological events and outcomes were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CAS using a filter was successful in 99% of cases, and the overall rate of minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=1), major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0), or mortality (n=1) was 2.6% at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Filter placement was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005116'>arterial tortuosity</z:hpo> made it difficult for a filter to pass through the stenosis in 1 case; this was overcome with an additional supportive wire (0.018-inch) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Filter-related events were flow impairment in 6 (7.8%), filter wedging in the catheter tip in 4 (5.2%), vasospasm &gt;50% narrowing in 7 (9.1%), filling defects within the filter membrane in 5 (6.5%), retrieval failure with the provided retriever in 3 (3.9%), and insecure retrieval without filter collapse in 2 (2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow impairment caused drowsy mentality and impaired verbal response in 4, which resolved after prompt filter retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cases of filter wedging were resolved with a catheter pulled down into the stented segment to separate the filter element from the catheter tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant vasospasm and filling defects were spontaneously resolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases after filter retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inability to pass a retriever catheter through a stent was overcome with curved 5-F catheter manipulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of a filter during CAS may induce various angiographic or technical events at each step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For a severely stenotic and tortuous carotid lesion with difficult access, a filter may become trapped or irretrievable during flow arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Physicians should be aware of the preventive and rescue maneuvers to counter filter-related events, perhaps even considering another type of protection mechanism or carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
