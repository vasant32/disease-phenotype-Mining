<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The appropriateness of such intervention is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over a 10-month period, a 58-year-old woman suffered multiple debilitating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accidents</z:e> manifested by motor, sensory, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> and documented by computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid and vertebral arteries were free of arteriosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated two large atheromas with friable, pedunculated forms, one in the aortic arch and one in the very proximal descending thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial ultrasound revealed recurrent cerebral microembolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular events continued, and the atheromas increased in size, despite treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">Coumadin</z:chebi> and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under deep hypothermic arrest, the segment of the aortic arch harboring the atheroma was excised and replaced with a Dacron graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat transcranial ultrasound revealed cessation of embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cerebrovascular events ceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No further anticoagulation therapy was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient has made substantial recovery from the preoperative deficits and continues to do well 1 year after aortic arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Resection of mobile aortic arch atheromas is likely to become increasingly important in the future as transesophageal echocardiography leads to their more common identification as a cause of cerebral ischemic events </plain></SENT>
