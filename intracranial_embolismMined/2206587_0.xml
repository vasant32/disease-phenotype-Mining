<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main purpose was the cardiac evaluation in the different types of cerebrovascular disease: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (H), Cortical ischaemic events (C) and Subcortical ischaemic events (SC) and also to evaluate the interest of echocardiography in detecting occult cardiac sources of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population included 54 men and 52 women with a mean age of 66.8 +/- 10.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A thorough neurologic and cardiologic study with a computed tomography of the brain (<z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>) and an echocardiogram (ECO) were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found 24 (23%) of H, 40 (38%) of C and 32 (30%) of SC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the past history, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> were more prevalent in C (p less than 0.04); previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> (HTA) were less prevalent in H (p less than 0.008) and in C (p less than 0.004), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (FA) was more frequent in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p less than 0.02) and within these in C (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No more clinical and functional cardiac features or echocardiographic aspects had any difference in their prevalence in different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Without clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> there were 19 (18%) cases but only in 10 were found in their echocardiograms a potentially embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (PEHD) but 8 of them had questionable pathologic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion: C had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in their past history; FA is more frequent in C; it is difficult to diagnose a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with only a coexistent C and CPE, but if there is FA or a past history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in a C, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> is more probable; finally, echocardiography is of limited value to diagnose a PEHD in the elderly, however it makes possible to better evaluate most cardiac situations </plain></SENT>
