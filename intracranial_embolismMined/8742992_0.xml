<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 44-year-old woman with thrombotic diathesis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> who was admitted twice within a short period of time (one and a half months) to a neurological department because of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the occasion of the second admission, a colour-Doppler examination of the epiaortic vessels, which had previously been negative, showed a carotid lesion due to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> and, on the same side as the carotid lesion, transcranial Doppler detected short-duration, high-intensity signals in the middle and anterior cerebral arteries, an expression of the passage of microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As already described by other authors in similar clinical situations, our case confirms that transcranial Doppler can identify the passage of microemboli in the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
