<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using transcranial Doppler sonography of the middle cerebral artery, we found Doppler spikes in six symptomatic and 24 asymptomatic patients with mechanical heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No spikes were found in one symptomatic and 21 asymptomatic patients with biological valves or in 20 asymptomatic patients with mechanical valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We concluded that gas cavitation during the opening or closure of the valve, producing bubble emboli, is the most probable explanation for these Doppler spikes in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves </plain></SENT>
