<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emboli were recorded continuously from the time of pericardial incision until 10 min after the last aortic instrumentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The numbers of coronary grafts and of aortic clampings were also documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing revascularization with cardiopulmonary bypass had more emboli (median 79, range 38-876) per case compared with patients having off-pump surgery (median 3, range 0-18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No clinically detectable neurological deficits were seen in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beating heart surgery is associated with fewer emboli than coronary surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further research is necessary to determine whether a smaller number of emboli alters the incidence of neurological deficit after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
