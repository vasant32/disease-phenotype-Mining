<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the pathogenesis of focal cerebral hyperemia, its effect on brain tissue and discusses its pathophysiological and therapeutic importance in the light of interpreting severe hyperemia as a sign of arterial reopening probably due to embolic migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography, serial CT-scans and serial TC99 -scans were performed in a consecutive group of 73 patients with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> admitted to hospital within 3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When possible the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied with the intracarotid Xe 133 injection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients had evidence of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion; rCBF was investigated in 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had either occlusion or severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis; rCBF was not measured in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients had no angiographical evidence of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, ICA occlusion or severe ICA stenosis; rCBF was investigated in 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Focal hyperemia was observed in 21 patients but exclusively in the group with evidence of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hence, these 21 patients are typical and representative for the group of patients with evidence of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hyperemia was found in infarcted as well as in non-infarcted tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apparently, it is the severity of the initial ischemic episode and not the hyperemia that determines whether or not tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> develops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interpreting severe hyperemia as a sign of arterial reopening and embolic migration (evidenced by partial reopening affecting only some <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches) reopening had occurred in about 1/3 of the patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion before they were examined 1 to 4 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Autopsy studies performed in 8 of the patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion indicate that arterial reopening also takes place in many patients later on (7 of 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to this interpretation, hypothetical as it is, the changing position of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> is associated with partial or complete reperfusion leading to hyperemia in the initially ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic basis for appropriate therapy therefore may change from one day to the next in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
