<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Animal models and clinical studies suggest that intraventricular thrombolysis improves clot resolution and clinical outcomes among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this intervention may increase the rates of rebleeding and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the safety and efficacy of intraventricular thrombolysis, we conducted a pilot, randomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> requiring ventriculostomy were randomized to receive intraventricular injections of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline solution or urokinase (25000 international units) at 12-hour intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Injections continued until ventricular drainage was discontinued according to prespecified clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Head computed tomographic scans were obtained daily, for quantitative determinations of <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of clot resolution was estimated for each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve subjects were enrolled (urokinase, seven patients; placebo, five patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Commercial withdrawal of urokinase precluded additional enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The urokinase and placebo groups were similar with respect to age (49.6 versus 55.2 yr, P = 0.43) and presenting Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores (7.14 versus 8.00, P = 0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Randomization to the urokinase treatment arm (P = 0.02) and female sex (P = 0.008) favorably affected the clot resolution rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sex-adjusted clot half-life for the urokinase-treated group was reduced 44.6%, compared with the value for the placebo group (4.69 versus 8.48 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intraventricular thrombolysis with urokinase speeds the resolution of intraventricular blood clots, compared with treatment with ventricular drainage alone </plain></SENT>
