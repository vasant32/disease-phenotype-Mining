<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>5 800,000 of a billion people were investigated in 29 provinces and cities excluding Taiwan province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence, prevalence and mortality were standardized by direct method using the world standard population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 109.95 per 100,000 people in 1986 and its 95% CI (confidence interval) 107.25-112.65 per 100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized incidence was 115.87/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The point prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 245.49 per 100,000 people on December 31, 1986 and its 95% CI 241.57-249.61 per 100,000, with an age-standardized prevalence of 259.86 per 100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mortality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 76.78 per 100,000 in 1986 and its 95% CI 74.52-79.04 per 100,000, with an age-standardized mortality of 80.94 per 100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for the rates to increase gradually from south to north and to decrease progressively from east to west </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The models of linear regression were established between latitude and rates as well as between longitude and rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence, prevalence and mortality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> differed significantly in various topographic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They were much higher in cities than in rural areas, and much higher in men than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence, prevalence and mortality increased with age, and their relationships fitted in Logistic curve well </plain></SENT>
