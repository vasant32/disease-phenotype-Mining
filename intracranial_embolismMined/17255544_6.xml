<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intra-operative cerebral microembolism may be a factor in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> after orthopedic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here examine the impact of intra-operative microembolism on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> after hip and knee replacement surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 24 patients, at least 65 years old, requiring elective knee or hip replacement surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A transcranial Doppler shunt study was done to determine study eligibility so that the final study population consisted of 12 consecutive patients with and 12 consecutive patients without a venous-arterial shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A standard neuropsychological test battery was administered before surgery, at hospital discharge and 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were monitored intra-operatively for microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quality of life data were assessed at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had intra-operative microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean number of emboli was 9.9+/-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> was present in 18/22 (75%) at discharge and in 10/22 (45%) at 3 months, despite improved quality of life measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and intra-operative microembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> was seen frequently after hip and knee surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intra-operative microembolism occurred universally but did not significantly influence postoperative cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Quality of life and functional outcome demonstrated improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in spite of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
