<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The author reports the use of vertebral artery ligation, unilateral and bilateral, for the treatment of large vertebral-basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 14 patients with one delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extracranial ligation was carried out unilaterally with a Selverstone clamp in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two, where the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> filled only from one vertebral artery, there was extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> within the sac and dramatic clinical improvement after decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracranial ligation was done bilaterally in three patients, temporarily in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 14-year-old boy is well after 5 years but the bilateral vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> did not undergo extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> until both vertebral arteries were occluded at their intracranial entrance above collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two others, the clamp had to be reopened on the second artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a huge <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and pontine infarction might have been prevented with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> ruptured again fatally 18 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unilateral intracranial occlusion of a vertebral artery was done in eight cases, with no morbidity and complete or nearly complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had excellent or good results while one showed little recovery from an existing medullary syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the basilar artery was done in seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In five it was used deliberately as the only treatment, but in two it was forced when an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> burst during dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only two of the patients in the first group and one of the second group have made complete recoveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results of vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> are encouraging and the technique deserves further consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Extensive collateral circulation enhances the safety of cervical vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> but can be of a degree to make the occlusion ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For intracranial occlusion knowledge of the size and distribution of each vertebral artery is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the basilar artery is dangerous, although it seems to be effective in producing extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It should probably be done under anesthesia only when the artery fills spontaneously from the carotid circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, even when reasonable posterior communicating arteries are demonstrated, it is best to test occlusion under local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
