<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because of the demonstrated suitability of the guinea pig (Cuvis cobaya) for a large variety of laboratory investigations, we sought to develop a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in this animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many ingenious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models in other animals exist; some depend on anomalous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, others utilize methods of intracranial or extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> and yet others combine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and anoxic damage (1-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As one proposed application for this work was to study immune responses following experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, survival of several days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was a requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three to five days elapse before detection of a hymoral and cellular immune response is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The guinea pig is especially suited to immunological studies because of the enormous amount of accumulated data on the immunology of this animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the guinea pig has proved relatively invulnerable to existing small animal techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover the unacceptably short postoperative survival associated with the use of existing techniques necessitated the development of a new procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have successfully pursued the development of an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> procedure applicable to this animal </plain></SENT>
