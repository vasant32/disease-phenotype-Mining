<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of our study was to assess the utility of TEE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with and without clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated if multiplane TEE, versus mono and biplane TEE, provides additional information about potential cardiac sources of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 89 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients were studied: 30 patients with a history and clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> (Group A) and 59 patients without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a documented ischemic lesion of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who had an extracardiac potential source of emboli were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, transthoracic (TTE) and biplane TEE were performed, whereas omniplane TEE was performed in 40 patients only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group A, sources of emboli were disclosed by TTE in 33% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When TEE was performed the percentage of positive cases raised to 83% (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Group B, TTE was positive in only 10% of the patients as opposed to 43% with TEE (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Omniplane TEE revealed a potential source of emboli in 23 out of 40 (57%) patients versus 16/40 (40%) and 20/40 (50%) with monoplane and biplane, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TEE is useful in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in whom clinical evaluation and TTE are negative for sources of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TEE is of great value in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in whom an extracardiac potential source of emboli has been excluded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
