<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 118 patients with an initial major hemispheric syndrome; 14 patients (12%) had SSD </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with a potential cardiac source of emboli, SSD was more likely to occur in nondiabetic men less than 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
