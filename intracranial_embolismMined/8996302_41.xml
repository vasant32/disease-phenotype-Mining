<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) alone affects the fibrinocoagulation system, we examined the relation between fibrinocoagulation activity and duration of AF in patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF are at higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and a hypercoagulative state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether this hypercoagulative state is attributable to AF alone or to the underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are no reports on the fibrinocoagulation properties in PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fibrinocoagulation variables in 21 patients with PAF were measured during AF and 7 days after recovery of sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were positive correlations between the duration of AF and beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, thrombin-antithrombin III complex and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These variables increased significantly 12 h after the occurrence of PAF; thus, patients were classified into two groups according to the duration of PAF: PAF-I group (&lt; 12 h, n = 10), PAF-II group (&gt; or = 12 h, n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine age-matched, healthy subjects formed the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and thrombin-antithrombin III complex and fibrinogen levels tended to be but were not significantly higher (p = 0.06, ANOVA), in the PAF-II group than in the PAF-I group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups in activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer or plasmin inhibitor complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that AF itself enhances platelet aggregation and coagulation, which are influenced by the duration of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The acceleration of platelet activity and coagulability occurred 12 h after the occurrence of AF </plain></SENT>
