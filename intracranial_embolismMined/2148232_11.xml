<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, fibrinogen and fibrinopeptide A levels were elevated significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages (p less than 0.001), whereas plasmin-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex and D dimer levels were elevated significantly in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antithrombin III activity was significantly decreased in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elevation of fibrinogen and plasmin-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex levels in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage was significantly greater in patients with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size greater than 10 mm2 compared to patients with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size less than 10 mm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed similar changes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that enhanced coagulation exists at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages and endogenous fibrinolysis is activated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> periods in a large proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and embolism </plain></SENT>
