<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of three sets of the double-tracer autoradiographic technique to measure topographical changes of local cerebral blood flow (LCBF), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (LCGU), and tissue pH following a 3 h middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in the rat is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a sham-operated group of animals there was 10% reduction of LCBF and 7% reduction of LCGU in the most affected areas as compared to the contralateral homologous regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the ratio of LCGU/LCBF in the affected areas remained within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-occluded animals, LCGU showed a bimodal response to decreased LCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LCGU decreased with reduced LCBF until LCBF fell to 38% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Below this LCBF level LCGU increased, most likely implying anerobic glycolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decline of tissue pH corresponds to the mismatch of LCBF and LCGU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that brain tissue pH change cannot be predicted on the basis of LCBF or LCGU alone </plain></SENT>
