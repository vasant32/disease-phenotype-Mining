<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral injury after cardiac surgery is now recognized as a serious and costly healthcare problem mandating immediate attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To effect solution, those subgroups of patients at greatest risk must be identified, thereby allowing efficient implementation of new clinical strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No such subgroup has been identified; however, patients undergoing intracardiac surgery are thought to be at high risk, but comprehensive data regarding specific risk, impact on cost, and discharge disposition are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied 273 patients enrolled from 24 diverse US medical centers, who were undergoing intracardiac and coronary artery surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient data were collected using standardized methods and included clinical, historical, specialized testing, neurological outcome and autopsy data, and measures of resource utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse outcomes were defined a priori and determined after database closure by a blinded independent panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression models were developed to estimate the relative risks associated with clinical history and intraoperative and postoperative events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adverse cerebral outcomes occurred in 16% of patients (43/273), being nearly equally divided between type I outcomes (8.4%; 5 cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 16 nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and 2 new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) and type II outcomes (7.3%; 17 new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>intellectual deterioration</z:hpo> persisting at hospital discharge and 3 newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Associated resource utilization was significantly increased--prolonging median intensive care unit stay from 3 days (no adverse cerebral outcome) to 8 days (type I; P&lt;0.001) and from 3 to 6 days (type II; P&lt;0.001), and increasing hospitalization by 50% (type II, P=0.04) to 100% (type I, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, specialized care after hospital discharge was frequently necessary in those with type I outcomes, in that only 31% returned home compared with 85% of patients without cerebral complications (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant risk factors for type I outcomes related primarily to embolic phenomena, including proximal aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e>, and intermittent clamping of the aorta during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For type II outcomes, risk factors again included proximal aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, as well as a preoperative history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e>, perioperative dysrhythmia or poorly controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and the development of a low-output state after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These prospective multicenter findings demonstrate that patients undergoing intracardiac surgery combined with coronary revascularization are at formidable risk, in that 1 in 6 will develop cerebral complications that are frequently costly and devastating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, new strategies for perioperative management--including technical and pharmacological interventions--are now mandated for this subgroup of cardiac surgery patients </plain></SENT>
