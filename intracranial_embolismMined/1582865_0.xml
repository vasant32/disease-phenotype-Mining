<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptoms and complications of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> are: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo>, cerebral embolization and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied a family with 7 members known to have HHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3 had PAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 died of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011919'>pleural empyema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PAVF were diagnosed at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 (nephew) suffered from a cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>-bearing part of the lung was removed by wedge resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient 3 (son of the former) had no symptoms, but the arterial <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> was 6.7 kPa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In order to prevent complications like in his father, the patient was operated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A lobar resection was necessary to remove the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was eventless in patients 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude, that periodical thorax X-ray studies are indicated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of families with HHT in order to find PAVF before complications occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The classical treatment is resection of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> with as little lung tissue as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Good results have been reported lately with embolization of PAVF, but this method is not generally available yet </plain></SENT>
