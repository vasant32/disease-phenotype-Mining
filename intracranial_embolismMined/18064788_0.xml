<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study is to evaluate results of endovascular treatment in patients at high risk of endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between years 2001-2006, 210 carotid artery stenoses in 204 patients were treated in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourty seven percent of patients suffered from symptomatic stenosis, asymptomatic stenosis was proved in 53% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> asymptomatic patients had stenosis more than 70% measured according to NASCET, mostly with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedure was technically successful in 99% of patients, mortality was 0.49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural embolic complications based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> were observed in 2.39% of patients, symptoms of minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 0.47% and symptoms of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 0.47% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mortality and disabled morbidity rate in the whole group was 0.96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fifty three patients (73%) were followed up, during this time, 7 patients (3.9%) developed hemodynamically significant restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> treatment with cerebral protection seems to be a safe method of treatment with acceptable short-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, long-term follow-up is needed to get enough data about safety and effectiveness of this method compared to endarterectomy and best medical therapy </plain></SENT>
