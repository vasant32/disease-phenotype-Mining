<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To overcome the drawbacks of femoral access for CAS and reduce embolic load, some have proposed cervical access with internal carotid artery (ICA) flow reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a series of patients at high risk for femoral access who underwent transcervical CAS with ICA flow reversal, we report clinical outcome and intraoperative embolization rates measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A series of 48 patients were selected for transcervical CAS with carotid flow reversal from September 2004 to July 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indications used for this technique were age &gt;or=80 years, severe aortic and epiaortic vessel tortuosity, widespread calcification of aortic arch or epiaortic vessels, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306762" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortoiliac occlusive disease</z:e>, large <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, and aortobifemoral prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the procedure, no adjunctive maneuvers such as external carotid artery balloon occlusion were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 48 patients, 43 underwent preoperative and postoperative cerebral DW-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in the 48 patients was 2.1% (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, one minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the procedures led to carotid dissections or access-site complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 43 patients who underwent DW-MRI, 16 new ischemic lesions were disclosed in six patients (13.9%), four (9.3%) of whom remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ischemic lesions were ipsilateral to the treated carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients at high risk for the transfemoral approach, transcervical carotid stenting with flow reversal achieves good technical and clinical results and seems able to reduce the incidence of postoperative DW-MRI ischemic lesions previously reported for transfemoral filter-protected CAS </plain></SENT>
