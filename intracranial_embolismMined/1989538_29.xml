<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transcranial Doppler technique enabled the detection of cerebral air emboli in 10 of 10 patients during open-heart valve operations despite standard deairing procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this technique, the occurrence of emboli in the right middle cerebral artery was followed continuously in patients undergoing aortic or mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Membrane oxygenators were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scattered emboli were observed during the insertion of the aortic cannula, at the start of cardiopulmonary bypass, and after the declamping of the aorta with the heart beating while empty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the period of aortic cross-clamping, no emboli were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite careful deairing procedures, the recordings indicated a large amount of emboli during filling of the empty beating heart in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study indicates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in open heart procedures are most likely to occur during the redistribution of blood from the heart-lung machine to the patient when the heart is beginning to eject actively, despite careful standard deairing procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meticulous deairing before declamping the aorta is strongly advocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, a short period of filling of the beating heart before final closure of the aortic incision or vent may decrease the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A concomitant reduction in cerebral blood flow by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> or both during filling of the empty beating heart may also be beneficial </plain></SENT>
