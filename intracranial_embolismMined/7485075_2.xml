<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the degree of hemostatic system activation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, detailed coagulation studies were performed in 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and in 36 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, together with 6 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and 37 age-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex, plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex and D-dimer were significantly higher, and antithrombin III and protein C were significantly lower than those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma fibrinogen concentration was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> than that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in these variables between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no difference in these parameters between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that a sustained activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, and it might contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
