<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Distal cerebral embolization is a known complication of carotid interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively investigated whether subclinical microembolization seen on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in patients undergoing carotid revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing carotid interventions and eligible for MRI scanning were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 247 patients who received preoperative and postoperative MRI evaluations, 51 also completed neuropsychologic testing before and at 1 month after their procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive evaluation included the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) for memory evaluation and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for general <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 51 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men), comprising 16 with carotid artery stenting (CAS) and 35 with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), were a mean age of 71 years (range, 54-89 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them, 27 patients (53%) were symptomatic preoperatively, including 11 who had prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 16 who had prior preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients had significant medical comorbidities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (96%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (31.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (47%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (15.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients (4%) had prior ipsilateral CEA and eight had contralateral carotid occlusion (15.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Memory decline evident on RAVLT was identified in eight CAS patients and 13 CEA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had evidence of procedure-related microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although there was no significant difference in baseline cognitive function or memory change between the CEA and CAS cohorts, the CAS cohort had a significantly higher incidence of microembolic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis showed that procedure-related microembolization was associated with memory decline (P = .016) as evident by change in RAVLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A history of neurologic symptoms was significantly associated with poor baseline cognitive function (MMSE; P = .03) and overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> (change in MMSE; P = .026), as determined by Wilcoxon rank sum test and linear regression analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although CEA and CAS are effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention, with minimal neurologic complication, neurocognitive effects remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Procedure-associated microembolization and pre-existing neurologic symptoms are associated with poor baseline cognitive function and memory decline after the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further comprehensive cognitive evaluation to determine the benefit of carotid interventions is warranted </plain></SENT>
