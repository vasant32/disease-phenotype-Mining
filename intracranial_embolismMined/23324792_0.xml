<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: New surgical and perfusion techniques allow the avoidance of deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> during open aortic arch surgery, which is generally necessary in patients with an unclampable porcelain aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate operative and long-term results in patients with a porcelain aorta who underwent conventional cardiac surgery using current surgical and perfusion techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between November 2003 and February 2012, 30 consecutive patients (mean age 68 ± 11 years, 10 patients had previous cardiac surgery with use of glue in 5 of them) with porcelain aorta diagnosed by computed tomography and defined as a severe circular calcification of the proximal thoracic aorta were referred for cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent conventional surgery with arterial cannulation of the innominate (8) or a carotid artery (22) for arterial return </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During mild hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, unilateral cerebral perfusion through the arterial line was performed for cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The valve surgery consisted of aortic, mitral or double valve repair in 23, 3 and 4 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic surgery (17 complete root replacements with valve composite grafts and 22 arch replacements) and coronary revascularization due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (15) were the most frequent concomitant procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 3.3% (1 patient died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0156149" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel ischaemia</z:e> caused by severe stenosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> and upper mesenteric arteries) and the rate of permanent neurological deficit was 3.3% as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two further patients died during the follow-up at age 91 and 82 years, respectively; however, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was cardiac or valve related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival at 5 years was 87.3 ± 7.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no cardiac reoperations, new interventions or aortic- or valve-related events noted during the median follow-up of 45 months (range 0.1-106.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Conventional cardiac and aortic surgery offers definitive repair and can be performed safely using current perfusion and operative techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although more invasive, this surgical technique provides mortality and morbidity rates that do not exceed those reported for transcatheter valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The curative replacement of the pathological proximal aorta, which is one of the most main sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, leads to excellent neurological outcome during mid- to long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
