<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Technical advances in the early, accurate diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, the constant infusion of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and closer monitoring of anticoagulation have continued to reduce the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in treated patients </plain></SENT>
