<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It provides blood supply to the 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerves, as well as to the gasserian ganglion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ILT anastomoses to branches of the internal maxillary artery, providing collateral circulation between the external carotid artery and the ICA systems </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 5th case involving iatrogenic occlusion of the ILT and no neurological deficit is also presented, demonstrating that the ILT is not the sole blood supply of the cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
