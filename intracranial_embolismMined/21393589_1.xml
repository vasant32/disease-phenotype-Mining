<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate if the number of particulate cerebral microemboli during coronary angiography is influenced by access site used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-one patients with stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> referred for coronary angiography were randomized to right radial or right femoral arterial access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of particulate microemboli passing the middle cerebral arteries was continuously registered with transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median (minimum-maximum range) numbers of particulate emboli were significantly higher with radial 10 (1-120) than with femoral 6 (1-19) access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More particulate microemboli passed the right middle cerebral artery with the radial access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the radial access used for coronary angiography generates more particulate cerebral microemboli than the femoral access and thus may influence the occurrence of silent cerebral injuries </plain></SENT>
