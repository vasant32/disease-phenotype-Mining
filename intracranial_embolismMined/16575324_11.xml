<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> associated with endovascular embolization of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Correlations between radiological findings (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size, localization, embolization time, number of coils used, as well as patient age) were evaluated with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-eight patients treated for unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> (mean age, 49 yr) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hyperintense lesions on diffusion weighted imaging were analyzed in 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> size was 3 to 15 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was achieved in 55 of 68 (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had a transient <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was one infarction and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture during the procedure with no consecutive neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found new hyperintense lesions in 21 of 50 (42%) diffusion weighted imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 43% of these, there was only one lesion smaller than 2 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 33%, there was more than one lesion less than 2 mm; in 19%, we found a lesion of 2 to 10 mm in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one case, a lesion greater than 10 mm occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location and the occurrence of lesions or among the number of coils used, the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, patient age, or embolization time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 0%, morbidity 4.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If the 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> where no diffusion weighted imaging was obtained are included, morbidity is 2.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> suggests that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is not sufficient to prevent ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>An antiplatelet therapy, started before or during intervention, might diminish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
