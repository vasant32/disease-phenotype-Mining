<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Review of the clinical literature indicates a lack of suitably quantitated studies of specific intellectual defects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the performance of patients with multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MID), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> (VBI) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients ranging in age from 45 to 85 years (x 66) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in cognitive and intellectual performance were found between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> due to VBI and MID versus neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the Alzheimer's type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group with AD performed significantly and consistently lower on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the two cerebrovascular disease groups, even though the MID group performed consistently more poorly than the VBI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A discriminant function analysis classified 74% of the patients correctly based on the individual WAIS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was more easily made when tasks measuring visual motor coordination and abstract reasoning were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
