<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic circulating emboli can be detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasound, are frequent in patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, and predict recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">S-nitrosoglutathione</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi>) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi> that appears to have relative platelet specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated its effectiveness in reducing embolization in patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> who already were taking aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients with &gt; or =50% internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and with &gt; or =3 embolic signals detected during a half-hour screening recording were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had taken aspirin for at least 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> (4.4 mmol/kg per minute) or saline placebo for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler recordings were made from the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery for 1 hour before treatment and at 0 to 3, 6, and 24 hours after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, the mean (range) of embolic signals per hour was 6.9 (3 to 13) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> group and 7.3 (4 to 12) in the placebo group (P=0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> resulted in a rapid reduction in the frequency of embolic signals of 84% at 0 to 3 hours, 95% at 6 hours, and 100% at 24 hours (P&lt;0.0001, P=0.003, and P&lt;0.0001 versus placebo, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Continued embolization is common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> despite aspirin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> was highly effective in rapidly reducing the frequency of embolic signals in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite its short administration time and its short half-life, it resulted in therapeutic effects lasting 24 hours </plain></SENT>
