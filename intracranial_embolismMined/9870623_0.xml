<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the influence of an experimental venous and arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> on the hearing level in laboratory mini pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before and after the injection of air a threshold ABR was measured in anaesthetized mini pigs (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> was performed in 6 animals: no changes in the hearing level or in the interpeak latencies Jewett wave V-I were observed in any of the animals before, during or after the application of air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 9 animals the arterial embolism was done, 2 animals died and had to be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 6 animals out of 7 a hearing loss was observed starting after the injection of 40 ml air and finally ending in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> for these 6 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detected hearing loss is probably of cochlear origin, as no prolongations of the interpeak latencies of Jewett wave V-I at 90 dB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> were observed prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that air bubbles in the arterial circulation lead to cochlear damage ending in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our research indicates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011119" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">decompression sickness</z:e>, which is comparable to the arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>, is more often the cause of a <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> after diving than previously believed </plain></SENT>
