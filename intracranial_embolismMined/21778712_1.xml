<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 270 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who had DWI-documented cortical or subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> without significant stenosis of the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As embolic sources, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> diseases and an aortic arch atheroma â‰¥4.0 mm in thickness were identified using various diagnostic tools including TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-eight (29%) patients had multiple embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were common in patients in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> was the only embolic source and uncommon in patients in whom aortic atheroma was the only embolic source (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vertebrobasilar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were relatively common in patients only having aortic atheromas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>Atrial septal aneurysms</z:hpo> were more common in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> than in those with a shunt plus other embolic sources (p = 0.0036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unique characteristics of the arch atheroma (mobile plaque, extension to branches, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> formation; p &lt; 0.0001) as well as small or moderate-sized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (p = 0.0004) were more common in patients with arch atheromas as the only embolic source than in those with atheromas plus other embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients often have multiple embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests the possibility that embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has unique clinical features depending on its source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DWI and TEE findings might be helpful in characterizing cardiogenic, paradoxical and aortogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
