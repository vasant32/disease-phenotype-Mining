<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>56 cases of thrombolysis were analyzed and results were compaired with conservative medical therapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For ICA embolism, we stopped thrombolysis in the early period because of its poor collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> embolism seemed to be a good candidate for this treatment and results were significantly better than the conservative medical therapy group in good recovery rate, severe disablity rate and large size infarction rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In basilar artery embolism, thrombolysis seemed to be the most effective treatment in spite of the high mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment CBF measurement was important and useful to estimate the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and it could make it possible to avoid severe hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
