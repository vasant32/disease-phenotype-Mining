<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an occasional patient, however, a seemingly paradoxical pattern of regional hyperperfusion with a return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or subnormal perfusion following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon, called "luxury perfusion," has been defined using intra-arterial 133Xe for semiquantitative cerebral blood flow measurements and should be kept in mind as a potentially misleading cerebral imaging pattern </plain></SENT>
