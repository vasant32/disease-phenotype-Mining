<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Microembolism during cardiopulmonary bypass has been suggested as being the predominant cause of neurocognitive disorders after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Shed blood, normally retransfused into the patient during cardiopulmonary bypass, is a major source of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> microemboli in the brain capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A newly developed technique based on acoustic standing-wave separation of particles in fluid in microchannels, with the capacity to remove <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> particles in blood, is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A separator consisting of eight parallel, high-fidelity microfabricated channels was actuated with an ultrasound field to create a standing wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three different concentrations of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> particles (diameter, 0.3 microm) were added to blood samples with increasing hematocrits and introduced into the separator channels to separate <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> particles and erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean separation rates for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> particles were 81.9% +/- 7.6% and for erythrocytes 79.8% +/- 9.9%, and both were related to the hematocrit level of the incoming blood sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedure was atraumatic and did not cause <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Particle separation by means of an acoustic standing-wave technique can be used for atraumatic and effective removal of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> particles from blood, with the possible clinical implication of reducing neurocognitive complications after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
