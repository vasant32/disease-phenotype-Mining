<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neural progenitor cells isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult rat were labeled by superparamagnetic particles and intracisternally transplanted into the adult rat 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after the transplantation, an array of MRI parameters were measured, including high resolution 3D MRI and quantitative T1, T1sat (T1 in the presence of an off-resonance irradiation of the macromolecules of brain), T2, the inverse of the apparent forward transfer rate for magnetization transfer (kinv), cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and blood-to-brain transfer constant (Ki) of Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The von Willerbrand factor (vWF) immunoreactive images of coronal sections obtained at 6 weeks after cell transplantation were used to analyze vWF immunoreactive vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements revealed that grafted neural progenitor cells selectively migrated towards the ischemic boundary regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic boundary regions, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> confirmed by an increase in vascular density and the appearance of large thin wall mother vessels was coincident with increases of CBF and CBV (CBF, P &lt; 0.01; CBV, P &lt; 0.01) at 6 weeks after treatment, and coincident with transient increases of K(i) with a peak at 2 to 3 weeks after cell therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative T1, T1sat, T2, and kinv decreased in the ischemic boundary regions with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> compared to that in the non-angiogenic ischemic region (T1, P &lt; 0.01 at 6 weeks; T1sat, P &lt; 0.05 at 2 to 6 weeks; T2, P &lt; 0.05 at 3 to 6 weeks; kinvP &lt; 0.05 at 6 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these methods, Ki appear to be the most useful <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> measurements which identify and predict the location and area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CBF, CBV, T1sat, T1, T2, and kinv provide complementary information to characterize ischemic tissue with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that select MRI parameters can identify the cerebral tissue destined to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> after treatment of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with cell therapy </plain></SENT>
