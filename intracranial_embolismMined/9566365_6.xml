<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is useful during the initial hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prourokinase is a novel thrombolytic agent with potential safety advantages in comparison to rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were embolized with autologous blood clots into the middle cerebral artery territory and then randomly assigned at 30 minutes after embolization to a 2-hour bolus infusion with i.a. prourokinase, i.v. prourokinase, or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DWI and PI were performed before treatment and repeated during and at the end of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PI demonstrated that both i.a. and i.v. significantly improved the percentage of the ischemic hemisphere that was normally perfused when the 20-minute, pretreatment, and 145-minute after embolization time points were compared; in the control group, the hypoperfused volume increased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DWI disclosed that the ischemic lesion evolution slightly decreased in the i.a. group, remained stable in the i.v. group, and increased over time in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining was significantly smaller in both treatment groups than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that i.a. and i.v. therapy with prourokinase are equally effective in promoting reperfusion and inhibiting the development of focal ischemic injury in this rat embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
