<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is a devastating complication after coronary artery bypass grafting, occurring in 1.4% to 4.3% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is cerebral embolization of aortic atheromatous debris or calcified plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report analyzes the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients treated according to the clampless concept, i.e. avoiding side-clamping of the aorta, by means of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) in combination with the HEARTSTRING device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a period of 43 months (2005-2008), 412 consecutive patients were treated with the above-mentioned method by one single surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A minimum of one proximal aortal anastomosis was performed in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 542 proximal anastomosis were applied, each created by means of the HEARTSTRING device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 67+9.7 years, the predicted mortality 5.2% (logistic EuroSCORE) and the observed mortality 1.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histories of preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> or cerebrovascular diseases were documented in 15% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 0.48% in contrast to 1.3% according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In accordance to previously published data, our results show that avoiding aortic side-clamping during OPCAB reduces postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The HEARTSTRING device is a safe option for creating proximal aortic anastomosis </plain></SENT>
