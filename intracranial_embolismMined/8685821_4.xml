<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neurons within the ischemic penumbra are thought to be in a potentially reversible state of ischemic challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One therapeutic approach that is being actively explored is the recovery of function of cells within the ischemic penumbra through endovascular recanalization of cerebral arteries occluded with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the time-dependent hemodynamic threshold for the prevention of irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in patients with acutely symptomatic internal and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six patients admitted within 6 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, due to embolic occlusion of the major trunk of one of the arteries of the anterior cerebral circulation, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On admission, both cerebral blood flow (CBF) and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) measurements were obtained following plain computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated by intraarterial administration of urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> in the territory of the affected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> divided by that in the territory of the unaffected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was defined as %<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant negative correlation was found between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with at least 19 mL/100 g/minute CBF and a maximum of 1.6 %<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, no cortical infarction occurred whether or not recanalization was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cortical infarction did not appear in patients with 9 mL/100 g/minute residual CBF and infinite %<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> in whom recanalization was achieved within 2 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, in patients with 13 mL/100 g/minute residual CBF and 3.7 %<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> in whom recanalization was achieved within 2.5 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and in patients with 14 mL/100 g/minute residual CBF and 2.8 %<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> in whom recanalization could be achieved within 3.5 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CBF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> thresholds for conversion of reversible to irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> can be rapidly determined by CT-based technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This type of information should be clinically relevant to guiding the management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
