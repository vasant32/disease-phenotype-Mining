<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dept. of Surgery, University of Vienna, Austria, artificial circulation devices and artificial hearts have been constructed and in experimental use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We started a clinical heart transplantation (HTX) program in 1984, and up to now more than 40 HTXs have been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since May 1986, 3 patients--<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suffering from end stage dilatative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>--received total artificial heart (TAH) as a temporary support until HTX was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of them were transplanted after 9 and 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The third patient, who additionally suffered from a postinfarctial lung <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and had to undergo an indispensable lobectomy contemporary with TAH implantation, could not be transplanted due to an incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, which he died of after 22 days on TAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The temporary TAH implantation proved to be a valuable measure preventing life-threatening circulatory deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After restoration of a sufficient circulation by the implanted system, the patients' general conditions improved and the concomitant dysfunctions of kidneys, brain, and other vital organs, due to cardiogenic shock, could be rectified in those two patients, who underwent transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic complications were observed only in the third patient, who developed a small infarction in the anterior lobe of the left hemisphere caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> after 3 weeks of TAH pumping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of TAH is liable to severe, even lethal, complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At present it should be used only as a last resort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If a donor heart is not available, this measure can be a real chance to save the patient's life </plain></SENT>
