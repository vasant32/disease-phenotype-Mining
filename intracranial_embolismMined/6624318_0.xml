<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aggregate formation was shown to be dramatically increased in simulating a part of a vessel with an altered geometrical pattern of the blood flow, with the increase being more pronounced when the blood from patients with cerebral dyshemias was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, the antiaggregate activity of the blood passing through the internal carotid arteries on the affected side was lower than in other sections of the blood stream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The importance of identified regularities in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases is discussed </plain></SENT>
