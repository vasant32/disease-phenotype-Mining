<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because carotid plaque ulceration is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, residual carotid plaque ulceration directly around a stent (persistent ulceration) after carotid angioplasty and stent placement (CAS) could still be a risk factor for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to understand the morphologic and clinical prognosis of persistent ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND TECHNIQUES: CAS was attempted on 91 consecutive stenotic lesions (80 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 54 lesions (48 patients) had ulceration before CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were evaluated immediately after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Persistent ulceration was found in 34 lesions (30 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean depth and length of persistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were 2.1 mm (range, 1-4.7 mm) and 8.9 mm (range, 1.5-22 mm), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with persistent ulceration were followed with antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No ischemic event due to the lesions occurred during the mean follow-up period of 25.5 months (range, 3-48 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiography on 25 lesions (21 patients) at a mean of 5.8 months (range, 1-21 months) after CAS showed that persistent ulceration disappeared in 12 lesions (48%), improved in 11 lesions (44%), and remained unchanged in 2 lesions (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine lesions (36%) showed restenosis, which were &lt; or =30% and did not require any additional intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New ischemic lesions were not detected in any of the 14 patients (17 lesions) who underwent follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging at a mean of 9 months (range, 1-32 months) after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that persistent ulceration after CAS improves spontaneously and is not a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
