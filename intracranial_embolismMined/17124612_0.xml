<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major risk is perioperative embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) can be used to identify embolic signals and guide therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a case of symptomatic embolization in a 72-year-old female following carotid stent deployment complicated by haemodynamic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite concurrent dual antiplatelet medication significant symptomatic embolization occurred even after restoration of the blood pressure, and modulation of the rate of embolization was achieved using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran-40</z:chebi> guided by TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered from an initially profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo> to minor sensory changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microemboli are common following carotid artery stenting and there appears to be a threshold phenomenon associated with prolonged embolization and progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCD can be used to detect particulate microemboli and therefore may be useful in guiding antithrombotic therapy in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran-40</z:chebi> has been shown to reduce the embolic load following carotid endarterectomy and was used to good effect in this patient in terms of both embolic load and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first case of embolization following carotid stenting successfully treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran-40</z:chebi>, and offers a further option for therapeutic intervention in microembolism detected by TCD and stresses the importance of perioperative monitoring of embolic load for postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
