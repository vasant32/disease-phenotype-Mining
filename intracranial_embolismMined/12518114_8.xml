<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The distal-balloon protection system is being evaluated for its efficacy in preventing embolic neurological events during carotid stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the effect of this system on the frequency of the Doppler-detected microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using transcranial Doppler, we compared the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during CAS in 2 groups; 39 patients without distal protection and 37 with the distal-balloon protection system (GuardWire, Percusurge, Sunnyville, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the clinical or angiographic characteristics between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three phases with increased <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts were identified during the unprotected CAS; stent deployment, predilation, and postdilation (mean+/-SD: 75+/-57, 32+/-36, and 27+/-25, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distal-balloon protection significantly reduced the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during CAS (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-counts: 164+/-108 in the control vs 68+/-83 in the protection group, p=0.002) particularly during these 3 phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the protection group were detected predominantly during sheath placement, guidewire manipulation and during the distal-balloon deflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three phases with increased <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts were identified during the unprotected CAS, e.g. stent deployment, predilation and postdilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distal-balloon protection system significantly reduced the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during CAS, particularly during these 3 phases </plain></SENT>
