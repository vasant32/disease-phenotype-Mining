<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is present in approximately 20% of unselected consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rate of resistance to activated protein C in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the association of factor V mutation with CVT using a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen unselected patients with CVT and 57 healthy control subjects were tested for the point mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mutation was found in a heterozygous form in 4 of the 19 patients with CVT (21%) and in only 1 of the 57 control subjects (2%) (P = .02, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation defect</z:e> found in our patients with CVT was consistent with that observed in previous studies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 3 of the 4 patients positive for the mutation, CVT developed in the presence of an acquired prothrombotic state, including oral contraceptive use in 2 patients and puerperium in the third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> is a risk factor for CVT and may be the most common inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation defect</z:e> associated with this condition </plain></SENT>
