<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> has been increasingly practiced as an alternative to carotid embolectomy, particularly since the development of cerebral protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>100 consecutive elective percutaneous carotid stenting procedures were carried out in our centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here present the clinical outcome and follow-up of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 69 men and 22 women, average age 69 +/- 10 years with symptomatic (41 %) or asymptomatic and progressive (59 %) &gt; 80 % stenosis of the internal carotid artery were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a high rate of co-morbidity and a high vascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>64 % would have been excluded from the NASCET trial because of one, 31 % because of two or more contraindications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 84 % of the patients symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was present, in 13 % a significantly reduced left ventricular function (LVEF &lt; 40 %).Pre- and post-procedure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were given aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and examined by an independent neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>99 stents were placed with the use of an embolic protection device (28 times with distal balloon occlusion, 72 times with a filter device).The follow-up period averaged 10.4 +/- 8.2.(1 - 29 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The angiographic success rate was 99 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the procedure transient neurological symptoms were experienced by 4 % of patients (2x <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>,2x PRIND) and a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> resulted in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 90 % of the interventions debris was collected from the embolic protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The maximum diameter of particles was 311+/-431 (30 - 1850) micro m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was some correlation between patients' symptoms prior to stent implantation and maximum particle size (p &lt; 0,04),but none with any other angiographic or clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The combined endpoint (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) after 30 days occurred 5 times (5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred once, restenosis in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid artery stenting with use of a distal embolic protection device is a feasible new alternative to carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate high success rate and low complication rates, even in patients with severe co-morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The results compare well with surgical figures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our favourable results are supported by data emerging from current randomized multicenter trials and a large therapy registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, long-term follow-up will still be required </plain></SENT>
