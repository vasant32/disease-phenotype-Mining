<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the amount of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in 15 patients with 'lone' AF representing the subgroup of AF patients with the lowest lifelong risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional cardiac and arterial sources of embolism were excluded by echocardiography and extracranial color-coded duplex sonography of the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This observation fits the concept that the amount of microembolisation is related to the risk of manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies on this patient group treated with less intensive antihemostatic therapy should be undertaken to define more clearly the disease-specific microembolic activity </plain></SENT>
