<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but six of the diabetic patients had Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients had more risk factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (p less than 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> (p less than 0.001), than the non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haematocrit levels were higher in the diabetic group (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diabetic patients were more commonly afflicted by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and to a lesser extent by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> than the non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When calculated by log-rank tests, the diabetic group had an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p less than 0.001), recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p = 0.001), and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (p = 0.001) after the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
