<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of delayed thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was tested in an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The carotid territory was embolized in 103 rats with fibrin-rich clots formed and washed in <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> tubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric cerebral blood flow before and after embolization was measured by the intra arterial 133Xe injection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At five delay times, 15-240 min after embolization, 69 animals were treated with tissue plasminogen activator, 20 mg/kg, and 34 animals with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid angiography displayed the grade of occlusion of the cerebral arterial supply before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brains were fixed after 2 days, evaluated neuropathologically, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was reduced by 56-71% after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion induced by thrombolytic therapy was demonstrated by comparing the posttreatment angiography of the pooled five treatment groups to control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic therapy significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved the prekill clinical score by up to 2 h of treatment delay, and treatment might have been beneficial even after 4 h delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prolonging the delay of treatment increased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (p &lt; 0.001, Jonck-heere-Terpstra test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only a few hemorrhagic complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, thrombolytic therapy in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effect on clinical outcome and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was dependent on delay time </plain></SENT>
