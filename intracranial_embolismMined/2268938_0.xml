<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effects of acupuncture were evaluated from the degree of functional <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> damage, EEG-map and somatosensory evoked potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After treatment the results were as follows: the marks of functional <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> damage in the test group were reduced 13.0 average, but only 3.75 in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a very remarkable difference between these two groups (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slow wave of the EEG-map in the test group were reduced 1.70 level average, but only 0.05 in the control group (P less than 0.001). theta wave of the EEG-map in the test group were reduced 1.05 level average, but only 0.25 level in the control group (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diversity of latent period of P45 peak wave value between left limbs and right limbs were reduced evidently in the test group and showed a very significant statistical difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(P less than 0.05) as compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The above results revealed that therapeutic effects of acupuncture were objective and were based on neurophysiological mechanism </plain></SENT>
