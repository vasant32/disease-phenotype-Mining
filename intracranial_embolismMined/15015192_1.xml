<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pre-operative (morning of surgery) and post-operative (48 h) plasma samples were obtained from 75 consecutive patients undergoing CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 concentrations were quantified using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring was performed on each patient to detect particulate embolisation during the dissection phase of the CEA, until the application of carotid clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median post-operative plasma MMP-9 level of emboli-positive patients was significantly higher than their median pre-operative value (14.9 ng/ml vs. 8.8 ng/ml; p=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was seen in the plasma MMP-9 level of emboli-negative patients (7.7 ng/ml vs. 7.1 ng/ml; p=0.364) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A greater rise was seen in the median plasma MMP-9 levels of those patients suffering &gt;2 emboli (from 3.4 to 19.3 ng/ml; p=0.041) than those patients suffering 1 or 2 emboli (from 10.1 to 12.8 ng/ml; p=0.340) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma MMP-9 only rises after CEA in patients with evidence of embolisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This increase is more pronounced in those with high numbers of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the increase in MMP-9 is due to cerebral damage caused by embolisation </plain></SENT>
