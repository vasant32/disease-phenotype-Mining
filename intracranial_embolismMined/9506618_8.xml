<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis is a rare occlusive disease in western populations, with a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An artery-to-artery embolic mechanism has been argued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the detection of a new pattern of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> poststenotic segment in a patient with multiple recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a transient leg monoparesis on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis was detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In spite of aspirin treatment, the patient had a recurrent right hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A new, similar event happened after correct anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bigated TCD monitoring study of both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> disclosed clusters of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> at the poststenotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each cluster contained between 12 and 45 embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient became asymptomatic and clusters of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> disappeared, coinciding with the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We describe a new presentation of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, ie, grouped in clusters of signals, that may be associated with a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
