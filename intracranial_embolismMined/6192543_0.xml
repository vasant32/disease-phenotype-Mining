<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 95 patients with aortic valve replacement (AVR), 107 with mitral valve replacement (MVR) and 28 with aortic and mitral valve replacement (DVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 7.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies included 212 patients with a mean follow-up time of 26.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was 1.2%/patient year after AVR, 2.4%/patient year after MVR and 0 after DVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Freedom from any kind of complications was 80% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recatheterization showed mean pressure gradients of between 0.0 and 6.0 mmHg in aortic prostheses and between 0.0 and 3.5 mmHg in mitral prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the Medtronic-Hall valve prosthesis is a durable substitute with a low complication rate and good hemodynamic performance </plain></SENT>
