<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Microvascular basal lamina damage has been demonstrated after balloon occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in the nonhuman primate and after intravascular filament occlusion in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate in the rat whether microvascular damage can be found in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model of intracarotid clot injection as early as 3 hours after clot injection and whether microvascular damage relates to the level of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microvascular densities and total stained microvascular areas were determined by immunohistochemistry of collagen type IV in cortex and basal ganglia and automatic video-imaging analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rCBF was measured by autoradiography in the same brain areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the corresponding areas in the nonischemic hemisphere, a significant loss of microvascular density (-16%) and total stained microvascular areas (-10%) was observed in these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduction of microvascular basal lamina staining was comparable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals and was not related to the value of rCBF when measured 3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, microvascular damage occurs as soon as 3 hours after intracarotid clot injection, even in brain areas in which rCBF has returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
