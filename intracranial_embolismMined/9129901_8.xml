<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The consequences of the prognosis of such events have never been evaluated by a prospective follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the incidence of symptomatic or asymptomatic embolic events and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in definite infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and to determine whether these events carry a risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 1991 to December 1993, 102 patients with suspected or known infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> were referred to our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, we selected 68 patients (50 males, 18 females, mean age = 52.7 years) exhibiting definite infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> according to the Duke University criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood cultures were positive in 49 cases (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography revealed valvular vegetations in 55 cases (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of the clinical presentation, patients were examined radiologically by cerebral computed tomography scanning (n = 60), magnetic resonance imaging (n = 3), abdominal computed tomography scanning (n = 32) or abdominal echocardiography (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Depending on the symptoms, thoracic computed tomography scanning (n = 22), pulmonary angiography (n = 2), ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy (n = 4), or <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> radionuclide scanning (n = 7) were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were prospectively followed-up for a mean period of 21.4 +/- 17.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 35 patients (51%), 51 embolic or metastatic events were revealed, involving the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (n = 23), spleen (n = 7), kidney (n = 5), lung (n = 5), liver (n = 4), bone and joint (n = 4), iliac (n = 2) or mesenteric (n = 1) arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the hospital stay, the mortality rate was higher in patients exhibiting embolic or metastatic events (20 vs 12%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated no difference in long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that embolic or metastatic events had a high incidence (51%) during infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, but were not associated with significant attributable mortality </plain></SENT>
