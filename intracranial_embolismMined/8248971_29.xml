<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is characterized by its clinical pleomorphism and pathogenetic variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 67 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> associated with pregnancy and puerperium and compared them with 46 other cases unrelated to obstetric causes to disclose differences in their clinical presentation, neuroradiological findings, clinical course, and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging findings of 113 patients collected consecutively at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was confirmed by angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, or neuropathological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> associated with pregnancy and puerperium were younger (average age, 26 versus 36 years), and in most, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (82% versus 54%; P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evolution of symptoms reached a plateau within 10 days in 70% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from obstetric causes, compared with only 45% in those from other causes (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> was more frequent in the obstetric group (64% versus 26%; P = .00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences regarding neurological and neuroradiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the initial severity of illness was similar in both groups, the final outcome was considered good in 80% of patients with obstetric causes, compared with 58% of patients with other causes (P = .01); mortality rates were 9% and 33%, respectively (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> associated with pregnancy and puerperium has a more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> and a better prognosis than <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> due to other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings might be helpful in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
