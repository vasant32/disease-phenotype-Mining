<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the efficacy and safety of a standardized periprocedural anticoagulation regimen with low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 650 consecutive patients with a mechanical heart valve, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, or embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who required interruption of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy because of an invasive procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> was stopped 5 or 6 days before the procedure, and patients received subcutaneous dalteparin <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, 100 IU/kg twice daily, starting 3 days before the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of postprocedural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> determined postprocedural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients undergoing a non-high-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>-risk procedure who had adequate postprocedural hemostasis, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was resumed on the evening of the procedure, and dalteparin <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, 100 IU/kg twice daily, was resumed on the next day and continued until the international normalized ratio was 2.0 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If postprocedural hemostasis was not secured, the resumption of dalteparin was delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients undergoing a high-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>-risk procedure, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was resumed on the evening of the procedure, but dalteparin was not given after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were followed up during the preprocedural and postprocedural period for a mean of 13.8 days (range, 10-18 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 542 patients who underwent a non-high-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>-risk procedure, there were 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (0.4%), 4 major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes (0.7%), and 32 episodes of increased wound-related blood loss that precluded postprocedural dalteparin administration (5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 108 patients who underwent a high-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>-risk procedure, there were 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (1.8%) possibly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and 2 major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes (1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients at increased risk for arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> who require temporary interruption of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy, a standardized periprocedural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> regimen with low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is associated with a low risk of thromboembolic and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
