<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although asymptomatic embolization can be detected in patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, its temporal variability is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An understanding of this is important in designing optimal recording protocols for future prospective studies of the predictive value of embolic signals (ES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the effect of repeating and extending recording times in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 20 asymptomatic and 20 symptomatic subjects with &gt; 60% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, we used transcranial Doppler ultrasound to record for ES in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three 1-hour recordings were performed on three separate days, and on one occasion (not necessarily the first) the recording was extended to 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recordings were saved onto digital tape for subsequent blinded analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Marked temporal variability was seen in symptomatic patients in whom the cumulative proportion of subjects with ES increased from 10 (50%) after a single hour of recording to 12 (60%) and 15 (75%) after two and three recordings, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extending the recording to 2 hours increased the yield of ES-positive patients from 6 (30%) to 8 (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic patients there was excellent agreement between whether patients were positive for ES during each of two consecutive 1-hour recordings (kappa = 0.78, P = 0.0003) but poor agreement between the results of two single-hour recordings performed on different days (kappa = 0.22, P = 0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In asymptomatic patients, 4 (20%) were ES positive during the first hour; this increased to 5 (25%) after the recording was repeated once, with no further increase after the third recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extending the recording to 2 hours increased the yield from 3 (15%) to 7 (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to symptomatic stenoses, in patients with asymptomatic stenoses there was fair agreement between whether patients were ES positive on two consecutive 1-hour recordings (kappa = 0.49, P = 0.01) or two single-hour recordings performed on different days (kappa = 0.48, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic subjects were more likely to have ES (when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 1-hour recordings were considered, 24/60 versus 10/60; P = 0.0046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ES in symptomatic subjects had a higher relative intensity increase than in asymptomatic subjects (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The temporal variability of ES needs to be taken into account in the design of optimal recording protocols and comparisons of results from different studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Extending the duration of recording beyond an hour in symptomatic stenoses is of less value, but repeating the recording on a different day will often identify additional subjects with ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In intervention studies in symptomatic patients, the time since last symptoms must be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In asymptomatic stenosis, extending the duration of recording beyond an hour will increase the proportion of patients positive for ES </plain></SENT>
