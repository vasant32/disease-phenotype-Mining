<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we review our experience with sigmoid colon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: We present our experience of 81 cases of sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo> admitted to our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo> detortion was attempted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and in 39 of them the procedure was successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The success rate of endoscopic detortion for sigmoid colon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo> with a flexible colonoscope (60%) was higher than with a rigid rectosigmoidoscope (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 19 of these 39 non-operatively devolvulated patients, sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis was performed within 7-10 days after reduction, but 20 patients did not accept the elective operation after a non-operative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 61 patients undergoing urgent or elective operation for sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo>, there were 17 laparotomies with only detortion, 19 resections with elective anastomosis, 6 resections with primary anastomosis, and 19 resections with a Hartmann's pouch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (21%) among 42 patients who underwent an emergency operation, and one (5.2%) among the 19 patients who had elective surgery died because of a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Initial therapy with endoscopy affords decompression and an adequate preparation of patients for surgical resection, and a flexible colonoscope has notable advantages over rigid instruments for the detortion process </plain></SENT>
