<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinical relevance of the microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) detected by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study the authors analyzed the relationship between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and the findings on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed TCD for a period of 30 min to detect <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in patients within 24 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and DWI was done within the initial 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were assessed from Doppler waves obtained from the middle cerebral artery contralateral to the side of the neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions observed on DWI were classified by their diameter (small, medium or large) and by their site (cortical, superficial perforator territory, internal borderzone or deep perforator territory) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We obtained Doppler waves from 39 vessels in 37 patients; 2 patients had bilateral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 12 vessels (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-positive group) and not detected in 27 vessels (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-negative group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in clinical features were observed between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of small lesions was significantly higher in the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-positive group than in the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-negative group (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The numbers of cortical and superficial perforator <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were significantly higher in the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-positive group than in the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-negative group (p = 0.002 and 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detected by TCD in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase may produce small cortical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> found on DWI </plain></SENT>
