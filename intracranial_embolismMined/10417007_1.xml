<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the incident, the cabin pressure increased to 8 in Hg (203.2 mm Hg, 27 kPa) above atmospheric pressure causing intense pain in the ears of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the crew inside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The system was rapidly depressurized to ground level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the incident, one of the crew reported chest discomfort and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The next morning, he developed a sensation of numbness in the left hand, with persistence of the earlier symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second crewmember, who only experienced earache and heaviness in the head after the incident, developed retrosternal chest discomfort, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and numbness in his left hand the next morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both were subsequently referred to a recompression facility 4 d after the incident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Examination by the Diving Medical Officer on duty recorded left-sided hemianesthesia and Grade II middle ear barotrauma as the only abnormalities in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chest X-rays did not reveal any extra-alveolar gas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of Static Neurological Decompression Illness were made and both patients recompressed on a RN 62 table </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The first case recovered fully after two treatments, and the second case after one treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and bubble contrast echocardiography performed on the first case 6 mo after the incident were reported to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The second case was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Decompression illness (DCI) generally occurs in occupational groups such as compressed air workers, divers, aviators, and astronauts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is believed to be the first report of DCI occurring among aircraft's ground maintenance crew </plain></SENT>
