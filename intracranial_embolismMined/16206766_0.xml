<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study of 62 patients with femur intertrochanteric fractures treated with PFN from October 2001 to September 2003 was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data of operative time, blood loss, intraoperative complications, wound drainage, postoperative complications, healing time, and hip function were recorded and compared with previous literature so as to evaluate the effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up for 8-22 month (13.6 months on average) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative fracture occurred again in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneous</z:hpo> ossification occurred in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hip varus occurred in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extra hip anteversion occurred in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of other cases was satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The operative time was 76.5+/-29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>1 min, the mean blood loss was 385.7+/-98.4 ml, the wound drainage was 45.5+/-21.7 ml, and the healing time was 13.2+/-3.8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to the Sanders post-trauma hip function assessing system, the excellent and good rate was 89.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The application of PFN is characterized by short operative time, less blood loss, stable fixation, so it is an effective way to treat femur intertrochanteric fracture in the old </plain></SENT>
