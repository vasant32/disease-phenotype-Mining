<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The experiments were performed to determine if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor, could reduce albumin extravasation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in some models of blood-brain barrier dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The blood pressure was increased by i.v. <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3092">bicuculline</z:chebi> in conscious rats with indwelling catheters in the aorta and jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>125I-labeled serum albumin and Evans blue-albumin were used as tracers of the blood-brain barrier function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> significantly reduced albumin extravasation after the administration of adrenalin but not after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3092">bicuculline</z:chebi>, i.e. when <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was combined with a metabolically mediated cerebral vasodilatation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is argued that the protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> probably is related to the vasoconstrictory effect of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five microliters of air or Lipiodol were injected into the right internal carotid artery in rats anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7983">pentobarbitone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The albumin content in the injected hemisphere was seven to nine times higher after fat than after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant reduction of tracer extravasation was obtained in rats treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rats subjected to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> had a significant homolateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> (i.e. increased water content) which was not reduced by pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the water content was significantly increased also in the non-injected side in rats given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> indicating a larger spread of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> fluid in these animals </plain></SENT>
