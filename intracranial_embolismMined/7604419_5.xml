<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and frequency of cerebral embolic signals in a patient population with the same mechanical heart valve using transcranial Doppler examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it aimed to identify patient and valve characteristics that correlated with the occurrence of these signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-two patients with Carbomedics valves and 15 healthy control subjects took part in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients were examined before and immediately after valve implantation (group 1), 34 patients 1 year after surgery (group 2), and 22 patients 5 years after surgery (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral embolic signals were detected using transcranial Doppler monitoring of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Asymptomatic cerebral embolic signals were detected in 87% of the total 92 patients, in 77.8% of group 1 patients, in 91.2% of group 2 patients, and in 95.5% of group 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No cerebral embolic signals were detected in group 1 patients before surgery or in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence (P = .04) and frequency (P = .002) of cerebral embolic signals increased significantly with longer duration of valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation was also found between frequency of cerebral embolic signals and valve size (r = .4326, P = .00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median frequency of embolic signals in patients with a history suggestive of cerebrovascular events (n = 14) was 60 signals per hour compared with 11 signals per hour in those with no such history (n = 42; P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and frequency of cerebral embolic signals increased with the duration of valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of these signals also was dependent on valve size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients who had experienced cerebrovascular symptoms had a higher frequency of cerebral embolic signals compared with those with no such signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results should be interpreted with caution but suggest that this method could be of help in assessing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in prosthetic heart valve patients and that prospective clinical studies should now be carried out </plain></SENT>
