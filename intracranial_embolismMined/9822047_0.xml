<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to find out the mechanism of genesis of contrast echoes detected with echocardiography during percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy (PMBC) procedures with Inoue balloons and to assess their association with cerebral microembolic signals with transcranial Doppler examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten Inoue balloons (Toray Instruments) were used in 10 patients (mean age 36 +/- 10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients transesophageal echocardiographies with a multiplane 5 MHz probe were performed immediately before and during the PMBC procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> during the PMBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the balloons were inflated within the left atriums and left ventricles and were tested in saline to see whether there was a visible air leak after the PMBC procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler examinations were done with 2 MHz probes from the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrast echoes were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during inflation and/or deflation, independent of the intracardiac sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a few cardiac cycles there was a very intense shower of microembolic signals detected with the transcranial Doppler examination, which persisted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inflations and/or deflations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> balloons yielded visible air leaks from the two small holes at the waist of the balloons in saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were a few contrast echoes recorded in some of the patients during the exchange of equipment, and one patient had a transient neurologic and coronary ischemic event following the introduction of the stretcher tube of the Inoue balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracardiac contrast echoes and transcranial microembolic signals during the PMBC procedure were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PMBC procedures and were due to air that was entrapped between the two latex layers of the Inoue balloons and air introduced from outside during the exchange of the equipment </plain></SENT>
