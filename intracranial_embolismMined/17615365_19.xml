<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrovascular events are related to atherosclerotic disease in the carotid arteries and are frequently caused by rupture of a vulnerable plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These ruptures are often observed at the upstream region of the plaque, where the wall shear stress (WSS) is considered to be highest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High WSS is known for its influence on many processes affecting tissue regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until now, there have been no serial studies showing the relationship between plaque rupture and WSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Summary of Case- We investigated a serial MRI data set of a 67-year-old woman with a plaque in the carotid artery at baseline and an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> at 10-month follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lumen, plaque components (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>/necrotic core, intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> were segmented and the lumen contours at baseline were used for WSS calculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation of the change in plaque composition with the WSS at baseline showed that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was generated exclusively at the high WSS location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this serial MRI study, we found plaque ulceration at the high WSS location of a protruding plaque in the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that high WSS influences plaque vulnerability and therefore may become a potential parameter for predicting future events </plain></SENT>
