<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Information on the mechanism of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may help physicians treating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms of recurrence in each <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype are not well known, especially in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the mechanisms of the index and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Analysis of data from a prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Using the clinical syndrome, diffusion-weighted imaging, and vascular studies, we divided 901 patients into 5 groups: large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, cardioembolism, small-artery disease, parent-artery disease occluding the deep perforators, and no determined cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were subdivided into 2 groups: intracranial and extracranial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The mechanisms of recurrent vascular events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>) in subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-three recurrent vascular events (86 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 7 instances of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pattern of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> differed for the intracranial and extracranial groups; unlike the patients with intracranial large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the extracranial group were often unpredictable with respect to the site of recurrence and degree of preexisting stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in the extracranial group had recurrences that were caused by intracranial large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with small-artery disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with no determined cause, intracranial stenosis was often found at the time of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From prognostic and therapeutic perspectives, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> should be divided into those with intracranial large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and extracranial large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, intracranial large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may be important in the development of small-artery disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with no determined cause, especially in the population with a higher frequency of intracranial large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
