<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (10 neonates, 15 children) with cerebral venous thromboses diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography over a 10-year period were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two groups were analyzed separately because of their differing modes of presentation and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of neonates presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and the outcomes were unfavorable in more than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> usually was associated with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic illness</z:e>, such as shock or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In comparison, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was the most common mode of presentation in the older children (excluding infants) and their outcomes generally were favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> in this group usually occurred in the setting of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> or an infectious process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both groups, global or focal neurologic findings on initial examination unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> correlated with the presence of an infarction on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infants and children with infarction due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> often had persistent neurologic disability at subsequent examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No sequelae were observed in those children and neonates only with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or with superficial venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment for both groups was conservative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient was anticoagulated specifically for the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The good outcomes in most patients suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anticoagulation may not be indicated </plain></SENT>
