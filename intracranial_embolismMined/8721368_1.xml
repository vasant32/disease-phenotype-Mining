<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 58-year-old woman was addmited to our hospital because of repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed a left <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> to be considered as the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the operation, 3 <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> were found in the left atrium, and were removed successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No recurrence has been observed for 14 years after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three years after that, her 3rd child, 31-year-old-women, suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and was also diagnosed as a left <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A friable <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> was removed with the interatrial septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She had no recurrence for 11 years after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxoma</z:hpo> who have unusual biologic behavior, including familial <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp>, "complex" type <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> must be suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that it is important to distinguish patients with "complex" type <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp>, because the recurrence rate is much higher in those than in patients with "<z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>" type <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
