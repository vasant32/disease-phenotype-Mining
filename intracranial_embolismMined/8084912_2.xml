<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated parietal cortex (PCTX) involvement in learning a shock-motivated, 14-unit T-maize in young F344 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 1, each rat was placed into a stereotaxic instrument, and the scalp was retracted before either the photosensitive dye, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>, or saline (CON) was provided via a jugular catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 60 s, <z:chebi fb="62" ids="24473">halogen</z:chebi> lamps were used to illuminate the cranium bilaterally over PCTX for 40 min to activate the dye and generate a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in dye-injected rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active avoidance pretraining in a straight runway occurred 12 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each rat was provided acquisition (ACQ) trials in the 14-unit T-maze 24-h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PCTX rats were impaired relative to CON in errors, run time, alternation errors, and shock frequency measures in the 14-unit T-maze, but not in shock duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> extended to areas comprising anteromedial and posterior PCTX, and also into the striate cortex (SCTX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 2, rats were divided into four groups: a PCTX group that received bilateral illumination; PCTX+SCTX and SCTX groups that were illuminated at midline; and a CON group that received the surgery and either dye or illumination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only PCTX differed from CON, with maze performance similar to Experiment 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> for the PCTX group in Experiment 2 was confined to anteromedial and posterior PCTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, PCTX, but not SCTX, was implicated in ACQ of this maze task, suggesting that PCTX might be involved in the robust age-related impairments in ACQ previously observed </plain></SENT>
