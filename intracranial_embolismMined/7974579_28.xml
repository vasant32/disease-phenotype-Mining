<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between embolization and specific events of bypass surgery is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With this technique, 20 patients undergoing bypass surgery were continuously monitored from inception to discontinuation of bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Embolic signals were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> embolic signals, 34% were detected as aortic cross-clamps were removed, and another 24% as aortic partial occlusion clamps were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 5% were detected at inception of bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates for embolization were 15.15 embolic signals per minute at cross-clamp removal, 10.9 embolic signals per minute at partial occlusion clamp removal, and fewer than 3 embolic signals per minute at other times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation was found between the number of emboli, severity of aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo>, and neurocognitive deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of emboli detected during coronary artery bypass grafting are associated with the release of clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clamp manipulation may lead to release of aortic atheromatous debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These emboli may be relevant to neurocognitive outcome </plain></SENT>
