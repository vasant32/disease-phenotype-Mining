<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this report is to quantify the amount of spontaneous microembolism detected in brain vessels by transcranial Doppler (TCD) during transcatheter closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 29 patients who had had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (17 females and 12 males; mean age 45+/-15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent TCD monitoring during the procedure and microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detection of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was distributed as follows: during femoral catheterisation in 8 patients (25%), during atrial catheterisation in 5 patients (17%), during transeptal crossing in 14 patients (48%), during left disc opening in 28 patients (96%) and during right disc opening in 7 patients (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest rates of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were observed during left disc opening and less during transeptal crossing with an average count of 31 (range 3-135) and 3 (range 1-18) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain embolism</z:e> occurs throughout the procedure after femoral catheterisation for <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the majority of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> reached the brain during the opening of the left disc in the left atrium: 28/29 patients exhibited <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> with an average of 31 (3-135), thus supporting the notion that gas embolism accounted for the findings </plain></SENT>
