<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A drug delivery system using copoly(lactic/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17497">glycolic acid</z:chebi>) was developed for the intracranial administration of papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rod-shaped implant prepared by a heat compression method was tested to determine its efficacy in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen dogs were randomly assigned to one of two groups, i.e., placebo or papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control angiography was performed, followed by right craniectomy and the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> by the placement of a clot in the Sylvian fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two pellets, containing either 25 mg of papaverine or no papaverine, were placed in the cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In in vitro studies, 56% of the actual papaverine loading was released in the first 4 days and 78% within 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On Day 7, angiography was repeated and the animals were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar experiment using low-dose pellets containing 5 mg of papaverine, half of which was released within 7 days, was performed with 16 mongrel dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant differences between the papaverine- and placebo-treated groups in the reductions of vessel diameters of the internal carotid, middle cerebral, and anterior cerebral arteries on the clot side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean concentration of papaverine in the clot was 4.5 x 10(-4) mol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The low-dose pellet failed to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, although the mean concentration of papaverine in the clot was 2.3 x 10(-5) mol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A prolonged-release preparation of papaverine that could be implanted intracranially at the time of surgery prevented vasospasm significantly while maintaining an appropriate concentration of papaverine in the cistern </plain></SENT>
