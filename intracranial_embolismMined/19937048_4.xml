<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of 64-multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) for the evaluation of aortic atherosclerotic disease (AAD), a potential source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, has recently been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the significance of AAD by using MDCT in patients who are suspected to have had embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> clinically or radiologically but without evident cardioembolic source (possibly embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or PES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 5/2007 to 10/2007, patients who were presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, met predefined criteria for PES, and underwent MDCT, were found in a prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry (PES group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-risk AAD was defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, ulceration, and a &gt;or=4 mm thickness of atherosclerotic plaque in the ascending aorta and aortic arch on MDCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For comparison, patients who were hospitalized due to non-embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (NES) during the study period and who underwent MDCT for the purpose of screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> were selected (NES group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among a total of 336 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 57 (20.0%) satisfied the criteria for PES, and MDCT was performed in 50 of these 57 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-hundred six patients were selected as the NES group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PES group had significantly higher prevalence of high-risk AAD than the NES group did (38.0 vs. 13.2%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of high-risk AAD was 4.03 (95% confidence interval, 1.81-8.98) and this result remained significant after adjustment for risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study suggests the etiologic role of aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> detected by MDCT in patients who are assumed to have had embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but without evident embolic source </plain></SENT>
