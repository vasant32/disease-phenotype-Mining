<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>Atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) is a rare heart defect regarded as a source of arterial emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main objective of the study was to assess the role of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in the etiology of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-eight subjects were included after transthoracic echocardiography positive for <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical history of embolic events was obtained in 13 patients (14.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnitude, location, size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, oscillation, direction of bulging, the presence of interatrial shunt and source of any potential cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> material were assessed, and the size of the left atrium, the area of both atria, and the presence of any valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> syndrome were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or flutter and the presence of concomitant diseases and other clinical features were also estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The occurrence of arterial emboli was not related to <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coexisting diseases, smoking and left atrial dimension were significantly correlated with the occurrence of arterial emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic events were not significantly correlated with the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest other causes of vascular events in patients with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
