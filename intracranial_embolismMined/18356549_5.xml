<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Characteristics of ultrasound-activated gaseous microspheres (muS) reflective of their size and quantities are needed for future dose-escalation and drug delivery trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A double-blind, interobserver-validated analysis of multi-gate power-motion Doppler microS traces included large (&gt;8 micro) microS from agitated saline injections in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and small (&lt;5 micro) microS from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> patients without shunts receiving thrombolysis and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31980">perflutren</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> microS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 101 microS traces from 50 RLS-positive and 10 thrombolysis+microS treated patients, a large microS passage had median maximum duration 30.8 ms (interquartile range [IQR] 22.0 ms), multi-gate travel time (MGTT) 58.6+/-19.3 ms versus small microS: duration 8.3 ms (IQR 4.3 ms), MGTT 43.2+/-13.9 ms, P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Small microS had higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>-to-blood ratio (EBR): 17.5 (IQR 9.3) versus 7.5 (IQR 4), P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating curve areas were: duration 0.989 (95% CI 0.968 to 1.000), MGTT 0.766 (0.672 to 0.859), and EBR (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>Embolus</z:mpath>-to-Blood Ratio) 0.927 (0.871 to 0.982), P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 15.1-ms duration discriminated size ranges with 98% to 99% accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On average, 130 sequential large (range 51 to 260) and 500 (265-588) small microS can produce continuous flow enhancement for 4 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small microS velocities on m-mode in obstructed vessels (39.8+/-11.3 cm/s) were similar to large microS in patent vessels (40.8+/-11.5 cm/s; P=0.719) and higher than surrounding red blood cell velocities (28.8+/-13.8 cm/s, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or reduced flow, activated muS passage duration through a small power motion Doppler gate can quantify the dose of delivered microS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound can determine a minimum number of microS needed to achieve constant flow enhancement and targeted drug delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Propagation speed of microS smaller than red blood cells may reflect plasma flow velocities around <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusions </plain></SENT>
