<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorders</z:e> in 103 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, we examined the predictive value of affective, cognitive, social and neurologic variables obtained in-hospital and at six months poststroke in terms of outcome as determined by the same measures at one and two years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following factors were found to have prognostic significance: 1) Lesion Location: proximity of the lesion on CT scan to the frontal pole in patients with left anterior <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> showed a strong positive relationship with severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at one year but not at two years poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2) Affective Status: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (in-hospital and at 6 months) strongly predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at one year but not at two years poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> significantly correlated with physical impairment at two years, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at six months bore a moderate relationship to physical impairment at one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3) Physical Impairment: impairment in activities of daily living in-hospital bore a modest relationship to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at one year while such impairment at six months correlated strongly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at both one and two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings may reflect the natural course of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> which remits between one and two years poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion location is the strongest predictor of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, there appears to be a reciprocal relationship between physical impairment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> predicts impairment and impairment predicts <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> are amenable to therapeutic intervention, these prognostic factors may have implications for the treatment and rehabilitation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
