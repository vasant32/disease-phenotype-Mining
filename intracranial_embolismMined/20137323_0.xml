<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From April 1992 to November 2008, 1768 patients underwent PBMV in our hospital.Clinical and echocardiographic follow up data were analyzed in 426 patients from April 1992 to August 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Left atrial pressure and the mitral valve gradient (MVG) were measured before and immediately after PBMV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PBMV was successful in 1748 out of 1768 patients (98.86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left atrial pressure decreased from (38 +/- 7) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) to (12 +/- 4) mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001), MVG decreased from (28 +/- 6) mm Hg to (8 +/- 3) mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001) and the area of the mitral valve increased from (0.98 +/- 0.26) cm(2) to (1.97 +/- 0.39) cm(2) (P &lt; 0.001) post PBMV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> (n = 1), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (n = 12), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (n = 2) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten years follow up was finished in 426 patients and 288 patients (67.6%) were still in NYHA class Ior II without mitral valve replace operation or repeated PBMV, restenosis was evidenced in 140 patients (33.3%) and 31 patients dead (7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PBMV was an effective therapy option for patients with rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral valve stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
