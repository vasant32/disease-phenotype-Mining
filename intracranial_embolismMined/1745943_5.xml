<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MEDUNSA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Data Bank (MSDB) was established in 1984 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its goal is to gather data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects of cerebrovascular disease in South African blacks, and it is supported by modern investigative techniques such as computed tomography (utilised in 82.2% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients (71.2%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Certain features, such as the importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and increasing age as risk factors, were found to be similar to Western <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> populations; also, probable or definite cardiac source for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was present in 46% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, however, other features, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, occurred far less frequently than is reported in Western patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that the MSDB will lead to a better understanding of cerebrovascular disease in blacks and possibly to in-depth comparative studies of the ubiquitous problem of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
