<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic value of drugs that antagonize <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>'s effects are being investigated in <z:mp ids='MP_0006080'>CNS ischemia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the efficacy of a noncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, MK-801 [(+)-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten- 5,10-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24783">imine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37156">hydrogen maleate</z:chebi>], in reducing ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We explored the limits of this therapy and different properties of MK-801 that might be involved in its neuroprotective actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two focal <z:mp ids='MP_0006080'>CNS ischemia</z:mp> models were used, a multiple cerebral embolic model (MCEM) and a rabbit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> model (RSCIM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When animals were treated 5 minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of injury, MK-801 was effective in reducing ischemic damage in both models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when treatment was delayed 10 minutes after the ischemic insult in the MCEM, no neuroprotection was observed even when the MK-801 dose was increased eightfold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also did not find a beneficial effect of MK-801 pretreatment with a dose that was one tenth of the effective dose in the RSCIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies using the (-) MK-801 isomer showed that MK-801 neuroprotection exhibited stereoselectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The contribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> activity and sedation to MK-801's neuroprotective actions was examined indirectly using phenytoin and midazolam, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither drug was effective in reducing ischemic injury in the MCEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that MK-801's neuroprotective efficacy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is mediated through its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> activity independent of its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> or sedative properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that excessive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor excitation may be involved in ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
