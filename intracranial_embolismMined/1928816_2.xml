<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The erythrocyte aggregation was assessed by light transmission aggregometer, and aggregation was induced by hexadimethrine-<z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased erythrocyte aggregation was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with thrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> showed a marked increase in erythrocyte aggregation as compared with those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> on erythrocyte aggregation was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> inhibited aggregation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An inhibitory effect was shown to be dose dependent, with 10 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> inhibiting aggregation completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After four weeks' oral administration of 200 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>, there was significant decrease of abnormally increased erythrocyte aggregation in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
