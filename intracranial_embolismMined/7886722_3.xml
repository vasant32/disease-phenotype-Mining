<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, the feasibility of automated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection by means of a neuronal network was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 25 patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, single transcranial Doppler monitoring sessions of 30 minutes' duration were recorded on videotape, randomized, and subsequently analyzed by eight independent trained observers from three centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three observers evaluated these tapes on three separate occasions, blinded to their previous results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional 48 patients with prosthetic heart valves were repetitively monitored with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography for 30 minutes three times within 1 year to examine the long-term variability in the occurrence of microembolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, in an effort to assess the short-term intrasubject variability, 20 patients were examined for 90 minutes, and the results of the three 30-minute periods were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interobserver, intraobserver, and intrasubject (both short- and long-term) variability was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences in microembolic signal counts were found among the different observers, between the human observers and the neuronal network, or among the three separate evaluations of stored data by the same observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same was true for repeat examinations of the same patient (P &gt; .05, Student's two-paired t test and Friedman's test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The detection of microembolic signals in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves is a reproducible technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reliable performance of the neuronal network argues for a broader use of this device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intrasubject stability of the microembolic rate over 1 year supports the concept that the underlying emboligenic process is associated with intrinsic mechanical properties of the valve implant and not due to a thromboembolic process in the heart </plain></SENT>
