<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Vein of Galen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is a rare congenital anomaly of cerebral circulation and occurs mainly in newborns and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spontaneously thrombosed vein of Galen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is especially rare and an uncommonly reported event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two patients with a spontaneously thrombosed vein of Galen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were operated on at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT and MRI demonstrated space-occupying lesions of the pineal region and two other masses in the posterior fossa in the second case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first described case should be referred to as the true type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vascular malformation, revealed in the second case should be referred to as the false type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this case the vein of Galen was enlarged to a gigantic size due to the blood drainage from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> supplying it from the inferior posterior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: Thrombosed aneurysmal sacs were resected totally by subtentorial supracerebellar and median suboccipital approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The authors report two cases of successful surgical resection of a thrombosed vein of Galen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic features are considered and the informative value of magnetic resonance imaging is stressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The principles of choosing the right approach and dissection techniques of thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vein of Galen are described </plain></SENT>
