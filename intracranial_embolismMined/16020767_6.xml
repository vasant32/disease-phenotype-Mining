<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound can reliably detect both gaseous and solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, conventional equipment is unable to discriminate between gaseous and solid emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a major limitation in situations in which the 2 coexist, because they may have very different clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, a novel Embo-Dop system, using insonation at 2 ultrasound transducer frequencies, has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An initial study with a small sample size suggested it provided excellent discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed a validation study in subjects with embolic signals of known nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gaseous embolic signals were obtained in 7 patients with known patient foramen ovale by intravenous injection of agitated saline injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Solid embolic signals were obtained in patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (N=23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Discrimination of the 2 using the Embo-Dop system dual-frequency system was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was compared with discrimination using embolic signal maximum intensity with an intensity threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred forty-five solid embolic signals were recorded from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three were classified as solid and 72 as gaseous by the Embo-Dop system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six hundred forty-eight gaseous embolic signals were recorded from 7 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six hundred twenty-five were classified as gaseous and 23 as solid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This gave a sensitivity of 50.3% and specificity of 96.5% for detecting solid embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Discrimination was better than using a simple intensity threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Embo-Dop dual-frequency system allows better discrimination than a simple intensity threshold but it is not accurate enough for use in clinical or research studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed to develop reliable clinical systems for discrimination of emboli </plain></SENT>
