<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing frequency or severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> or a change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> pattern were the usual reasons for referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities were found in 37 cases and fell into 4 categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent (21 cases) consisted of a mild degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in the white matter of one or both cerebral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was usually bi-frontal (15 patients) but was more extensive in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Varying degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, as determined by widening of the Sylvian, brain-stem and interhemispheric cisterns, and/or widening of the third and lateral ventricles as compared to a group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scans, was found in 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Areas of occipital infarction were found in 4 patients with permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpected small areas of infarction were found in the temporal lobe in 2 other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263885" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cerebral tumours</z:e> were found in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significance of these findings is discussed, as well as the possible role of migrainous vaso-spasm with consequent changes in cerebral blood flow in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
