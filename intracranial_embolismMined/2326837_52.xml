<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Group 1 (n = 53) patients had no clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo>, and group 2 (n = 19) patients had abnormal cardiac findings upon clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In group 1, precordial echocardiography detected an abnormality in only one patient (aortic valve thickening) but transesophageal echocardiography defined morphologic abnormalities in five patients (one with a left atrial appendage mass lesion, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, one with a mitral leaflet mass lesion, and one with aortic valve thickening) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group 2, both precordial and transesophageal echocardiographic studies were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 13 patients, while both were abnormal in the remaining six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of these six patients had pathologic left atrial and/or left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo>, but only transesophageal echocardiography defined a left atrial appendage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in two of the six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sixth patient had mitral chordal rupture, seen on both precordial and transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in 32 of the 72 patients transesophageal echocardiography identified widespread thoracic aortic atherosclerotic plaques not visualized by precordial echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that transesophageal echocardiography significantly increases the yield in visualizing potential intracardiac sources of emboli compared with precordial echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the precise clinical value of the former in the management of such patients requires further study as the number of abnormal transesophageal echocardiographic findings is not high and a causative relation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> cannot be proven </plain></SENT>
