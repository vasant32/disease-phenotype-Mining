<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe 5 patients who underwent major head and neck procedures not requiring carotid ligation and who postoperatively suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These occurred between the first and ninth postoperative days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of the patients were thought to have had emboli, 3 to the cerebral hemispheres (2 ipsilateral and 1 contralateral to the neck dissections), and another to the lower brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypoperfusion was thought to have caused the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the fifth patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cases in our series were difficult to diagnose because of the delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and subtle nature of symptoms, as well as masking of speech and communication due to the operative involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombogenesis within the internal carotid and vertebral artery systems due to patient positioning and intraoperative cervical manipulation may be an important etiologic factor in this form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
