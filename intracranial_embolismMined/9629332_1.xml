<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty nine patients (20 men and 9 women) between 25 and 79 years old were studied; they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have had a atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were classified into two groups according to the result of their carotid doppler ultrasonography: gl-without carotid flow reduction (n = 19) and g2-with carotid flow reduction (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fibrinogen mean value was 269 mg/dl in gl and 353 mg/dl in g2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 47% of patients in gl and 80% of patients in g2 who presented levels &gt; 300 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportions of the groups were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering the epidemiological value of 300 mg/dl, we conclude that the fibrinogen can be an independent risk factor for ischemic atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, specially in those whose carotid flow is reduced </plain></SENT>
