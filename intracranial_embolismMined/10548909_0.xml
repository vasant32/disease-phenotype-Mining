<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HACP usually resulted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in the basis pontis at the junction of the upper one-third and inferior two-third of the pons, or in the posterior limb of the internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reported a patient with HACP which was caused by an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the paracentral gyrus irrigated by the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001317'>cerebellar signs</z:hpo> before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of HACP, although he had old small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the right pons, right thalamus and left cerebellar hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging and other clinical studies suggested that the mechanism of the present infarction was the most-likely embolic, but not lacunar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As far as we know, there has been only one abstract presentation of a patient with HACP due to ACA territory infarction in Japan, although five such cases were recently reported by Bogousslavsky and others </plain></SENT>
