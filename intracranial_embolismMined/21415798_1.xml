<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospectively controlled trial was to determine whether increased mean blood flow velocity in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> by intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during carotid dissection in CEA prevented postoperative development of new cerebral ischemic lesions caused by intraoperative microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with ipsilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (&gt;70%) underwent CEA under transcranial Doppler monitoring of mean blood flow velocity and microembolic signals in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Attempts were made to keep systolic blood pressure during carotid dissection between -10% and +10% of the preoperative value (controls, n = 65) or above a +10% increase (intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group, n = 65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence of new ischemic lesions on postoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was significantly lower in the intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group both for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (controls, 15.4%; intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group, 3.1%; P = .03) and in a subgroup of 37 patients showing microembolic signals during carotid dissection (controls, 52.6%; intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group, 11.1%; P = .013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis demonstrated the absence of intentional hyperperfusion (95% confidence interval: 1.77-100.00; P = .012) and high number of microembolic signals (95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.62; P = .05) during carotid dissection were significant independent predictors of the postoperative development of new ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> mean blood flow velocity by intentional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during dissection of the carotid artery in CEA prevents the postoperative development of new cerebral ischemic lesions caused by intraoperative microemboli </plain></SENT>
