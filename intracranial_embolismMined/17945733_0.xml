<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> can be prevented by lifestyle/dietary changes and pharmacological treatments if identified early by monitoring carotid plaque changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sensitive monitoring of plaque changes in volume and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> requires that 3D ultrasound (US) images of carotid plaque obtained at different time points be registered and evaluated for change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This registration technique should be non-rigid, since different head positions in image acquisitions cause relative bending and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> in the neck, producing non-linear deformations between the images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We modeled the movement of the neck using a "twisting and bending model" with only six parameters for non-rigid registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a Mutual Information (MI) based image similarity measure with the Powell optimization method as they have been used effectively in US image registration applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For evaluation of our algorithm, we acquired 3D US carotid images from three subjects at two different head positions to simulate images acquired at different times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then, we registered each image set using our "twisting bending model" based non-rigid registration algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We calculated the Mean Registration Error (MRE) between the segmented vessel surfaces in the target image and the registered image using a distance-based error metric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We repeated the experiment with only rigid registration to compare the capabilities of the proposed algorithm in improving registration of 3D carotid US images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average registration error was 1.03+/-0.23 mm using our non-rigid registration technique, while it was 1.50+/-0.50 mm when we applied the rigid registration alone </plain></SENT>
