<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of 72 carotid endarterectomy operations carried out by three consultant surgeons were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight operations (32.8 per cent) were performed in patients with mild or resolving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 33 operations (45.9 per cent) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients (7 per cent) died in the early postoperative period, 2 as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and the others from cardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six per cent of patients had a satisfactory long term result, remaining free from storke, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> or recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> over the follow-up period of 1--7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 10 patients (13.8 per cent), including 2 who died, who developed early postoperative neurological deficits; 4 (5.5 per cent) had transient defects and 6 (8.3 per cent) had permanent deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 4 had proved occlusions of the reconstructed artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, cerebral embolization during operation was suspected as the cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were, in addition, 2 asymptomatic patients whose reconstruction was shown to be occluded on follow-up postoperative angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The continued absence of symptoms, therefore, is no guarantee that the reconstruction is patent and some more objective method of assessment is necessary if the results of carotid endarterectomy are to be critically analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of neurological deficits could, it is believed, be reduced by greater experience with the operation, the routine use of peroperative intra-arterial shunting and peroperative angiography to confirm the patency of the reconstruction </plain></SENT>
