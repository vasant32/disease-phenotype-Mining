<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, the decision times of vocal recognition responses from aphasic (left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) patients did not correlate with their verbal scores on the Porch Index of Communicative Ability, taken as an estimate of severity of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, impairment of verbal processing was not reflected in speed of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, 19 left and 19 right-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were compared with 19 volunteers on a recurrent recognition task of complex nonverbal art designs using measures of discriminability and decision bias derived from Theory of Signal Detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients had lowest recognition scores but adopted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> decision criteria, whereas left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients employed high negative decision bias (i.e., made few false as well as few correct recognitions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups responded significantly slower than controls; the right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, however, had markedly fewer long-latency decisions than left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, only the speed and bias of decision making were deficient in left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients independent of their verbal deficit; their recognition ability was relatively preserved </plain></SENT>
