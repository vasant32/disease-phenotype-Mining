<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the changes in risk factor effects on the incidence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as they may occur with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Findings were based on repeated risk factor measurements at four examinations over a 26-year period in 7589 men in the Honolulu Heart Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After each examination, 6 years of follow-up were available to assess risk factor effects on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> over a broad range of ages (45-93 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As compared with normotensive men, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> declined from a 7-fold excess in men aged 45 to 54 years to a 1.4-fold excess in men aged &gt; or =75 (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> seemed to be equally important across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, whereas a protective effect of physical activity increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except for men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> increased significantly with age regardless of risk factor status, including men with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although hemorrhagic events were less common, positive relations with cigarette smoking seemed to strengthen with age, whereas those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> tended to decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that strategies for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may need to account for changes in risk factor effects as they occur with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the encouragement of active lifestyles in the elderly seem to be especially important </plain></SENT>
