<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, there are no reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) series in which detailed long-term follow-up results after radiosurgery were described based on the whole patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We performed a detailed long-term follow-up study of 53 patients with cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> treated with gamma knife (GK) radiosurgery, with emphasis on radiation-related adverse effects detected on neuro-imaging after a long post-irradiation latency period (3-10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The post-GK follow-up period was 40-232 months excluding two mortalities, the mean being 112 and the median being 111 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients (5.6%) have, as yet, refused <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neuro-imaging follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete nidus obliteration was confirmed angiographically in 32 patients (60.4%) between 1 and 5 post-GK years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the other 18 patients (34%), despite significant nidus shrinkage being angiographically demonstrated, complete obliteration was not achieved during a 2-7 year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were two mortalities, one <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>-related (massive re-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during the latency period) and the other angiography-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were five radiation-related morbidities (9.4%), three of which-hemi-Parkinson syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, and visual field disturbances attributable to delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> formation-manifested at 5.5, 7 and 7 post-GK years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also experienced five patients (9.4%) in whom, despite remaining asymptomatic to date, radiation-related adverse effects were seen on neuro-imaging: middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> at 3 post-GK years in one patient; dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> at 7 post GK-years in one; delayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> formation in two, at 5 and 10 post-GK years; and a small cavitation at 9 post-GK years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up, particularly with neuro-imaging modalities, is essential even after the "treatment goal" has been attained </plain></SENT>
