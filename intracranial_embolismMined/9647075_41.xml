<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autopsy brain specimens of patients after cardiac operations with CPB reveal numerous acellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> deposits (10 to 70 microm) in the microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that these small capillary and arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> result from a diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to CPB or from emboli delivered by the bypass circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine which aspect of CPB is most clearly associated with these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen dogs were studied in four groups: group I (n = 3), right-heart CPB; group II (n = 2), lower-extremity CPB; group III (n = 3), hypothermic CPB; and group IV (n = 5), hypothermic CPB with cardiotomy suction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> dogs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were maintained on CPB for 60 minutes and then euthanized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain specimens were harvested, fixed in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, embedded in celloidin, and stained with the alkaline phosphate histochemical technique so that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> could be counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> dogs completed the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean density of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> per square centimeter for each group was as follows: group I, 1.77 +/- 0.77; group II, 4.17 +/- 1.65; group III, 4.54 +/- 1.69; and group IV, 46.5 +/- 14.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group IV (cardiotomy suction), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> density was significantly higher than in group III (hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass) (p = 0.04) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Blood aspirated from the surgical field and subsequently reinfused into dogs undergoing CPB produces a greater density of small capillary and arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> than CPB without cardiotomy suction, presumably because of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> microembolization </plain></SENT>
