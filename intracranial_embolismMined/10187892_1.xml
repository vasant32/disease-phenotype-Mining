<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) can detect circulating microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We focused our attention on tail signs (TS), a signal associated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> that appeared as a small reversal signal after <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> on the high time resolution spectral display </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and artifacts in an animal study to determine whether TS were specific changes associated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and investigated the characteristics of TS in both animal and clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an animal study, adult pigs with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and minimal anticoagulation therapy were used as a model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After performing TCD monitoring with a multigated approach, we did an offline analysis to investigate several parameters concerning <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and TS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also examined TS in patients in a clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a total of 362 MES investigated in the animal study, 72.9% were followed by TS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We could not find any TS associated with artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time delay between TS and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was negatively correlated with the velocity of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> almost always appeared first in the proximal channel, whereas TS conversely appeared first in the distal channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the clinical study, we were also able to observe TS associated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TS may represent emboli passing down a branch vessel or twisted downstream vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TS are specific for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and can be used as another criterion for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> identification </plain></SENT>
