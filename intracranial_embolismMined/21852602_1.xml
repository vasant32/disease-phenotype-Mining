<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are frequent in high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> and are thought to result from hemodynamic impairment, particularly when adopting a rosary-like pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a role for microembolism has also been suggested, though never directly tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the relationships among microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) on transcranial Doppler, rosary-like deep watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on brain imaging, and cerebral hemodynamic compromise on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in severe symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that rosary-like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> would be significantly associated with worse hemodynamic status, independent of the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen patients with â‰¥70% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> ipsilateral to recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>/minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> underwent magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging, (15)O-PET, and transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean transit time, a specific marker for hemodynamic impairment, was obtained in the symptomatic and unaffected hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven of 16 patients had rosary-like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (Rosary+) and 8 patients had <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean transit time was significantly higher (P=0.008) in Rosary+ patients than in healthy controls (n=10), and prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was not different between Rosary+ and Rosary- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contrary to our hypothesis, however, the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> within the Rosary+ subset was associated (P=0.03) with a better hemodynamic status than in their absence, with a significant (P=0.02) negative correlation between mean transit time and rate of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to mainstream understanding, rosary-like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were not independent of presence and rate of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, suggesting that microembolism plays a role in their pathogenesis, probably in association with hemodynamic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pending confirmation in a larger sample, these findings have management implications for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> and rosary-like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
