<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the last three years 20 consecutive patients with supratentorial <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> were examined by intra-operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> in order to evaluate the potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> to 1) localize the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, 2) differentiate between embolized and perfused parts, 3) identify feeding and draining vessels and 4) control the complete excision of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> were localized supratentorially, 9 were grade I and II (according to Spetzler and Martin [31]), 8 grade III and 3 grade IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>11 were partly embolized and 8 associated with an <z:mp ids='MP_0001916'>intracerebral bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the nidus was correctly localized sonographically by its typical bidirectional flow pattern in Colour-mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> guided the surgeon directly to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (11 cases) deep-seated <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> (2 to 4 cm subcortically) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The smallest nidus measured 10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>28 of 34 angiographically defined main feeding and 18 of 23 draining vessels were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>14 patients were controlled sonographically at the end of the resection regarding the completeness of excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> was negative and was confirmed by either postoperative angiography or MRI in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one case residual <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> tissue was missed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> findings in 3 cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> confirmed by microscopic re-inspection, angiography and CCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> is able to localize <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> intra-operatively with minimal instrumentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It allows safe navigation to deep-seated malformations with high accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Feeding and draining vessels can be identified and completeness of resection can be controlled </plain></SENT>
