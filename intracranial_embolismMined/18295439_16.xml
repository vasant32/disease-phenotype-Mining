<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The use of a distal filter cerebral protection device with carotid artery stenting is commonplace </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is little evidence, however, that filters are effective in preventing embolic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the incidence of embolic phenomenon during carotid artery stenting with and without filter use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, single-center study of carotid artery stenting with or without a distal cerebral protection filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 1:1 scheme was used to randomize 36 carotid artery stenting procedures in 35 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW MRI) 24 hours after stenting was used to assess the occurrence of new embolic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blinded observers calculated lesion number and volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 78.6 +/- 7.0 in the cerebral protection group compared with 74.1 +/- 8.7 in the no cerebral protection group (P = .92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite similar average age, the percentage of octogenarians was higher in the cerebral protection group (61.1% vs 22.2%; P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two procedures in the cerebral protection group were not successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One was completed without protection because of inability to track the filter, and the second was aborted because of severe tortuosity with a later carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New MRI lesions were noted in 72% of the cerebral protection group compared with 44% in the no cerebral protection group (P = .09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The average number of lesions in these patients was 6.1 and 6.2, respectively, with mean DW MRI lesion size of 16.63 mm(3) vs 15.61 mm(3) (P = .79 and .49, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred (11%), two in each group, in patients aged 75, 80, 82, and 84 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The only major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in the no cerebral protection group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of filters during carotid artery stenting provided no demonstrable reduction of microemboli, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Routine use of cerebral protection filters should undergo a more critical assessment before mandatory universal adoption </plain></SENT>
