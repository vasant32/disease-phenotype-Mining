<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>"Traumatic late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">apoplexy</z:e>" is a sudden cerebrovascular attack subsequent to traumatic cerebral lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to Bollinger's concept, on which the term "traumatic late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">apoplexy</z:e>" is based, this process was always a cerebral haemorrhage following trauma and appearing several days or weeks after the accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the discussions which followed after Bollinger had introduced this concept, the time sequence of this incident was fixed and the interval between trauma and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">apoplexy</z:e> defined as occurring between the 6th day and the 8th week after the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, cerebrovascular disease would have to be excluded; if this condition could not be verified with reasonable certainty, the patient would have to be at least less than 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> always had to be "established" morphologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This concept and this definition were extended a few decades later on the basis of progress made in the knowledge and treatment of cerebrovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was found that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> need not be confined to haemorrhages only; every other traumatic cerebral lesion could be included which resulted in "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">apoplexy</z:e>" in the clinical sense of the term with some delay after the trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this article includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> modern concepts on such processes and discusses the various types of traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> which can occur in our present technological age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reports published in literature are scrutinised and analysed more closely, and guidelines and hints are given which can be helpful in expertising work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The list of references is very extensive </plain></SENT>
