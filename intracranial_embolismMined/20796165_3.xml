<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> after catheter-based closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) can be related to residual RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To improve closure success, we need a better understanding of the anatomic and device-related factors associated with closure efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with cryptogenic neurologic events and severe RLS (Valsalva Spencer transcranial Doppler [TCD] grade 5/5+) who underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) closure by either central pin (Amplatzer(®) <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> [A-<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>]) or central occluding (Amplatzer(®) SO [A-SO]) devices were evaluated for residual shunt by quantitative TCD evaluation at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings were correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>), device type, and device size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We closed 628 consecutive patients with either the A-<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> (n = 327) or A-SO (n = 301) device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of large defects, small defects, and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was 12%, 88%, and 44% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe residual shunt was detected in 13% of A-<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and 7% of A-SO recipients (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference was attributable to a much higher frequency of severe residual shunt among patients with large defects closed with the A-<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> compared to the A-SO device (12 out of 29 [41%] vs. 3 out of 42 [7%], respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in device failure frequency for small defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> increased the frequency of severe residual shunt compared to those without this feature (36 out of 275 [13%] vs. 28 out of 353 [8%], respectively; P = 0.046) but did not influence device-related differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) Both noncentering and central occluding closure devices effectively reduce RLS after <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(2) Large <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> defects with or without <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> have lower residual shunt grades at 3 months when closed by central occluding devices </plain></SENT>
