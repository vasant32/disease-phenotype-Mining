<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated two fibrinolytic agents, an analogue of tissue plasminogen activator (Fb-Fb-CF, the catalytic fragment of the tissue plasminogen activator molecule with a prolonged serum half-life, n = 10) and streptokinase (n = 7), in a rabbit model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both agents were given 3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, a time relevant to the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fb-Fb-CF was significantly better (p less than 0.04) than saline (n = 7) in restoring blood flow to previously occluded intracranial arteries, but streptokinase was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither fibrinolytic agent was associated with a substantial risk for intracerebral hemorrhagic side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that Fb-Fb-CF can safely and effectively reperfuse rabbit intracranial arteries 3 hours after occlusion, while streptokinase does not </plain></SENT>
