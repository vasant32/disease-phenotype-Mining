<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery is hyperdense on computed tomography in cases with basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied computed tomography attenuation values before and after contrast administration in a total population of 117 patients, 12 of whom were diagnosed angiographically as having basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While it is not always possible to detect basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> simply by evaluation of the tomodensitometric values before or after contrast, the differential values obtained by subtracting them (after contrast/before), or by an attenuation ratio corresponding to the differential value divided by the value before contrast, are more helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the differential values and attenuation ratios in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population have a mean value of 51.1 and 1.37 compared with 14.47 and 0.33 in patients with basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
