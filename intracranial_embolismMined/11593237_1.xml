<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively performed bilateral multigated transcranial doppler monitoring from both middle cerebral arteries in 359 patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or recent (&lt;4 weeks) cerebral ischaemic event, and in 182 control subjects without a cerebral ischaemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were analysed according to the standardised protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with cerebral ischaemic events had a significantly higher (p&lt;0.00001) rate of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> occurrence (31.8%) than control subjects (5.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected significantly higher in patients with partial or total anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (39.1%) than in those with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (26.0%) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (27.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A correlation of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and neuroimaging finding was also tried </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCD was found to have a predictive role in microemboli monitoring, predominantly in patients with large vessel territory infarction </plain></SENT>
