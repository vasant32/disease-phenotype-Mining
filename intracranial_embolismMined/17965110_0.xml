<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We disclose the safety of this isolation technique by measuring cerebral oxygenation and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients underwent total arch replacement using SCP since 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The isolation technique was applied in sixteen patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjO(2)) was monitored in nine patients undergoing isolation technique (isolation-group) and in thirteen patients of the rest (conventional-group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oxygen, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> extraction ratio (OER, GER, and LER) were measured at seven time points peri-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The isolation-group had significantly longer SCP time (isolation: 185+/-52 min vs. conventional: 140+/-43 min, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During cooling, SjO(2) was kept comparable between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OER was minimum at the end of cooling and comparable between groups (isolation: 3.8+/-7.7% vs. conventional: 11.7+/-13.8%, P=0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in GER and LER between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were neither in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Temporary neurological dysfunction was observed only in conventional-group (n=3, 23%, P=0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Isolation technique for total arch replacement could be performed safely and may provide acceptable results in patients at high risk for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
