<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1540912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hypereosinophilic syndrome</z:e> (HES) who initially presented with recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0347950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">asthmatic attacks</z:e> followed by progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006536'>obstructive lung disease</z:hpo> was suspected at first although involvement of cardiac and other organ systems and marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> eventually led to the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thereafter a diffuse interstitial pattern gradually developed on the chest radiograph which persisted despite vigorous treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was due to infiltration and cuffing of the small pulmonary arteries by eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bronchi showed changes consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Review of the literature indicates that this type of vascular change is common in HES but involves predominantly organs other than the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar pulmonary arterial changes have been produced experimentally in the calf by prolonged intravenous infusion of antibiotics, indicating that this may be a hypersensitivity reaction to a blood-borne material entering the pulmonary circulation </plain></SENT>
