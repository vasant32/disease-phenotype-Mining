<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The term evanescent, or vanishing, has been used to describe those intracranial stenoses that are consecutive to the partial recanalization of an embolic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In general terms it has been admitted that those stenoses quickly disappear in parallel to the complete recanalization of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This behaviour allows their differentiation from the atherosclerotic stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We present here a 61-year-old male who suffered a middle cerebral artery territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> secondary to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, a stenotic flow was found in the proximal portion of his left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although it was an embolic occlusion, one year passed before the stenosis disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Findings like this contradict the protocols in use (which consider a stenosis as atherosclerotic if it remains for more than three months), and stress the need for new studies which clarify the natural history of the intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
