<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A monitoring of both middle cerebral arteries using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was performed to investigate cerebral microemboli during LHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients undergoing LHC and 29 patients with LHC followed by coronary intervention were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a standardized LHC (n = 52), 95 +/- 45 MES were detected of which 67.5% occurred during injection of contrast media or saline solution, 30% during movements of wire and catheter, and 2% during catheter manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During coronary interventions only, rotablation (n = 2) was followed by a massive increase in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of injection fluids prepared with minor gas content reduced the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> rate by 67% (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were clinically silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral microembolism is a current finding during LHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dependence of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> rate during diagnostic LHC on the gas content of the injection fluids provides evidence that most of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> are caused by microbubbles and not by solid emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high rate of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during coronary rotablation may be explained by the formation of cavitation bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical results of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during LHC appear to be benign </plain></SENT>
