<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been proposed that the novel spin trap agent disodium-[(tert-butylimino)<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-1,3-disulfonate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35580">N-oxide</z:chebi> (NXY-059) may be useful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is little information concerning the neuroprotective properties of NXY-059 when administered after an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there is no information available concerning the combination of NXY-059 with the only Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacological agent for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we determined the effects of NXY-059G, a generic form of NXY-059, on behavioral outcome after an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> when administered alone or in combination with tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male New Zealand White rabbits were embolized by injecting a suspension of small blood clots into cerebral circulation via a carotid catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NXY-059G (100 mg/kg) was infused intravenously 5 minutes or 3 hours after embolization, whereas control rabbits received infusions of the saline vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In tPA studies, the thrombolytic was administered intravenously starting 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization (3.3 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In combination studies, NXY-059G was given 5 minutes after embolization, followed by the administration of tPA beginning either 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Behavioral analysis was conducted 24 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the vehicle control group, the ES50 value (calculated as the amount of microclots [milligrams] that produce neurological dysfunction [impairment] in 50% of the rabbits within a specific treatment group) measured 24 hours after embolism was 1.04+/-0.31 mg, and this was increased by 153% to 2.54+/-0.72 mg if NXY-059G was administered beginning 5 minutes after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, if NXY-059G was administered beginning 3 hours after embolization, the ES50 was 2.01+/-0.40 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rabbits treated with tPA alone had an ES50 of 2.64+/-0.66 or 0.63+/-0.35 mg if tPA administration started 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If tPA was administered after NXY-059G (started at 5 minutes), the ES50 values were 3.15+/-0.50 or 2.66+/-0.82 if tPA administration started 60 minutes or 3 hours after embolization, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that NXY-059G is neuroprotective and can increase behavioral ratings if administered early after an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, the study shows that NXY-059G can be used in combination with tPA without negative side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The drug combination can improve behavioral function and increase ES50 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, during the short time course of the behavioral analysis, the combination was not statistically better than either drug alone </plain></SENT>
