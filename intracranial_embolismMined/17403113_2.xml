<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: alpha(2)-Macroglobulin (alpha2MG) is a broad-spectrum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> that is known to neutralize alpha-thrombin, plasmin, and activated protein C, which suggests that it has <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> as well as procoagulant properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to evaluate the role of alpha2MG in children with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> [VTE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: alpha2MG levels measured after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> VTE <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in white patients were compared with data obtained from age- and gender-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, to compare the rate of elevated alpha2MG and prothrombotic risk factors [factor V G1691A, prothrombin G20210A, raised <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a)] between patients and controls and to evaluate the interaction between elevated alpha2MG levels and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo>, odds ratios (ORs) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model was adjusted for age and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: alpha2MG levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls (320/139-524 vs. 302/109-406; P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients (IS n = 103; DVT n = 92), the risk of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was significantly increased with elevated alpha2MG levels, with a gradual increase per mg dL(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, when elevated alpha2MG levels &gt; 90th percentile were compared with values below the cut-off, including established prothrombotic risk factors in the multivariate analysis, patients had a significantly increased OR/95% CI for fibrinogen-adjusted alpha2MG levels (IS, 5.9/1.9-18.3; DVT, 7.2/2.1-24.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The procoagulant properties of elevated alpha2MG levels independently increase the odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and DVT in white children </plain></SENT>
