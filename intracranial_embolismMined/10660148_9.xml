<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of 374 consecutive patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were collected from a prospective hospital-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry in which 2000 patients are included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distinctive clinical features of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the very elderly were assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were diagnosed in 39 (15%) of the 262 very elderly patients of our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the very elderly accounted for 10.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference in the occurrence of different lacunar syndromes between the very elderly patients and patients below 85 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the very old group with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> showed a significantly higher proportion of the female sex (56.4% vs 37.3%) and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (28.2% vs 8.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> and pathologic condition and a significantly lower proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (61.5% vs 77.3%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (7.7%) vs 28.4%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, and absence of neurologic deficit at discharge from the hospital than patients below 85 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariate analysis only <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (OR = 3.77), female gender (OR =2.52), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR = 0.35), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR = 0.16) were independent clinical factors for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in the very elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the very elderly the higher occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, the lower prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the greater focal neurological impairment suggest that the cardioembolic pathogenetic mechanisms may be more frequent than generally established for lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
