<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HITS identified as embolic signals were detected in 29 of 124 (23.3%) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HITS were more common in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> on the same side as high-degree (&gt; 70%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> (24 of 57 = 42.2%) compared with low-degree (&lt; 70%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> (5 of 28 = 17.9%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No HITS were detected in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> on the same side as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (24) and occluded (15) carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>About the clinical features related to the stenoses, HITS were detected with a nonsignificant prevalence in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> on the same side as symptomatic stenoses (16 of 43 = 37.2%) compared with asymptomatic stenoses (13 of 42 = 30.9%) and a relationship between HITS number and time elapsed from symptoms was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> &gt; 70% (33) underwent endarterectomy and none of them showed HITS after surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results encourage the feasibility of prognostic studies to evaluate the clinical significance of embolic signals and suggest that silent microembolism could be helpful in selecting a high-risk group of asymptomatic or &lt; 70% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> for endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
