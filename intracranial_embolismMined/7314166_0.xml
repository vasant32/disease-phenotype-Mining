<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reasons behind these unpredictable consequences were sought in the interaction, in vitro and in an animal model, between the main <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> components of advanced plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pure preparations of representative <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were each harmless when embolized into the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, combinations in proportions similar to those in advanced human plaques caused infarction, whether these were synthetic mixtures or extracts from plaques of the entire <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most important physical interaction between the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> was aggregation of crystals by oils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between cholesterol and the mainly liquid <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi>, this created in vitro a range of glutinous aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">Triglyceride</z:chebi> lowered the melting point of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi>, increasing their oiliness, and reduced the cohesiveness of aggregates in the face of operative mechanical forces through a fall in viscosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">Phospholipid</z:chebi>, acting principally as an emulsifying agent, promoted dispersion of the oil, secondarily freeing the crystals from its aggregating effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the plaque, the balance of these factors will determine the size and number of particles likely to embolize, and, therefore, the clinical outcome should the plaque rupture </plain></SENT>
