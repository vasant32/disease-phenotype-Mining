<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to investigate the association between perioperative cerebral microembolization, expressed as high-intensity transient signals (HITS) and postoperative dynamics of the neuromarker S100P in patients operated using cardiopulmonary bypass, and to assess their impact upon the neurocognitive function in the early postoperative stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study involved 62 consecutive male patients aged 60 or above, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>alls</z:hpo> scheduled for elective aortocoronary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were recruited from two groups with respect to the use of CPB: on-pump group (CPB+, N = 30) and off-pump group (CPB-, N = 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients we performed intraoperative monitoring of cerebral haemodynamics using transcranial Doppler, with the goal of quantifying perioperative cerebral microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of the neuromarker S100l were measured immediately after surgery, and then 12, 24 and 48 hours after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitive status was assessed before and after the surgery and in three cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of the study have shown that with respect to the short-term postoperative neurocognitive outcome there is no significant difference between the on-pump and off-pump surgical technique of coronary revascularization' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perioperative cerebral microembolization was significantly more pronounced in the on-pump group yet it did not affect early postoperative neurocognitive function, while the increase in the neuromarker S100beta serum level 48 hours after surgery may have prognostic value as a predictor of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
