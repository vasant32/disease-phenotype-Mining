<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-four rats were trained in appropriate cognitive and motor behaviours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen animals were sham-operated and fifty-nine animals were embolized in the right carotid territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly assigned to five groups: 1) SHAM (non-embolized, saline), 2) CONTROL (embolized, saline), 3) D-AMPH (embolized, D-amph), 4) THERAPY (embolized, saline + physical therapy) and 5) D-AMPH + THERAPY (embolized, D-amph + physical therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats of the groups 4-5 underwent d-amph or saline treatment on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after surgery and were re-trained for 1 h starting 60 min after each treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During this time, rats were allowed to voluntarily engage in suitable cognitive or motor behaviours in order to obtain food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were re-tested during days 21-28 after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were observed between the groups of embolized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When evaluating performances on days 21-28 after surgery, rats of the SHAM and THERAPY groups had better fine motor performance than those of the CONTROL (P &lt; 0.05), whereas rats of SHAM and D-AMPH groups achieved better cognitive performance than CONTROL rats (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between any groups regarding gross motor performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After embolization, physical therapy improved fine motor performance and D-amph accelerated rehabilitation of cognitive performance as observed in the rats of the THERAPY and D-AMPH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a result of the administration of a high dose of D-amph, the rats of the D-AMPH + THERAPY combination group failed to engage in physical therapy during D-amph intoxication, thereby limiting any promotion of rehabilitation by combining physical therapy and D-amph </plain></SENT>
