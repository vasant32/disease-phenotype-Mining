<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically detectable neurologic deficits resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> are reported to occur at a frequency of 0.0056% per patient-month with the Thermo Cardiosystems Heartmate 1000 (Woburn, MA) intraperitoneal LVAD (TCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, the occurrence of asymptomatic cerebral microemboli in patients with this device has not been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial doppler (TCD) monitorings were used for evaluation of the incidence of cerebral microembolism in 14 patients with the TCI LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were performed after LVAD support ranging from 7 to 305 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 35 studies were obtained from the left middle cerebral artery for a duration of 30 minutes per study and the number of high intensity transient signals (HITS) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient with a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, an average of 0.86 HITS per study period (0.03/min) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients without any symptoms, an average of 0.46 HITS per study (0.016/min) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, no HITS were determined in 74% of the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical significance or the nature of these microemboli is unknown, the data support that microembolism with the TCI LVAD is a rare event despite absence of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term detailed neurocognitive testing and hematologic assessment is needed to establish the clinical relevance of these microemboli in patients with detected signals </plain></SENT>
