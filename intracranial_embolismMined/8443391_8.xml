<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel variant of antithrombin III (AT III) that lacks affinity for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was found in a 33-year-old man who suffered from recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The propositus had a history of recurrent ischemic attacks from the age of 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and had a smoking habit (30 to 40 cigarettes/day), low <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> as the possible risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No family history of thromboembolic episodes was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coagulation studies found low <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor activity (55%) of AT III, with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immunoreactive level (109.7%) and progressive antithrombin activity (117%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other factors capable of predisposing him to hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis by crossed immunoelectrophoresis in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and affinity chromatography on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> demonstrated that the propositus' AT III was composed of two populations, one having no affinity for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and the other binding <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequencing of 7 exons of the propositus' AT III gene using polymerase chain reaction and subcloning disclosed a transition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> in exon 3a (codon 116) of the AT III gene leading to a Ser116-Pro conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization procedures confirmed the presence of the mutation in the propositus' genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using the same technique, the mutation was also found in his father's genomic DNA, but not in that of his mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that Ser116 is an important amino acid residue in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding and that the propositus is heterozygous for the abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the fact that the propositus suffered from recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> suggested that being heterozygous for a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-binding defect would lead to a predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> when associated with various risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The name AT III Nagasaki is proposed for this variant AT III containing a novel Ser116-Pro mutation </plain></SENT>
