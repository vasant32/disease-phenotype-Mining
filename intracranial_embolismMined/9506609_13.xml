<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High-intensity transient signals (HITS) during cardiac surgery are capable of causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine whether intraoperative HITS cause alterations of neuropsychological function (NPF) and/or cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (CMRGlc), even in a low-risk patient group, and whether induced changes are interrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients without signs of cerebrovascular disease underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and two of these additionally underwent valve replacement in normothermia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively, HITS were recorded by means of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perioperatively, NPF and CMRGlc were assessed using a standardized complex test battery and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> (FDG-PET), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraoperatively, the number of HITS ranged from 90 to 1710 per patient and hemisphere, more on the right side than on the left (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HITS occurred primarily during cardiopulmonary bypass (71.3%) and, to a lesser extent, during aortic manipulation (22.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in global and regional CMRGlc between first (one day preoperatively) and second (8 to 12 days postoperatively) FDG-PET scans were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlations were found between the number of HITS, age of patient, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> or cardiopulmonary bypass and the changes in CMRGlc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with recorded HITS and a postoperative decrease of regional CMRGlc (n=11), the maximal decrease of rCMR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17234">Glc</z:chebi> in each hemisphere below the individual global change of CMRGlc correlated with the number of HITS (r= -0.46, P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Limitations in NPF occurred 8 to 12 days postoperatively, resolved within 3 months, and were not found to be correlated to the absolute number of HITS or changes in CMRGlc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HITS during cardiac surgery can cause alterations of both NPF and CMRGlc, even in a low-risk patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the number of HITS and changes in NPF and CMRGlc are not necessarily interrelated, which indicates that (1) the location of brain damage related to HITS is more important for the development of NPF than is the absolute number of HITS, and (2) factors in addition to HITS might contribute to surgery-related brain damage </plain></SENT>
