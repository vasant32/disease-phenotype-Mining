<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transfemoral selective arterial catheterization was performed in most of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A radiolucent operating table was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and a radiolucent head-holder in most </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five of the 57 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> procedures, clip repositioning was required after intraoperative angiography demonstrated an inadequate result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five of the 48 <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> procedures, intraoperative angiography demonstrated residual <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> nidus which was then located and resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two cases intraoperative angiography failed to identify residual filling of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> which was seen later on postoperative angiography, and in one case the intraoperative study failed to demonstrate a tiny residual fragment of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> which was seen on conventional postoperative angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two complications resulted from intraoperative angiography: one patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> from cerebral embolization and one patient developed leg <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> from femoral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique appears to be of particular value in the treatment of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> and vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
