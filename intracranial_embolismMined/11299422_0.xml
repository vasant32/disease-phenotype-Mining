<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and neurologic complications in CABG with and without CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients eligible to routine CABG without CPB were randomized to surgery with CPB and without CPB and continuously monitored by transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic examination was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two groups were similar with respect to demographics, risk factors, grade of aortic atheromatous disease and number of grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the nonCPB group was considerably lower than in CPB patients, however, we did not observe any change in the neurologic examination during the early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications after CABG may be related to the size and composition of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> rather than to their absolute numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A large prospective multicentric randomized trial may help to elucidate this complex issue </plain></SENT>
