<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine predictors of in-hospital mortality in 231 consecutive patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by means of a multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three predictive models were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A first model was based on demographic, anamnestic and clinical variables collected at the bedside examination (total 8 variables) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second model was based on clinical and neuroimaging variables (total 10 variables) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A third model was based on the aforementioned clinical and neuroimaging variables and the presence of early recurrent embolism (total 11 variables) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deteriorated level of consciousness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo>, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, male gender, and age appeared to be independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality in the predictive model based on clinical variables and in the predictive model based on clinical and neuroimaging variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to these variables, early recurrent embolization was selected in the third predictive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the first two models, setting a cut-off point of 0.50 for predicting vital status at hospital discharge resulted in a sensitivity of 60%, a specificity of 89% and a total correct classification of 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values of the third model were 62, 89 and 81%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data may help clinicians to establish an early prognosis of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype more accurately as well as to allocate patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in clinical trials correctly </plain></SENT>
