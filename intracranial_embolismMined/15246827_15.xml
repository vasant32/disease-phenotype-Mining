<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Currently, the only FDA-approved treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) is the thrombolytic, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; alteplase; activase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that both the spin trap agent NXY-059 (cerovive) and tenecteplase (TNK-tPA), which are currently in phase II clinical trials, may also be useful for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is little information available concerning the dose-response profiles or therapeutic window for NXY-059 in a validated embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, nor is there information available pertaining to the effects of combining NXY-059 with tenecteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we determined the pharmacological profile of NXY-059 on behavioral outcome following small clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in rabbits when administered alone or in combination with tenecteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male New Zealand white rabbits were embolized by injecting a suspension of small blood clots into cerebral circulation via a carotid catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NXY-059 (0.1-100 mg/kg) was infused intravenously (IV), 1 h following embolization, whereas control rabbits received infusions of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also determined the therapeutic window for NXY-059 by administering the drug 1, 3, or 6 h following embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lastly, in combination studies, NXY-059 was given concomitantly with tenecteplase 1 or 6 h following embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the vehicle control group, the P(50) value (milligrams of clots that produce behavioral deficits in 50% of the rabbits) measured 24 h following embolism was 1.20 +/- 0.15 mg, and this was increased by 100-134% if NXY-059 (1-100 mg/kg) was administered following embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If NXY-059 was administered beginning 3 or 6 h following embolization, there was no significant behavioral improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If NXY-059 (100 mg/kg) and tenecteplase (0.9 mg/kg) were administered concomitantly 1 h postembolization, we did not measure any additional behavioral improvement compared to either drug alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, if the drugs were administered 6 h following embolization, we measured a statistically significant reduction of behavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study shows that NXY-059 is neuroprotective over a wide range if administered early following an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, the study shows that NXY-059 can be administered in combination with tenecteplase to provide additional behavioral improvement at extended delays following embolization </plain></SENT>
