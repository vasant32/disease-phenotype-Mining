<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> coil occlusion rate (OR) is the strongest available predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standard clinical subjective occlusion rating (SOR) is limited by subjective bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, computerized occlusion rating (COR) was introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its superiority was established for experimental and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present clinical study, we aimed to evaluate COR as a risk factor for postprocedural reruptures (PPRs) and intraprocedural reruptures (IPRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our series of 249 consecutive patients treated in our institution, we observed 7 (2.8%) cases with IPR and 7 (2.8%) cases with PPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients were analyzed in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean COR value was 85% (range 71-96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 12 (85.7%) cases, COR was lower than SOR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with a COR of 95% or higher, no PPR occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with IPR harbored multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In -conclusion, our data showed a distinct tendency of potentially dangerous overestimations when using SOR compared to the objectively measured COR values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>IPR was always associated with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
