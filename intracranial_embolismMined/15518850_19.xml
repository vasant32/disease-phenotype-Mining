<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decompressive craniectomy is an effective treatment, but patient selection, timing, functional recovery, and complications remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-one patients with massive embolic hemispheric infarctions (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume &gt;200 cm(3)) associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> were retrospectively divided into 3 groups according to the therapeutic modalities: 21 patients were treated conservatively (conservative group); 50 patients were treated by external decompressive craniectomy with duroplasty in 2 groups; 29 patients treated after the appearance of clinical and radiologic findings of brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> (late surgery group); and 21 patients treated before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> (early surgery group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mortality at 1 and 6 months in the conservative group were 61.9% and 71.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality at 1 and 6 months in the late surgery group were significantly improved to 17.2% and 27.6%, respectively, (p &lt; 0.01) and in the early surgery group were further improved to 4.8% and 19.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The functional recovery of the patients was estimated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Barthel Index (BI) at 6 months after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GOS scores of the early surgery group were significantly better than that of the late surgery group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean BI score of the survivors in the late surgery group (26.9 +/- 30.4) was not significantly different from that of the conservative group (28.3 +/- 42.2), but was significantly improved in the early surgery group (52.9 +/- 34.2) compared with the late surgery group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early decompressive craniectomy with duroplasty before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> should be performed to achieve satisfactory functional recovery if the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> is more than 200 cm(3) and computed tomography on the second day after the ictus shows mass effect </plain></SENT>
