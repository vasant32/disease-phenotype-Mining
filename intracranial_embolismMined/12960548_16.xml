<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is not readily obvious whether an intravascular bubble will grow or shrink in a particular tissue bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This depends on the constituent gases initially present in the bubble, the surrounding tissue, and the delivered gas admixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors used a computational model based on the physics of gas exchange to predict cerebrovascular embolism behavior during <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors estimated values of gas transport parameters missing from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The computational model was used with those parameters to predict bubble size over time for a range of temperatures (18 degrees -39 degrees C) used during extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bubble size over time is highly nonlinearly dependent on multiple factors, including diffusivity, solubility, gas partial pressures, magnitude of concentration gradients, vessel diameter, and temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>- and oxygen-containing bubbles continue to grow during <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bubble volume doubles from 50 to 100 nl in approximately 3-68 min, depending on initial gas composition and bubble shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bubble growth and reabsorption are relatively insensitive to temperature in the physiologic and surgical range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi> anesthesia results in gas exchange conditions that favor bubble growth, which may worsen neurologic injury from gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The concentration gradients can be manipulated by discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> delivery to promote reabsorption of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-containing bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Estimated growth and reabsorption rates at normothermia can be applied to temperature extremes of cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
