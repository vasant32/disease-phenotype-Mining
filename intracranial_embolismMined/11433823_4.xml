<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no data exist comparing the impact of combined presence of both aortic plaques and MAC on embolic events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> or cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 100 consecutive patients with aortic plaques detected by transesophageal echocardiography (mean age 69.8 + 8.9 years, range 39-93 years, 49 males, 51 females) and in 49 age- and sex-matched control subjects (mean age 69.4 + 7.8 years, range 46-89 years, 27 males, 22 females) without aortic plaques (control group), the incidence of embolic events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> associated with embolic events and total cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were evaluated during a mean follow-up of 32 +/- 9.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of the presence or absence of MAC on these parameters was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control group, patients with aortic plaques had a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01), smoking history (p &lt; 0.01), MAC (p &lt; 0.00001) and the presence of atherosclerotic changes in the carotid arteries (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, patients with aortic plaques had a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.0001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.005) and total cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with both aortic plaques and presence of MAC had during the follow-up a significantly higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.0001, 16.0 times higher) and total cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.005, 4.7 times higher) compared with those without MAC and the presence of aortic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariant regression analysis showed MAC (p &lt; 0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) were the only independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAC (p &lt; 0.05) and age (p &lt; 0.000001) were the only independent predictors of total cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of both aortic plaques and MAC were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.00001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.005), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001), female gender (p &lt; 0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of both aortic plaque and mitral annular calcification are highly predictive not only for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, but also for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and total cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and are probably strong markers for higher severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They are more predictive if both are present simultaneously compared to the presence of either MAC or aortic plaque alone </plain></SENT>
