<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have been carried out in the last twenty years on the characterization and detection of cerebral artery emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From the detection point of view, the existing methods are largely based on the classical Fourier analysis of which the well known limitations provide poor accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper first recalls existing methods based on Fourier, Wigner-Ville and wavelet approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It then presents new emboli detection methods based on parametric signal processing approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basic idea of these parametric methods is to compare the Doppler embolic signal to its autoregressive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detection principle consists in constructing a decision information which contains the signature of the micro-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> being sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The detection is finally evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison between the new methods and classical approaches is performed using a realistic embolic signal simulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, to validate our theoretical study, we tested our new algorithms using in vivo signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This comparison shows the significant inaccuracy of existing methods to detect micro-emboli </plain></SENT>
