<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Follow-up imaging data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without angiographically apparent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> at symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our Emergency Management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (EMS) trial experience to determine the clinical and imaging outcomes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who showed no <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> on angiograms obtained within 4 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in this report were participants in the EMS trial that was designed to address the safety and potential efficacy of combined IV and intraarterial thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were randomized to receive either IV rt-PA (n = 17) or placebo (n = 18), followed by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> was evident in 10 (29%) of the 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight (80%) of 10 patients without angiographically apparent clot within 4 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> had a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> confirmed on follow-up brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median 72-hour infarction volume was 2.4 cc (range, 1-30 cc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of the 10 "no-clot" patients had a favorable 3-month outcome as assessed by Barthel Index (score, 95 or 100) and modified Rankin Scale (score, 0 or 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The six remaining patients had 3-month Rankin Scale scores of 1 (Barthel of 90), 2, 3, 4, or 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with a neurologic deficit but a negative angiogram during the first 4 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> usually develop image-documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and approximately half suffer from long-term functional disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The two most likely explanations for negative angiograms are very early irreversible ischemic damage despite recanalization or ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> secondary to clot in non-visible penetrating arterioles or in the microvasculature </plain></SENT>
