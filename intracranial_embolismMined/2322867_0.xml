<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The systems used currently for this task are particularly pneumatic systems that allow only a limited life comfort for the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore they have been used for short-term application as so-called bridge systems designed for periods preceding heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Artificial hearts should be available for such situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are antithrombogenic owing to their construction and material properties and thus the patient's central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system is not threatened by thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Czechoslovak artificial heart TNS-Brno-VII is optimal in this respect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In experiments lasting for months, however, microembolism into the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> from a calcified diaphragm often threatens the experimental animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This danger can be limited both by optimal construction of the pump and by affecting the calcifying mechanism biologically, or by suitable processing of the diaphragm material that prevents calcifying nucleation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perfect technology in the production of artificial hearts warrants complete elimination of potential <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> into the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore the aim of further research is to design an absolutely defect-free system of the artificial heart which would eliminate any damage to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system during permanent long-lasting application, either on the basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> of any origin, or on the basis of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> hypoperfusion caused by limited pumping function of the artificial heart </plain></SENT>
