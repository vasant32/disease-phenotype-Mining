<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic plaques are frequently found somewhat distal to the origin of the cerebral arteries, implying that cerebral embolization from such plaques depends on local retrograde blood flow components in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of blood flow reversal in this part of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since the presence and magnitude of retrograde flow might be influenced by aortic wall properties, we also studied the relationship between plaque size and distribution, aortic strain and degree of retrograde flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated aortic arch ante- and retrograde blood flow velocities in 56 patients by transesophageal echocardiography using color-Doppler-guided pulsed-Doppler techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The velocity-time integrals (VTI) were measured and the diastolic/systolic VTI ratio was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Retrograde diastolic blood flow was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, and diastolic/systolic VTI ratios were higher (p &lt; 0.05) in patients with plaque &gt;or=4 mm (n = 17) compared to those (n = 39) without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients exhibiting plaques exclusively in the aortic arch showed the highest VTI ratios (p &lt; 0.01) and tended to have the lowest strain values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic strain was also reduced in patients &gt;50 years of age (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate retrograde aortic flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects and its proportion increases in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, particularly in the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aortic plaques situated distally to the origin of the cerebral arteries are therefore possible sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
