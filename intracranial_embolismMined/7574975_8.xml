<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, the great majority are subclinical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant cases of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> are largely underdiagnosed, undertreated, and underreported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The management of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> has been challenged due to the lack of prospective, randomized studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preventive measures that have been implemented throughout the years, resulting from empirically acquired knowledge, have avoided frequent major mishaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perfusion accidents, in which massive amounts of gas are pumped into patients, are managed intraoperatively by common-sense heroic measures which, at best, remove 50% of the embolized gas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative confirmation of a neurologic insult after a cardiopulmonary bypass-assisted operation, in which a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is likely the source, is one of the most distressing situations a surgical team has to confront, due in part to the lack of pathognomonic diagnostic tools and to the absence of a "scientifically proven" (supported by prospective, randomized studies) therapeutic regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In lieu of the latter, we present the physical and physiologic bases that will justify the use of several therapeutic tools when facing a suspected CAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These tools, when applied rationally, will represent some of the most innocuous modalities in the medical armamentarium </plain></SENT>
