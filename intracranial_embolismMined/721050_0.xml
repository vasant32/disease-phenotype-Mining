<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition postoperative artificial ventilation is provided routinely in many centers for at least a few hours, until stabilization of cardio-circulatory and metabolic state is achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 4 groups (I-IV) with a total of 659 patients (18 to 72 years old) undergoing open cardiac surgery for acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (I: aortic valve, II: mitral valve, III: multivalvular disease, IV: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>) postoperative cardio-circulatory and pulmonary complication rate, duration of artificial ventilation needed, PaO2 and some influencing factors have been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group II and III show the highest rate of complications, 15.5 and 19.8% respectively, versus 7.7 and 8.1% in group I and IV respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of postoperative respiratory treatment in cases with complications within <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (133--156 h) is about 6 times the duration of respiratory treatment in the non complicated cases (23--24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 groups mean PaO2 at the time of extubation is lower for the complicated compared with the non complicated cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age of patients, severity of disease, preoperative pulmonary function, prolonged duration of ECC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> have been found to be predisposing factors for postoperative cardio-pulmonary complications, whereas the duration of anesthesia and the type of anesthesia do not show any influence </plain></SENT>
