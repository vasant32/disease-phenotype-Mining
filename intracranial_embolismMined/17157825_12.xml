<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to the determination of lesion size, the assessment of functional outcome may improve the value of this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were submitted to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> clot embolism or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to achieve a larger variety of lesion volume, 2 subgroups (each 7 animals) were subjected to differently sized emboli (30 and 40 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up period was 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome assessment consisted of a test battery including parallel bar crossing, observation of behaviour in an open field and an 8-arm maze and a neurological score with ten different sensorimotor and coordinative items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were perfusion-fixed on day 7 (blinded examination) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For both subgroups, there were significant impairments with regard to performance on the Neuro score, parallel bar crossing and maze exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvement was only partial during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On follow-up day 6, there was still a significant correlation between total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and functional outcome on the Neuro score (R=0.80, p=0.0006) and the exploration behaviour in the maze (R=0.66, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Application of emboli with a length of 40 mm caused more functional impairment and a more extended lesion volume compared with 30 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We present outcome tests that provide quantitative and objective tools to test functional impairment in rats following embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
