<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent epidemiological studies have suggested that 15 to 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is comprised of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> might prove to be the most reliable tool when making a diagnosis of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, although not always easy to determine even with recent advanced technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, sensitivities to detect intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac-enhanced CT (CCT) and scintigraphy with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-111-tropolone-labelled platelets (PSG) were compared, in order to provide a relevant guideline for the diagnosis of intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in 83 patients suspected of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also studied was the correlation of intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> with activation of platelets and coagulation-fibrinolysis through performing various hemostatic tests in order to investigate their utility for the evaluation of in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or prothrombotic state in the heart chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detection rates of intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were 35% in TEE, 26% in CCT, 19% in PSG, and 11% in TTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the sensitivity between TEE and TTE (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were frequently detected in TEE (4 out of 5 patients) and CCT (7 out of 10), while they were found less in PSG (2 out of 4) an TTE (4 out of 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombi</z:e> in the left appendage were visualized in 3 out of 3 by TEE, while only in 1 out of 3 by PSG, 1 out of 4 by TTE and 1 out of 4 by CCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>; CCT (3 out of 3), TTE (2 out of 3), PSG (1 out of 1); TEE was not performed since this technique could not be expected to provide high-quality images of left ventricular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were considered to be more sensitively detected by TEE and CCT, left appendage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> by TEE, and left ventricular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> by TTE and CCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no patient in whom an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> was visualized by PSG alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the results above, we propose the following guideline for the detection of intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in patients presented with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>First, TTE and CCT appear to be relevant for screening tests because of simple and non-invasive techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These two tools might be sensitive enough to find left ventricular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Second, TEE should be recommended when a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> is suspected in the left atrium or appendage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Finally, PSG may be used to determine the activity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, according to its necessity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Among the patients having intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, frequently observed was the increase of beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, platelet lysis, thrombin-antithrombin III complex, D-dimer in 67%, 75%, 71%, 80% and 80%, respectively, as well as the shortening of platelet survival in 100%, while anrithrombin III was reduced in only 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition, when hemostatic abnormalities were compared between positive and negative groups of intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, the shortening of platelet survival (p &lt; 0.0001), the increase of platelet lysis, and the increase of D-dimer (p &lt; 0.04) were more frequent in the positive group than in the negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the findings of activation of platelets and coagulation-fibrinolysis, except for the reduction of antithrombin III, especially the findings of platelet consumption and lysis as well as fibrinolysis activation are useful as sensitive parameters of in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or prothrombotic state, which may lead to the formation of intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
