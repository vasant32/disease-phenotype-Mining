<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our experience blood pressure variability has shown to be greater in thrombo-embolic, than haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This outcome contributes to explain literature disagreement on benefits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy and suggests the need for blood pressure monitoring in every trial, that wants to evaluate with satisfactory reliability the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary experience with a centrally acting antiadrenergic drug (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi>) has shown its ability not only to reduce blood pressure, but also blood pressure variability in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
