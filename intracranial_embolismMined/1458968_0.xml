<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Daily doses of 100 mg, 50 mg and 25 mg were administered to three groups of 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in platelet aggregation responses were dynamically observed in 64 (22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 42 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects revealed inhibition of platelet aggregation at a dose of 300 mg or 100 mg which could last as long as 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that 100 mg or less could be clinically effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups, with 14 patients in each group given daily doses of 100 mg, 50 mg and 25 mg during four weeks' observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most effective inhibition was obtained in the 50 mg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors recommend 50 mg/d as the optimal dosage for low dose aspirin therapy in geriatric patients </plain></SENT>
