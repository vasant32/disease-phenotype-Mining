<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the cases who were consulted due to perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From April, 2004 to March, 2007, a total of 102 patients were referred for neurological evaluation because of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Types of planned or performed surgery, risk factors, types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and timing of the events were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven cases were consulted preoperatively for history or risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven cases had ischemic risk factors and cerebral vascular recanalization was carried out in four patients who experienced severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other patients with ischemic risk factors were treated to avoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> perioperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine cases with hemorrhagic risk factors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo>, were treated to avoid significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The types of planned surgery were cardiovascular surgery in 29 cases, abdominal surgery in 13, cervical surgery in 7, and thoracic surgery in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Except for one case, who suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> due to cardiac surgery, those who were consulted preoperatively did not experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurological events had occurred in 35 patients and they were consulted postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedures were cardiovascular surgery in 19 patients, thoracic surgery in 6, abdominal surgery in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in 20 cases, hypoxic brain in 8, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cause of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was considered as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in 19 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Those who were consulted preoperatively were treated to prevent intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and did not suffer neurological complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most stoke in patients undergoing surgery were not related to hypoperfusion but due to embolism </plain></SENT>
