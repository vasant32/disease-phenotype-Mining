<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: By means of transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) representing embolic events can be registered during cardiac surgery and extracorporeal circulation in a considerable number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted the present study to determine the neuro-psychiatric consequences of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 25 patients scheduled for elective aorto-coronary bypass grafting (ACBG; n = 10) or aortic valve replacement (AVR; n = 15) were studied pre- and postoperatively with neuropsychiatric testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were related to the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> noted intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we registered the intraoperative changes of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, mean arterial pressure, arterial blood gases, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and haematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistics included t-test, two-way analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney-U-test and Spearman correlation with p &lt; 0.05 considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Regarding demographic data and intraoperative parameters, both study groups (ACBG vs. AVR) were comparable except for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AVR patients showed significantly more <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> than those undergoing ACBG (p &lt; 0.012) which was most pronounced in the late state of surgery (aortic clamp off; p &lt; 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts did not correlate with neuropsychiatric test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to recent reports, we were unable to show a deterioration of postoperative neuropsychiatric state related to high intraoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> count in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future TCD studies should focus on the differentiation between gaseous emboli and particles even in the clinical setting, as the latter may well play a major role for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> following cardiac surgery and extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
