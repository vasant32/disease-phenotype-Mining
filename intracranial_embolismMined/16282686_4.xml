<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the most predictive characteristics of arch atheroma, including maximal plaque thickness, for subsequent cardiovascular events, and also examined whether moderate atheroma&lt;4 mm is a risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The maximal plaque thickness (MPT) and plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> of the aortic arch were evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography in 236 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the relationship between the incidence of cardiovascular events, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and the characteristics of the atheroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the thickness of atheroma in patients with known causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=148) and in patients with undetermined causes (n=19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiovascular events occurred in 47 patients in the follow-up period with a mean of 3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MPT was a significant risk factor of the cardiovascular events, although plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the receiver operator characteristics curve analysis, the suitable cutoff point of MPT associated with the cardiovascular events was 3.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with MPT &gt;or=3.5 mm had a higher risk of cardiovascular events than did those with MPT&lt;3.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, aortic atheroma with MPT &gt;or=3.5 mm was more frequently observed in patients with undetermined causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than those with known causes at 68 vs. 39% (p=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:MPT &gt;or=3.5 mm is the best predictor of subsequent cardiovascular events and a possible cause of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
