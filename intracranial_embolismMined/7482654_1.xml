<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was conducted to explore whether intra-arterial infusion of phenytoin causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and to examine the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by phenytoin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten rats were infused with phenytoin (150 microL, 3.75 mg) retrogradely from the left external carotid artery, followed by perfusion of carbon black transcardially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The removed brain was photographed from above, and the nonperfused area was compared with control rats (n = 10) with the use of an image analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight animals with or without phenytoin treatment were perfusion-fixed for transmission electron microscopic analyses of cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of tissue plasminogen activator (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) on phenytoin-infused rat cerebrum, 20 rats were treated with or without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> (120,000 IU) 5 minutes after the phenytoin infusion (n = 10 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> 25 to 40 minutes after the injection and received carbon black transcardially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The nonperfused area was seen in the territory of the left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombi</z:e> were observed from arterioles to capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under electron microscopy, endothelial cells were partially exfoliated, and the vascular lumen was obstructed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> predominantly consisting of platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight rats with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> survived more than 60 minutes, whereas only 2 rats survived without the treatment (P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonperfused areas were 7 +/- 5% and 50 +/- 11% of cerebral surface area in rats with and without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> treatment, respectively (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterial infusion of phenytoin results in a nonperfused area in rat cerebrum primarily due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of arterioles and capillaries </plain></SENT>
