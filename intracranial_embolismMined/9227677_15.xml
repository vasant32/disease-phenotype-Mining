<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It remains uncertain whether the annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk of 7% to 8% in middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis is of embolic or hemodynamic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary reports provide evidence of emboli exiting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses, detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With multirange monitoring before and after the stenosis, TCD monitoring may help for the first time to differentiate microemboli exiting from the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis from those with a source proximal to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We searched for microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) using multigated monitoring in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with 78 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stenoses of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional sources of embolism were ruled out by extensive clinical workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi>, whereas 28 patients received aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 6 patients discontinued their medication after a few weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sample volume of the multirange probe was placed on either side of the stenotic area of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three (29.5%) of the stenoses were low grade, 18 (23%) were moderate, and 37 (47.5%) were severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven (47%) of the stenoses were symptomatic and 41 (53%) were asymptomatic before study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Computer tomography revealed two watershed-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sufficient insonation of the prestenotic and poststenotic segments of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was possible in 70 stenoses (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> could be detected during a total of 1740 minutes' monitoring time distal to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses, regardless of the patients' medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were also absent in the contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> are not detectable in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses of different degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were found in either symptomatic or asymptomatic stenoses, regardless of the patients' medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses do not represent a significant embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The absence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the prestenotic Doppler sample volume, the watershed-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> during follow-up, and the absence of small-vessel disease on computed tomography suggests that hemodynamic mechanisms are responsible for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
