<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions in cerebral GAD have also been found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (unipolar) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The GAD reductions did not generally appear to be localised in any specific region of the brain examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the reduction of CAT in the hippocampus, relative to reductions in other areas examined, was substantially greater in the brains with Alzheimer-type changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GAD and CAT activities in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brains were examined for the effects of some variable factors inherent in necropsy biochemical measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These factors included: (i) age; (ii) agonal status; (iii) time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and (iv) delay in tissue sampling; and GAD was found to be significantly influenced by (ii), (iii) and (iv) and CAT by (i), (iii) and (iv) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of these factors accounted for the total alterations in the enzyme activities of the mentally abnormal brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that reductions in cerebral GAD require to be interpreted with caution in view of the sensitivity of this enzyme to premortem status but that reductions in cerebral CAT may be a more reliable index of pathological change in senile (Alzheimer-type) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
