<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Controlled experiment sacrificing sheep after a period of simulated diving in a hyperbaric chamber and carrying out sequential postmortem computed tomography (CT) on the cadavers </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of gas in the vascular system of human cadavers following diving associated fatalities is to be expected, and is not necessarily connected with gas embolism following pulmonary barotrauma, as has previously been claimed </plain></SENT>
