<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether changes of neuronal properties can be observed in the unlesioned ipsilateral hippocampus following cortical photothrombosis in the somatosensory cortex of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to investigate calcium current properties of hippocampal neurons (CA1 and CA3) 7 days after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant alteration in the half-maximal potential of inactivation (V(h,i)) could be demonstrated, when comparing lesioned with sham operated animals, while other current parameters remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The alterations of the V(h,i) in the CA1 and CA3 regions were of opposite directions: V(h,i) in CA1 neurons was shifted negatively by 5.6 mV, and positively by 5.0 mV in neurons from the CA3 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has been speculated that these differential alterations may be due to different subunit compositions of calcium channels in these two brain areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that small cortical lesions can lead to widespread alterations of the neuronal network's excitability in the hippocampal formation </plain></SENT>
