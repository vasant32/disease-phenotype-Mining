<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were assigned to four study groups, according to clinical diagnosis supported by CT scan, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and reversible neurological deficit (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e>), or completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in the presence or absence respectively of antiplatelet medical treatment at the time of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant increase of the in vitro platelet aggregation was found in 44.4% of the untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e> patients and in 33.9% of the untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However this last group showed a higher percentage of very marked hyperaggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences between the two treated study groups and controls were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in collagen- and ristocetin-induced aggregation between the patient groups and the controls </plain></SENT>
