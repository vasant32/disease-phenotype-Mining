<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this situation, treatment is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A case of intracranial right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> in a 55-year-old woman presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is reported </plain></SENT>
