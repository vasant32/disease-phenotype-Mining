<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The echographic criteria selected for this study were the echo-inducing structure of the plaques; the relationship of the plaque with the artery wall (presence of a lesion continuous with the wall); the regular configuration of the endoluminal edge of the plaque or not; and finally, the notion of a discrepancy between the extent of the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> visualized by ultrasound and that observed with echography (E much less than U) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary results of this study demonstrate that echo-inducing, uniform and regular (36 cases) atheromatous plaques corresponded to ordinary, fibrous or calcified plaques in 69.4% of cases, with regular endoluminal borders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Irregular and non-uniform plaques (31 cases) suggested irregular, friable and/or ulcerated substance in 64.4% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poor echo-conducting plaques (9 cases) suggested formation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, basically, in 44.4% or of soft and friable plaques (33.3% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those plaques which were continuous with the wall do not correspond to a precise type of lesion but, rather, are characteristic (with poor echo-conducting plaques) of the embolic nature of the plaques (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The criteria echo much less than ultrasound is specific for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in 75% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> may also assume very diverse echographic presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, three negative echo-ultrasound results were observed in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
