<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A non operated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the anterior communicating artery enlarged considerably over a seven years period; it finally thrombosed and behaved like a suprasellar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical course, the angiographic evolution and the anatomical examination allowed, in this case, to account for the increase in volume by progressive stretching of the wall, and not by incorporation of a false aneurysmal sack resulting from an encapsulated haematoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the wall of this giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> showed various changes : on the inner aspect, progressive thickening occurs, due to fibrous organization of mural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; in the depth, far from the nutrient sources, necrotic atheromatous like foci occur, which isolate an inner leaflet, prone to become nectrotic at a later stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distension of such a weakened wall may lead to several consequences; a progressive increase in volume of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, partial ruptures with haemodissection starting from the aneurysmal lumen, or even complete rupture of the wall and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, circulatory stasis, due to the important increase in volume, may facilitate progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The living character of the wall is emphasized by the coexistance of these unfavourable (degeneration, ruptures) and favourable (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, fibrous organization) features, which continuously influence the spontaneous evolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
