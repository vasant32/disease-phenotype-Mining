<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period was 39 +/- 27 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Paroxysmal and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were seen in 37 and 31 subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assigned the subjects to three subgroups according to types of the events during the follow-up; recurrence group, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> group, and non-accident group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin time (international normalized ratio, INR) was assessed as mean value during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prothrombin time at the time of recurrence and hemorrhagic complication was also taken into consideration for data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> was observed in three patients (1.4%/yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 12 patients (5.5%/yr) and three of them were fatal (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean value of INR in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> group (3.0) was higher than that in the recurrence group (2.2) and in the non-accident group (2.3) (p &lt; 0.001, vs. non-accident group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lowest mean value of INR in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> group was 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prothrombin time in the recurrence group did not differ from that in the non-accident group </plain></SENT>
