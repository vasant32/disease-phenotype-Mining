<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The efficacy of thrombolytic therapy for treatment of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been a subject of both experimental and clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, in regard to reduction of volume of ischemic brain, of two different modes of administration (ie, intra-arterial and intravenous) of tissue-type plasminogen activator (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) given 30 minutes after experimental embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomized, blinded, controlled experimental trial was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was simulated in rabbits by injecting fragments of autologous arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> into one internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after embolization, the rabbits were blindly treated with 2 mg/kg intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, 2 mg/kg intravenous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, or saline (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six hours after embolization the rabbits were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brains were perfused with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> and cut into 0.5-cm-thick coronal sections, and the areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Administration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> resulted in a significant reduction in the volume of ischemic cerebral injury (P &lt; .0001): control animals sustained ischemic injury to 20.1 +/- 4.6% (mean +/- SD) of total brain compared with 4.6 +/- 4.1% for animals treated with intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and 3.4 +/- 2.6% for those treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference between intra-arterial and intravenous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> treatment was not significant (P = .786) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this rabbit model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, administration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> within 30 minutes resulted in a dramatic reduction in the amount of ischemic injury, with equal efficacy for the two modes of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results favor the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with intravenous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, given the rapidity with which intravenous therapy can be established in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
