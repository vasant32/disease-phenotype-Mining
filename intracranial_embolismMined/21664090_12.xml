<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We compared the safety of different devices by screening for subclinical intracranial embolic events after pulmonary vein isolation with either conventional irrigated radiofrequency (RF) or cryoballoon or multielectrode phased RF pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: New devices specifically designed to facilitate pulmonary vein isolation procedures have recently been introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective, observational, multicenter study included patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> referred for pulmonary vein isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ablation was performed using 1 of the 3 catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strict periprocedural anticoagulation, with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during ablation to achieve an activated clotting time &gt;300 s, was ensured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were included in the study: 27 in the irrigated RF group, 23 in the cryoballoon group, and 24 in the PVAC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total procedure times were 198 ± 50 min, 174 ± 35 min, and 124 ± 32 min, respectively (p &lt; 0.001 for PVAC vs. irrigated RF and cryoballoon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Findings on neurological examination were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before and after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post-procedure magnetic resonance imaging detected a single new embolic lesion in 2 of 27 patients in the irrigated RF group (7.4%) and in 1 of 23 in the cryoballoon group (4.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in the PVAC group 9 of 24 patients (37.5%) demonstrated 2.7 ± 1.3 new lesions each (p = 0.003 for the presence of new embolic events among the 3 groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PVAC is associated with a significantly higher incidence of subclinical intracranial embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further study of the causes and significance of these emboli is required to determine the safety of the PVAC </plain></SENT>
