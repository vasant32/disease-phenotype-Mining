<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary cerebral hemorrhagic complications may arise following suppression of coagulation during extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extensive valvular vegetation is regarded as an indicator for urgent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study aim was to determine the relative risk of thromboembolic complications, and to analyze the prognostic influence of different treatment strategies following <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of these complications, in particular, secondary cerebral hemorrhagic events after urgent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1978 and 1993, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 288 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients treated before 1982 (6.9%) were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients (93.1%) were followed prospectively (mean 4.3+/-1.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 50 patients (17.4%), the clinical course was complicated by one embolism, and in 58 patients (20.2%) by recurrent embolisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total, 71% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> embolisms were cerebral events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The operated patients were categorized with regard to the time between recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and cardiac surgery (&lt;72 h, 3-8 days, and &gt;8 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for patients operated within 72 h was significantly more favorable (p &lt;0.0001) than for those treated medically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing cardiac surgery more than eight days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and those treated conservatively, had poor prognoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> is complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, it is recommended that cardiac surgery be performed within 72 h of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, when the risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> appears to be low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cranial computed tomography is obligatory immediately before surgery in order to identify patients with early reperfusion <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> due to spontaneous fragmentation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In these patients, cardiac surgery must be postponed because of the high risk of severe cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during extensive perioperative anticoagulation, and is only justified in the case of an otherwise unfavorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
