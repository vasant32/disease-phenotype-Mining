<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The discharge diagnoses <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 432-436 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Danish neurological, neurosurgical and medical departments during the period 1980-1993 were identified in a central diagnosis register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of OC was achieved from complete sale statistics during the study period and cross-sectional studies assessing the type-specific use of OC at different ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the 14-year study period, 2,100 female and 2,552 male attacks were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men had an exponentially increasing IR with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with men in the period 1980-86, women had more attacks in the 20-35-year age group and fewer attacks above the age of 35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 1987 the sex differences below the age of 35 were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the first half (1980-86) to the last half (1987-1993) of the study period, women below 30 years had a significantly falling CTA IR of -20.4%, compared with a non-significant fall of -9.5% among men below 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the age group above 30 years, women experienced a not significant increase of 4.2%, men a significant increase of 11.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assuming that use of OC implied an average relative risk of CTA 111115 and pregnancy a relative risk of 4, a correction was made for the contribution of incident cases among women </plain></SENT>
