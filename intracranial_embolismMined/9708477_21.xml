<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) on left atrial (LA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) function in humans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atrial stunning and the development of spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (SEC) is a consequence of electrical cardioversion of AFL to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon has been termed "stunning" and is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation is now considered to be definitive treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AFL, but whether this procedure is complicated by LA stunning is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AFL undergoing curative RFA underwent transesophageal echocardiography to evaluate LA and LAA function and SEC before and immediately, 30 minutes and 3 weeks after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To control for possible direct effects of RFA on atrial function, seven patients undergoing RFA for paroxysmal AFL were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this group, RF energy was delivered in sinus rhythm and echocardiographic parameters were assessed before and immediately and 30 minutes following RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> AFL: Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> duration was 17.2 +/- 13.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (80%) developed SEC following RF energy application and reversion to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LAA velocities decreased significantly from 54.0 +/- 14.2 cm/s in AFL to 18.0 +/- 7.1 cm/s in sinus rhythm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> termination (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These changes persisted for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Following 3 weeks of sustained sinus rhythm, significant improvements in LAA velocities (68.9 +/- 23.6 vs. 18.0 +/- 7.1 cm/s, p &lt; 0.01) and mitral A-wave velocities (49.8 +/- 10.3 vs. 13.4 +/- 11.2 cm/s, p &lt; 0.01) were evident and SEC had resolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Paroxysmal AFL: Radiofrequency energy delivered in sinus rhythm had no significant effect on any of the above indexes of LA or LAA function and no patient developed SEC following RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AFL is associated with significant LA stunning and the development of SEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Left atrial stunning is not secondary to the RF energy application itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Sustained sinus rhythm for 3 weeks leads to resolution of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Left atrial stunning occurs in the absence of direct current shock or antiarrhythmic drugs, suggesting that its mechanism may be a function of the preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> rather than the mode of reversion </plain></SENT>
