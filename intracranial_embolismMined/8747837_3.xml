<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to measure the effects of cerebral arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> on cerebral blood flow and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rabbits were injected via the left internal carotid artery with the neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Left cerebral blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry, and left sided brain function by electrocorticogram and cortical somatosensory evoked responses following electrical stimulation of the forepaw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Readings were taken for 2 h before injection to establish a baseline, and for 3 h after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was significantly decreased at 45 min after the injection of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, then progressively decreased further to approximately 50% of baseline after 2 h, at which level it remained for the last hour of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The electrocorticogram was rapidly, but transiently, suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evoked responses did not differ from baseline at each of the time points measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using 125I-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi>, 2.49% of the injected dose was measured in the brain 3 min after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that in this rabbit model of cerebral arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> only a small percentage of injected <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> passes into the brain, but this is sufficient to cause a reduction in cerebral blood flow over the following 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The evoked responses never alter significantly from baseline values </plain></SENT>
