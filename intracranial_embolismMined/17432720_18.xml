<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Shock waves have been experimentally applied to various neurosurgical treatments including fragmentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> walls or tissue, and delivery of drugs into cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the application of shock waves to clinical neurosurgery remains challenging because the threshold for shock wave-induced brain injury has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the pressure-dependent effect of shock waves on histological changes of rat brain, focusing especially on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male rats were exposed to a single shot of shock waves (produced by silver <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40910">azide</z:chebi> explosion) at overpressures of 1 or 10 MPa after craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological changes were evaluated sequentially by H &amp; E staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of active caspase-3 and the effect of the nonselective caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK) were examined to evaluate the contribution of a caspase-dependent pathway to shock wave-induced brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-overpressure (&gt; 10 MPa) shock wave exposure resulted in contusional <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> associated with a significant increase in TUNEL-positive neurons exhibiting chromatin condensation, nuclear segmentation, and apoptotic bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximum increase was seen at 24 hours after shock wave application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low-overpressure (1 MPa) shock wave exposure resulted in spindle-shaped changes in neurons and elongation of nuclei without marked neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The administration of Z-VAD-FMK significantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells observed 24 hours after high-overpressure shock wave exposure (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the cytosolic expression of active caspase-3 was evident 24 hours after high-overpressure shock wave application; this increase was prevented by Z-VAD-FMK administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescence staining showed that TUNEL-positive cells were exclusively neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The threshold for shock wave-induced brain injury is speculated to be under 1 MPa, a level that is lower than the threshold for other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>High-overpressure shock wave exposure results in brain injury, including neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> mediated by a caspase-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is the first report in which the pressure-dependent effect of shock wave on the histological characteristics of brain tissue is demonstrated </plain></SENT>
