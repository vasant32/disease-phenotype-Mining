<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography was carried out with a 10-MHz probe placed directly on the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonic imaging demonstrated an atherosclerotic lesion in the lower half of the aorta in 76 patients (76%), a lesion in the upper half of the aorta in 89 patients (89%), and a lesion at the orifice of the innominate artery in 99 patients (99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prospective palpation identified an atherosclerotic lesion in 12 (25%) of 48 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thoracic computed tomography in 79 patients showed calcification in the lower half of the aorta in 6 patients (7.6%) and in the upper half of the aorta in 11 (13.9%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique allows the surgeon to modify cannulation, aortic clamping, and operative technique to reduce the risk of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to embolization of atherosclerotic debris from the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
