<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A two-by-two factorial design was employed to study the impact of complement <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> via pretreatment with cobra venom factor (CVF, 100 U/kg i.v.) in the setting of permanent (without tissue plasminogen activator; t-PA) and transient (with t-PA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two New Zealand white rabbits were assigned to one of four groups (n=8, each group): control without t-PA, control with t-PA, CVF without t-PA and CVF with t-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the complement intact animals, t-PA administration resulted in an approximate 30% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size when compared to the group not receiving t-PA (20.4+/-6.6% of hemisphere area vs. 30.1+/-7.2%; mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes in the complement depleted rabbits, with (30.7+/-8.2%) or without (30.2+/-7.9%) t-PA, were no different from the control group receiving no therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no difference in regional cerebral blood flow or final intracranial pressure values was noted between any of the four groups </plain></SENT>
