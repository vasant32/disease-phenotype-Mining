<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After embolism the EEG flattened, blood flow stopped in almost the entire injected hemisphere, cortical pH gradually fell from 7.31 +/- 0.09 to 7.05 +/- 0.10 and cortical K+ activity rose from 4.7 +/- 1.8 to 12.7 +/- 6.4 mmol/kg <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-five min after embolization, circulation had been resumed in almost the entire injected hemisphere, whereas metabolic changes were still disturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of the animals recovered complete neurological function and 20% showed permanent damage confirmed by histological examination after 1 week of recovery </plain></SENT>
