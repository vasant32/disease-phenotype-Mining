<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient reported here developed a generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> at age 12, which was followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018775" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bilateral hearing loss</z:e> and occasional <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern of hearing loss pointed to a possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> origin, which was confirmed by molecular analysis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA, revealing a heteroplasmic A3243G transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, muscle biopsy showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003200'>ragged-red fibers</z:hpo> in the proband, which is unusual in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo>-associated forms of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing impairment</z:hpo> in four generations of the family, fatal cerebral embolization in the mother and fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">heart attack</z:e> in the maternal grandmother (both at age 33) also occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which usually accompanies the hearing loss variant, was specifically absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The unusual manifestations associated with this mutation somewhat differentiate this family from the already known variants </plain></SENT>
