<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (CE) as evaluated by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) following transapical (TA) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) versus transfemoral (TF) TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The TA-TAVI approach avoids both the manipulation of large catheters in the aortic arch/ascending aorta and the retrograde crossing of the aortic valve, and this avoidance might lead to a lower rate of CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective multicenter study including 60 patients who underwent cerebral DW-MRI the day before and within the 6 days following TAVI (TF approach: 29 patients; TA approach: 31 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic and cognitive function assessments were performed at DW-MRI time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The TAVI procedure was performed with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> valve and was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases but one (98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 41 patients (68%) had 251 new cerebral ischemic lesions at the DW-MRI performed 4 Â± 1 days after the procedure, 19 patients in the TF group (66%) and 22 patients in the TA group (71%; p = 0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients (76%) with new ischemic lesions had multiple lesions (median number of lesions per patient: 3, range 1 to 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in lesion number and size between the TF and TA groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No baseline or procedural factors were found to be predictors of new ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of CE was not associated with a measurable impairment in cognitive function, but 2 patients (3.3%) had a clinically apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within the 24 h following the procedure (1 patient in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TAVI is associated with a high rate of silent cerebral ischemic lesions as evaluated by DW-MRI, with no differences between the TF and TA approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results provide important novel insight into the mechanisms of CE associated with TAVI and support the need for further research to both reduce the incidence of CE during these procedures and better determine their clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
