<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To demonstrate the diffusion-weighted (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and the follow-up MRI findings, of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The initial DWI and clinical findings of six patients with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The finding of DWI with a b-value of 1000 s/mm2 (b=1000) was compared with that of DWI with a b-value of 0 s/mm2 (b=0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In three patients who underwent follow-up MRI, the interval change of the lesion on T2-weighted images was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The characteristic DWI finding of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage was multiple, hyperintense, dot-like lesions disseminated in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These lesions were distributed dominantly in the bilateral border-zone areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some lesions had an ancillary location including the cortex, deep white matter, basal ganglia, and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lesions were more intense and numerous in DWI (b=1000) than in DWI (b=0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings on the follow-up T2-weighted images were multiple confluent hyperintense lesions in the white matter with progression since the initial MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DWI could be a sensitive tool for detecting cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is recommended that DWI be included in the initial evaluation of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> with MRI </plain></SENT>
