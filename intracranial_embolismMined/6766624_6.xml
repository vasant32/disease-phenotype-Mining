<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To avoid passage of emboli into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries, the delivery catheter may be wedged tightly into the artery or the artery completely occluded with a balloon catheter during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These techniques, termed occlusion control, were a valuable forward step and significantly enhanced patient safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, occluding the vessel completely may cause spasm, and allows the operator to introduce fluid and emboli under higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion pressures which can open extra- to intracranial shunts and cause disastrous intracranial embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A further refinement is suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First, the emboli are suspended in contrast agent; then the particles are introduced while arterial runoff of the contrast agent is watched so the acceptance rate of the artery is not exceeded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> perfusion pressures and flow then carry the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> distally into the abnormality being treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique is safe, easily learned, and gives the radiologist direct vision control over the embolization process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It has been used in39 patients with only one serious complication </plain></SENT>
