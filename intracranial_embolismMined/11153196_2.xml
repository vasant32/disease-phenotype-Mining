<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two cases of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with vascular anomalies were treated by intraarterial fibrinolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 78-year-old male had embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with fenestration of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> lodged in the terminal portion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and in the M2 portion of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fenestration was not detected before local fibrinolytic therapy, but was identified by postinterventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An 82-year-old female had a left-sided persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA), and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> lodged in the terminal portion of the left ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left internal carotid angiography also showed rich collateral circulation via the abundant leptomeningeal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PPTA involved the left ICA, so the anomalous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> had to be considered in performing local thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the rich collateral circulation allowed recanalization of the occluded ICA without inducing <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dissolution of persistently adherent emboli must be performed with great care because of the possibility of such rare vascular anomalies </plain></SENT>
