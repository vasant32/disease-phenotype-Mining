<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients were examined who were undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery with either a bubble oxygenator or a capillary membrane oxygenator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter incorporated an arterial filter and bubble trap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A noninvasive Doppler ultrasound technique is described for monitoring irregularities in the Doppler flow signals attributable to gaseous microemboli detected in the middle cerebral artery during CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ultrasound index for detecting gaseous microemboli (MEI) indicated the presence of such microemboli in 22 of the 27 patients during insertion of the aortic cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements during CPB showed the MEI ranged from 4 to 39 in the 17 patients with a bubble oxygenator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients with a membrane oxygenator had an MEI of 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Varying the gas flow rates in 3 patients with bubble oxygenators showed a change in MEI from 4 +/- 4 (SD) at a flow rate of 2 L/min to 17 +/- 9 at a flow rate of 5 L/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation supports the assumption that the MEI is providing quantitative information regarding the presence of gaseous emboli in the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
