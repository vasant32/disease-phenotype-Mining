<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Average dose to the whole brain was calculated using dosimetric data from the Radiation Doses in Interventional Radiology Study for 49 pediatric patients who underwent neuroradiological procedures, and lifetime risk of developing radiation-related <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> was estimated using published algorithms based on A-bomb survivor data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of absorbed dose within the brain can vary significantly depending on field size and movement during procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Depending on the exposure conditions and age of the patient, organ-averaged brain dose was estimated to vary from 6 to 1600 mGy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lifetime risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> diagnosis was estimated to be increased over the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> background rates (57 cases per 10,000) by 3 to 40% depending on the dose received, age at exposure, and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While significant uncertainties are associated with these estimates, we have quantified the range of possible dose and propagated the uncertainty to derive a credible range of estimated lifetime risk for each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collimation and limiting fluoroscopy time and dose rate are the most effective means to minimize dose and risk of future induction of radiation-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
