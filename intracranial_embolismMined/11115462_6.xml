<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVES: Blood flow in the aorta is complex and incompletely characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mobile aortic plaques (MAPs), moving freely with the pulsatile aortic flow, in fact represent natural tracers that reflect the flow pattern itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to use MAP motion on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in order to characterize flow patterns in the atheromatous thoracic aorta of patients with systemic emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND PATIENTS: The study group was recruited from 250 patients referred for TEE to evaluate recent embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, 22 patients (14 men and 8 women; mean +/- SD age, 66.3 +/- 7.2 years; 16 patients with cerebrovascular and 6 patients with peripheral emboli) with MAPs of &gt; or = 3 mm in length formed the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The longest amplitudes of three spatial components of mobile lesion motions were measured: x (antegrade/retrograde [A/R]), y (up/down [U/D], and z (right/left [R/L]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 33 mobile lesions were detected: 3 in the ascending aorta (1 patient), 13 in the arch (10 patients), and 17 in the descending aorta (11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The length of mobile plaque components ranged from 3 to 13 mm; amplitudes of A/R, U/d, R/L, and retrograde flow motions ranged from 3 to 26 mm, from 1 to 16 mm, from 1 to 17 mm, and from 1 to 13 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systolic rotational motion was clockwise in six patients (27%), counterclockwise in five patients (23%), incomplete (semicircle) in six patients (27%), and alternate clockwise/counterclockwise in five patients (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diastolic rotational motion was clockwise in 5 patients (23%), counterclockwise in 6 patients (27%), and incomplete (semicircle) in 11 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 18 multiple MAPs in seven patients: in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases, simultaneous rotations of MAP in different directions (as a marker for the presence of multiple vortices) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, MAPs on the distal part of aortic arch solely were found; in five of them, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> alternative potential sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, retrograde <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> from distal aortic plaques in these patients is highly probable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde and rotational blood flow in the thoracic aorta probably exists in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with systemic emboli and mobile protruding aortic atheromas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, retrograde <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> from distal aortic plaques is theoretically possible </plain></SENT>
