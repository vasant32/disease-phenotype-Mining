<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, novel insights into the pathophysiology of neurons, glial cells, and the fate of the endothelium after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> call for the use of new strategies to improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment alone or in combination with tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, despite the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of drugs that display clear beneficial effects in animal models of experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, their subsequent use in clinical trials has proven disappointing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As such, one is forced to consider that new animal models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may be required before clinical evaluation of a new molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In situ microinjection of purified murine thrombin was used to trigger a local clot formation in anesthetized mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood velocity was measured continuously throughout the duration of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator to induce thrombolysis and its subsequent effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were then measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In situ thrombin injection leads to a reproducible clot formation and cortical brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced thrombolysis reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 36.8% when compared with untreated control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We describe an original and reproducible mouse model of in situ clot formation and reperfusion, which could be used to investigate new therapeutic strategies to improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
