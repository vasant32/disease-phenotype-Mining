<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of echocardiography (TTE and TEE) to detect RLS compared to c-TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational study of patients &lt;55 years old with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> of undetermined origin (2007-2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent c-TCD monitoring to detect RLS, at rest and after Valsalva manoeuvre (VM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TTE and TEE were performed when indicated by our cerebrovascular protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of TTE and TEE for detecting RLS was calculated by comparing them with c-TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 115 patients with c-TCD, mean age 43.3 (SD 10.3) years, 51.3% male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TTE was performed in 102, and TEE in 81, patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RLS detection was higher with c-TCD than with TTE (67.6% vs. 22.5%, P=.001) or TEE (77.8% vs. 53.1%, P=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The TTE, compared with c-TCD after MV showed: sensitivity 31.8%, specificity 96.9%, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) 95.6%, negative predictive value (NPV) 40.5% and accuracy 52.9% to detect RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TEE, compared with c-TCD after MV showed: sensitivity 63.4%, specificity 83.3%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 93%, NPV 39.4% and accuracy 67.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of TTE and TEE improved when they were compared with c-TCD at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TTE and TEE show a considerable number of false negatives for RLS detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies should consider the c-TCD as the best technique to diagnose RLS when a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> is suspected </plain></SENT>
