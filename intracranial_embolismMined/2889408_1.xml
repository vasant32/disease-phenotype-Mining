<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was observed that levels of these enzymes in the CSF of control subjects were very low but were significantly elevated (p less than 0.001) in both serum and CSF in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The elevation was greater in the CSF than in the serum and was maximum during the first four days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the enzymatic activity declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these enzymes, GGTP in CSF correlated best with the clinical picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was possible to differentiate between the ischemic and hemorrhagic type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the basis of CSF levels of GGTP (greater than 60.0 units in hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between GGTP levels in CSF and serum or among GOT, GPT, and GGTP in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded, therefore, that estimation of GGTP in CSF is helpful not only in predicting the degree of cerebral damage and functional outcome of the patient following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but also in differentiating the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
