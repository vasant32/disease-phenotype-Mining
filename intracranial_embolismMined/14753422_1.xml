<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been shown in previous studies that recovery of apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) of water is not necessarily associated with a reversal of tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationships between temporal <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> change and histological outcome after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rat using an experimental MRI scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats underwent embolization of the right middle cerebral artery with autologous clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were measured consecutively for 3 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brains were prepared for histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transient decline of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was observed during the initial 2 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these areas, serial rCBF measurement revealed incomplete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some other areas, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease without rCBF recovery was observed during 3 hours postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed infarction in areas with persistent <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Scattered neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was noticeable in areas with a transient--in some areas less than 0.5 hour--<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Consecutive MRI analysis demonstrated postischemic transient <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease in an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model of rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The normalization of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> does not signify normalization of postischemic tissue, since the areas often evolve postischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at a later time </plain></SENT>
