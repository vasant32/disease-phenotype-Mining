<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one cases of iatrogenic arterial injury requiring repair at our institution from 1972 through 1984 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization accounted for most of the injuries (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten injuries (14%) resulted from angiography or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; four injuries (5.6%) occurred after invasive monitoring devices were inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six injuries (8.45%) stemmed from complications of intra-aortic balloon pump insertion, whereas the remainder occurred during various surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most injuries were in the femoral (42.3%) and brachial (38.1%) locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombectomy (23.9%) and resection with end-to-end anastomosis (35.2%) were the repairs most commonly performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morbidity and mortality were low; only one case resulted in limb loss, and neither of the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> resulted from the vascular repair itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our experience, we can make certain recommendations with regard to specific injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First, the conservative approach to brachial artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurring after catheterization is early exploration and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Second, although most injuries can be managed simply with thrombectomy and primary repair, iliofemoral injuries are more likely to require complex reconstructive techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Third, large-bore catheter injuries to the carotid artery require immediate exploration and repair to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, pseudoaneurysm, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fourth, symptoms of nerve compression after transaxillary arteriography require prompt exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that, depending on the site of injury, individualized techniques of varying complexity are required for repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In general, serious sequelae can be minimized by early recognition, prompt operation, and adherence to sound vascular surgical principles </plain></SENT>
