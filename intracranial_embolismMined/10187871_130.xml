<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality rates in the United States are well documented, assessment of incidence rates and case fatality are less well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 15 792 men and women aged 45 to 64 years from a population sample of households in 4 US communities was followed from 1987 to 1995, an average of 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were identified through annual phone contacts and hospital record searching and were then validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 267 incident definite or probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 83% (n=221) were categorized as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, 10% (n=27) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo>, and 7% (n=19) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted incidence rate (per 1000 person-years) of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was highest among black men (4.44), followed by black women (3.10), white men (1.78), and white women (1.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The black versus white age-adjusted rate ratio (RR) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was 2.41 (95% CI, 1.85 to 3.15), which was attenuated to 1.38 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.89) after adjustment for baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, education level, smoking status, and prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for the adjusted case fatality rates to be higher among blacks and men, although none of the case fatality comparisons across sex or race was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After accounting for established baseline risk factors, blacks still had a 38% greater risk of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> compared with whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Identification of new individual and community-level risk factors accounting for the elevated incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> requires further investigation and incorporation into intervention planning </plain></SENT>
