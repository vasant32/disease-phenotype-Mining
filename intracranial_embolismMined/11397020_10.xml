<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyse four years of CEA with respect to the underlying mechanisms of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the role of intraoperative monitoring in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1996 through December 1999, 599 CEAs were performed in 404 men and 195 women (mean age: 65 years, range: 39-88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were performed under general anaesthesia using computerised electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Any new or any extension of an existing focal cerebral deficit, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were classified by time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (intraoperative or postoperative), outcome (minor or major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), and side (ipsilateral or contralateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> aetiology was assessed intraoperatively by means of EEG, TCD, completion arteriography or immediate re-exploration, and postoperatively by duplex sonography, computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 20 (3.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four operations <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was apparent immediately after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were ipsilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (1) and embolisation (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> developed after a symptom-free interval (2-72 h, mean 18 h) due to occlusion of the internal carotid artery on the side of surgery (9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other mechanisms were: contralateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (1), postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome (1), intracerebral haemorrhage (1), and contralateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> due to prolonged clamping (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In three procedures the cause was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> from CEA developed after a symptom-free interval and mainly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> of the operated artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suggest the introduction of additional TCD monitoring during the immediate postoperative phase </plain></SENT>
