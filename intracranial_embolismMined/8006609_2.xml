<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The retrospective and prospective histologic examination of these cases revealed a total of 10% to have emboli of cerebral tissue within the pulmonary vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining of the emboli confirmed the neural origin of the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dura mater proved to be intact in 70% of the cases of cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We feel this provides evidence that embolization of cerebral tissue may occur without rupture of the dura and/or large venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This observation is of clinical as well as forensic importance, as cerebral tissue emboli are a rich source of thromboplastin in the systemic and pulmonary vasculature and may contribute to the morbidity and mortality of head injuries </plain></SENT>
