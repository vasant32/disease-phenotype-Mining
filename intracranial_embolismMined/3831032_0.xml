<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated preliminary results of valve replacement with a new Björk-Shiley valve prosthesis with integral monostrut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five valves were implanted in 56 patients (18 aortic, 30 mitral, 7 double, 1 triple) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age of the patients ranged from 30 to 62 years, and they were followed up for 7-17 months (mean, 12.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were three operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (5.3%) not related to the prosthesis and no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Minor cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> occurred in one patient 2 weeks after surgery despite <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative transvalvular pressure gradients across the 23-mm aortic and 27-mm mitral valve prostheses were insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Real-time two-dimensional echocardiography revealed no regurgitation at the moment of valve closure in 20 randomly selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Though the data accumulated so far are still relatively incomplete and the follow-up periods short, the clinical results obtained here were satisfactory, warranting further use of this new Björk-Shiley valve prosthesis with integral monostrut for longer follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
