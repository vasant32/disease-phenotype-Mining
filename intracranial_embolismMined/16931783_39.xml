<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> by its subtypes may contribute to more effective prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but few prospective studies have characterized risk factors for specific subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1987 and 1989, 14,448 men and women aged 45 to 64 years and free of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> took part in the first examination of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was ascertained from hospital surveillance records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 13.4-years, 531 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> occurred (105 lacunar, 326 nonlacunar, and 100 cardioembolic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blacks had a 3-fold higher multivariate-adjusted risk ratio of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No racial difference in nonlacunar or cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was found after adjusting for prevalent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to traditional risk factors, nontraditional risk factors, such as waist-to-hip ratio, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, were associated with increased risk for nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was related to only 1 nontraditional risk factor, white blood cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The population-attributable fraction (PAF) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was approximately 35% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The respective PAFs for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and current smoking were 26.3% and 22.0% for lacunar versus 11.3% and 11.4% for nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PAF for elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor was greater than that for current smoking for cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The impact of traditional and nontraditional risk factors other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> varied according to its subtype </plain></SENT>
