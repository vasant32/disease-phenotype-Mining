<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> Multicenter Italian (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>-MI) Study evaluated the prevalence and characteristics of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid arteries compared with control patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and the association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) in the subgroup of younger patients (aged less than 55 years) included in the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>-MI Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>-MI Study included 606 patients, enrolled between November 1990 and December 1996: 245 patients with a previous cerebral embolic attack and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid study and a control group of 316 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subgroup of younger patients aged less than 55 years included 90 patients (61 men and 29 women of mean age 49 +/- 5 years) (group AY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This group was evaluated and compared with an age- and sex-matched control population (61 men; of mean age 48 +/- 6 years) (group BY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was 48.8% (95% confidence interval 40-61) in group AY and 22.2% in the group BY (95% confidence interval 18-33) (chi(2) = 5.968; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphological features were similar in the 2 groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> involved the entire septum in 52% of patients of group AY, and in 47.2% of group BY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was 58.8% (95% confidence interval 43-62) in group AY and 28.8% in group BY (95% confidence interval 17-35) (chi(2) = 5.811; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A strong association was found between <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 90 younger patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 39 of 44 (88.6%) with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> also had <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, compared with 14 of 46 (30.4%) without <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (chi(2) = 7.370; p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> were independent predictive factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in younger patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid arteries and that the association between <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> bore an increased odds risk </plain></SENT>
