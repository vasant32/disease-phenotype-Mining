<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regional microembolization was induced by infusing Sephadex particles (diameter, 40 micron) into one of the common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first series of experiments, 2.5 mg Sephadex was infused, and the dogs were examined within 3-4 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a second series 0.55 mg Sephadex was infused, and the dogs were examined either in the first 3-4 hours or 24-48 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow, oxygen extraction ratio, and cerebral oxygen utilization were measured at 3 PCO2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> experiments, cerebral oxygen utilization in the embolized hemisphere was 6 (0.55 mg Sephadex) and 25% (2.5 mg Sephadex) lower than on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While cerebral blood flow was symmetrically distributed in normocapnia and <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp>, it was 9 (0.55 mg Sephadex) and 35% (2.5 mg Sephadex) lower in the embolized hemisphere during <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In normocapnia and <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> the lower oxygen utilization in the embolized hemisphere was characterized by a lower oxygen extraction ratio, and in <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> by an unchanged (0.55 mg Sephadex) or by a higher (2.5 mg Sephadex) extraction ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The different effect on oxygen extraction ratio in the control and embolized hemispheres resulted in images of uncoupling between perfusion and oxygen demand that varied according to the PCO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The experiments also showed a fall in cerebral blood flow in the embolized hemisphere after 3-4 hours, indicating delayed hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 24-48 hours, blood flow was about 10% higher in the embolized hemisphere, and this was observed at the 3 PCO2 levels, while the oxygen extraction ratio was systematically lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Oxygen utilization in the embolized hemisphere was depressed to practically the same extent as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that between 4 and 24 hours after microembolization the cerebral microcirculation shows important changes, with installation of luxury perfusion in the face of an unchanging decreased oxygen metabolism </plain></SENT>
