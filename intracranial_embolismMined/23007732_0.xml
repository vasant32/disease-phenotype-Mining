<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical resection remains the optimal therapy for cirrhotic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>) that are not suitable for liver transplantation (LT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, various innovative techniques for liver resection have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of the study was to compare radiofrequency-assisted parenchyma transection (RF-PT) with the traditional clamp-crushing (CC) technique to explore the preferred therapy in cirrhotic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2010, 75 cirrhotic patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> who underwent hepatectomy were randomized to RF-PT (group 1, n = 38) or CC-PT (group 2, n = 37) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was intraoperative blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoints included hepatic transection time, total operating time, postoperative morbidity, mortality, length of intensive care unit and hospital stays, and liver function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The characteristics of the two patient groups were closely matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Pringle maneuver was not used in RF-PT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The blood loss of the RF-PT group, total or during transection, was significantly lower than that of the CC-PT group (385 vs. 545 ml, p = 0.001; 105 vs. 260 ml, p = 0.000, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with CC-PT patients, the morbidity of the RF-PT group was lower though not statistically significant (28.9 vs. 38.8 %, p = 0.197) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in the RF-PT group 12 days postoperative due to a large area <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RF-PT is a safe and feasible surgical resection method for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, RF-PT results in lower blood loss and lower morbidity than the CC technique during liver resection </plain></SENT>
