<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe changes in demographic, clinical and micro-biological characteristics of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE), and to assess factors associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Episodes fulfilling the Duke criteria for definite IE were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data collected in 1980-1991, and 1992-2003 from IVDU and non-IVDU patients' records were collected, and changes within each group and between the groups analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 169 episodes of IE in IVDUs, and 114 in non-IVDUs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HIV-infected patients were 86 (82 IVDUs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Site of involvement, need for surgery, and case fatality rate (15.6% among IVDUs and 11.3% non-IVDUs) did not change in both groups over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staphylococci and streptococci were the most commonly isolated organisms among IVDUs and non-IVDU, respectively; independent predictors of mortality among IVDUs were negative blood cultures [adjusted OR (AOR) 7.85], and fungal etiology (AOR 21.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among non-IVDUs prosthetic heart valves had an AOR of 2.22 (95% CI 0.48-10.21); the proportion of negative blood cultures significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An higher case-fatality rate was observed among HIV-positive patients (AOR 2.64 95% CI 0.85-8.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Late diagnosis and lack of etiological definition continue to represent the most important obstacles to an effective management of IE, suggesting the need for a wider use of molecular techniques in patients with suspected IE </plain></SENT>
