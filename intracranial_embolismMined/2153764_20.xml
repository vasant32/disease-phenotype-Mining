<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the charts of 58 long-term survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149925" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="SCLC">small-cell lung cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCLC</z:e>) (greater than 2 years) for neurological complications and their impact on the well-being of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also attempted to have patients complete a questionnaire regarding any possible neurological problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was done in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">Metastasis</z:e> to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> occurred significantly less often in patients who received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in a dose of 20 Gy in five equal fractions (two of 48), compared with patients who did not receive it (four of 10) (P less than .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delayed neurological complications occurred in nine of 48 (19%) patients who received PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in only two patients did PCI appear to be responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>progressive dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other seven patients (one with <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in the arms and legs, one with transient left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, two with hearing loss, and three with various visual disturbances), chemotherapeutic agents (mainly <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>) and underlying diseases probably contributed significantly to the occurrence of these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, these neurological disturbances were transient or ran a stable course and did not adversely affect the daily life of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison, amongst the 10 patients who did not receive PCI one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>progressive dementia</z:hpo> and another had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> secondary to probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the use of PCI in these doses was effective in reducing the frequency of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and had an adverse effect on the daily life and well-being only in a minority of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Until results of controlled randomized studies show otherwise, PCI should continue to be used as a part of the combined modality treatment of completely responding patients with limited <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCLC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
