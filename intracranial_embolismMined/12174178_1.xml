<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) and hemodynamic features in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic intracranial cerebral artery stenoses by transcranial Doppler (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheric ischemic events and corresponding intracranial cerebral artery stenoses as identified by TCD, and exclusion of extracranial or cardiac emboli sources were repeatedly studied by TCD monitoring of the affected and the contralateral vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> clusters (&gt; or =3 MES per second) and of flow velocity changes was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients presented with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the affected artery during the first measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In seven patients sudden flow velocity changes could be detected in the affected vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In five patients these changes were accompanied by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and velocity changes disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during follow-up, and the degree of stenosis decreased in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and sudden velocity changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial cerebral artery stenoses indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial stenoses may be formed at least in part by mobile thrombotic material </plain></SENT>
