<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>Varicose veins</z:hpo> are common and increasingly are being treated by less invasive endoscopic methods such as foam sclerotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>Patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) is also common, present in approximately one-quarter of adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> allows bubbles introduced by foam sclerotherapy to cross into the general circulation, potentially causing cerebral artery gas embolization with unevaluated consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Men and women aged 18 to 60 years with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> (CEAP C(3-5)) responded to an advertisement to recruit volunteers for a study on endovenous microfoam ablation (EMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants' veins were screened by duplex ultrasound imaging, and those with isolated great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence were tested for right-to-left (R-L) vascular shunt using transcranial Doppler (TCD) of the middle cerebral artery to detect the presence of bubble emboli after an injection of an agitated saline, blood, and air mixture as a contrast at rest and with the Valsalva maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 221 participants tested for R-L shunt, 85 (38.5%) were positive at rest (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.5-45.2) and 114 (51.8%) were positive after the Valsalva maneuver (95% CI, 45.4-58.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total 130 patients (58.8%) were positive for R-L shunt at rest or after Valsalva (95% CI, 52.5%-65.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is significantly higher than the reported 26% prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in the general population (95% CI, 24.4-30.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of R-L shunt in patients with GSV incompetence CEAP C(3-5) in this study was higher than expected in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD does not differentiate between intracardiac shunts and intrapulmonary shunts, so this observation needs further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This link between R-L shunt and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> is novel and, whether etiologic or functional, may improve the understanding of both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings have importance in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> with foam sclerotherapy and EMA </plain></SENT>
