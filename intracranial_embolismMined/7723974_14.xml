<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been few cases studied in which damage was restricted to portions of the body of the callosum, and most of those involved surgical callosotomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a woman with a transient alien hand syndrome caused by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> limited to the middle and posterior portions of the body of the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case provides supportive evidence for damage to the midbody of the corpus callosum as the anatomic basis of nondominant alien hand syndrome and conforms to a model of interhemispheric motor disconnection as the essential component of this unusual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349251" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioral syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This disconnection can occur with injuries involving interhemispheric premotor and motor fibers traveling in the midportion of the callosum in individuals with left hemisphere dominance for motor activities </plain></SENT>
