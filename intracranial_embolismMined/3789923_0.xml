<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to establish qualitative and quantitative baseline criteria in an animal model for future studies evaluating the effectiveness of thrombolytic and cholesterol emulsifying agents which could eliminate or reduce experimentally induced occlusive atheroembolic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen male NZW rabbit received sublethal intracarotid injections of human atheroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours the animals were sacrificed, having their brains fixed by cardiac perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each left hemisphere was coronally sliced anteroposteriorly at 3 mm intervals, and paraffin or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25218">methacrylate</z:chebi> sections were taken from each slice and stained with H &amp; E or Toluidine Blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples from infarcted tissue were processed for TEM observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each section was projected onto the digitizing tablet of a Microplan II image analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The perimeter length, area and maximum diameter were measured for each <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regional distribution of each <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> per section level was recorded on stereotaxic atlas diagrams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The vascular lesions were characteristic of cerebral atheroembolic occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were distributed primarily in the cortical and subcortical regions, and were largest in the distribution territory of the Middle Cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The morphometric parameters of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were highly variable at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> slice levels </plain></SENT>
