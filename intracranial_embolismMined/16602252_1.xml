<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypoxemia could occur during hyperbaric air breathing in patients with lung dysfunction, although this has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of hypoxemia during air breathing with two patients treated with the US Navy Table 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 was an 11-year-old male with cerebral gas embolism (during cardiac transplantation), patient 2 was a 66-year-old female with cerebral gas embolism from a central venous catheter accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both were mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We monitored arterial blood gas (ABG) during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both patients, ABG measurements showed <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> during the first air breathing period at 1.9 atm abs (192.5 kPa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If patients require &gt; or = 40% inspired oxygen before HBO2 therapy, oxygenation monitoring is advisable during air breathing periods, especially at lower chamber pressures (&lt; or = 2.0 atm abs) </plain></SENT>
