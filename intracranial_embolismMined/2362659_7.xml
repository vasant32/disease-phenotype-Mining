<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have had the opportunity to study two patients with GSAs, which has allowed for a complete comparative anatomical and radiological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report emphasizes the etiology of the GSAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients with GSAs have been reported in the literature, of which pathological studies were done in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most of these, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was found to be filled with an organized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, but in our patients the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was filled with relatively new clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> enlarged and a change in the tortuous vascular channel was observed over a period of 1 year in the first patient, whereas a globoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> developed into a GSA in the brief period of just 2 weeks in the second patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This rapid transformation of a globoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> into a GSA is of particular interest when the etiology of GSAs is considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our patients therefore shed some interesting light on the possible pathophysiology of GSAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>That is, the bloodstream may change dynamically in a giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and may become a <z:chebi fb="107" ids="46670,9119">serpentine</z:chebi> channel under conditions that lead to a "Coanda effect." </plain></SENT>
