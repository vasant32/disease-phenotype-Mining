<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insertion using the designated technique was successful in 45 (88%) of 51 patients with percutaneous insertion and 48 (96%) of 50 patients with surgical insertion (difference not statistically significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time from the beginning of the insertion procedure to the initiation of counterpulsation was 13 +/- 8 minutes for the percutaneous technique versus 31 +/- 16 minutes for the surgical technique (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the percutaneous group, 10 patients required Fogarty thrombectomy after balloon pump removal, and 1 patient developed severe leg <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> requiring immediate termination of balloon pump support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the surgical group, one patient developed leg <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> requiring surgical intervention, three patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> (including one patient who required vein patch repair of the femoral artery), one patient developed a wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> requiring debridement and one patient had a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo>, aortoiliac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> did not occur in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major vascular complications occurred in 11 patients (22%) with percutaneous insertion versus 2 patients (4%) with surgical insertion (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that although the percutaneous technique for intraaortic balloon pump insertion is faster than the surgical technique and is technically easy, it is associated with a higher incidence of vascular complications </plain></SENT>
