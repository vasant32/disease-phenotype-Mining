<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective study performed in the two medical ICUs of a teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: The charts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 228 consecutive patients aged 18 years or older admitted with infective IE between January 1993 and December 2000 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients satisfied the modified Duke's criteria for definite IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: There were 146 episodes of native valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and 82 of prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant causative micro-organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most complications occurred early during the course of IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One-half of the patients underwent cardiac surgery during the same hospitalization and had a better outcome than nonoperated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 45% (102/228) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed the following clinical factors in patients with native valve IE as independently associated with outcome: septic shock (odds ratio 4.81), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> (3.00), immunocompromised state (2.88), and cardiac surgery (0.475); in patients with prosthetic valve IE the factors were: septic shock (4.07), neurological complications (3.1), and immunocompromised state (3.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IE still carries high morbidity and mortality rates for the subset of patients requiring ICU admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most complications occur early making the decision process for optimal medical and surgical management more difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment appears to improve in-hospital outcome </plain></SENT>
