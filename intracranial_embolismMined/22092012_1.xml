<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with new foci of restricted diffusion on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of cerebral microembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present investigation was to quantify the cerebral embolic load and to evaluate during which phase of the TAVI procedure microembolism occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the association between the cerebral embolic load and post-procedural release of S100B, a serological marker of cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 21 patients, we described the extent and intra-procedural distribution of microemboli during the TAVI procedure using the transcranial Doppler technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>S100B, a marker of astroglial injury, was measured for 24 h after the procedure, and the area under the curve (AUC(24h) ) relating S100B to time was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the TAVI procedure, a mean of 282 Â± 169 emboli was detected, 37% occurred during manipulation of the aortic arch/root/valve by guide wires and catheters, 22% occurred immediately after balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the native valve and 41% occurred during frame expansion of the valve prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>S100B increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a peak at 1 h after the procedure and returned to baseline after 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between the total amount of cerebral microemboli and the AUC(24h) for S100B (r = 0.68, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TAVI is associated with a substantial amount of cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The microembolic load correlates to the degree of post-procedural release of a marker of cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
