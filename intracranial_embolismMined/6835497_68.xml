<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with giant (greater than 25 mm in diameter) and 9 patients with large (15 to 25 mm in diameter) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the internal carotid artery in the ophthalmic or paraophthalmic region are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 23 of these patients the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was clipped directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this group, and none of the survivors had disabling neurological complications outside the visual system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other 11 patients were treated by a trapping procedure or by either common carotid ligation or internal carotid ligation in the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 5 patients treated by internal carotid ligation preceded by an extracranial to intracranial bypass graft, 3 developed embolic complications, which in 1 patient resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the 4 patients treated by ligation of the common carotid artery died 1 year later from a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the total group, 18 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> preoperatively as a result of aneurysmal compression; in 10 the vision was improved by operation, in 3 it was made worse, and in 2 it was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In another patient the vision continued to deteriorate slowly after common carotid occlusion, and the other 2 patients died postoperatively before vision could be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The complications in the patients are described and analyzed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maneuvers found to be of value in the direct approach to these lesions are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, exposure of the internal carotid artery in the neck for temporary occlusion during clipping and thorough drilling of the anterior clinoid process and unroofing of the optic canal were particularly helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The literature on indirect methods of treatment by carotid occlusion with and without bypass graft is reviewed with special reference to the complications and effectiveness of each alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on this review of the literature and our experience, a treatment scheme is suggested for these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> depending on their mode of presentation </plain></SENT>
