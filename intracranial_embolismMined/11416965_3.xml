<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on complications and outcome are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and echocardiographic findings of 17 patients with mechanical PVT were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complications and outcome of surgery and/or thrombolysis were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prospective follow-up was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptomatic PVT occurred 8.4 +/- 7.2 years after mechanical valve replacement at mean age 55 +/- 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> involved the mitral valve in 12 patients (71%), the aortic valve in 4 (24%) and the tricuspid valve in one (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reason for PVT was inadequate anticoagulation in 11 patients (65%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006685'>endomyocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> in 2 (12%) and unknown in 4 (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior to diagnosis, systemic emboli occurred in 6 patients (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (76%) presented in functional class NYHA IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic valve obstruction was documented by echocardiography in 15 patients (88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment included primary reoperation in 12 patients (71%), thrombolysis with urokinase in 3 (18%) (with reoperation in 1), reinstitution of adequate anticoagulation in one (6%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred before treatment in one (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively, both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155094,C0333350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">pannus</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> were found in 5 of 13 patients (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related emboli occurred in 5 patients (29%), to the brain in 3, to the legs in one and to a coronary artery in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five patients died (mortality 29%) within 30 days due to multiorgan failure/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">septicaemia</z:e> (3 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (1), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Follow-up after 28 +/- 28 months in the 12 surviving patients was unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most common aetiology for obstructive PVT is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation due to inadequate anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>PVT remains a serious complication with high morbidity and mortality despite aggressive treatment by thrombolysis and/or surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Surgery is often needed due to the frequent presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155094,C0333350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">pannus</z:e> and/or large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, long-term prognosis after successful treatment of PVT is excellent </plain></SENT>
