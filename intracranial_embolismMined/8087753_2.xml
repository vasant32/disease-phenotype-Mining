<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Two hundred consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo> who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation between September 1990 and June 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Electrophysiologic study and radiofrequency catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Success rate, duration of fluoroscopy, complications and long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 224 accessory pathways in the 200 patients 135 were left free wall, 47 posteroseptal, 32 right free wall and 10 anteroseptal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall success rate increased from 53% in the first 3 months of the study period to 96% in the last 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The success rate depended on the location of the accessory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of fluoroscopic exposure decreased from 50 (standard deviation [SD] 21) minutes in the first 3 months to 40 (SD 15) minutes in the last 3 months (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 3.5% of the patients; they included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011851'>hemopericardium</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the right atrial wall, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> in a coronary artery and <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> at the arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the complications resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With experience, radiofrequency catheter ablation of accessory pathways can have an overall success rate of more than 95% and a complication rate of less than 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Such rates make this procedure suitable for first-line therapy for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
