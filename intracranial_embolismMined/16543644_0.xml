<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mathematical model for flow in the arcadal network was developed, based on in vivo data of cat cerebral microvasculature and flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The network model consisted of 45 vessel segments, and 25 branching points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To simulate microvascular responses to blood flow, the following three types of responses to wall shear stress were considered; non-reactive (solid-like), cerebral arteriole, and skeletal muscle arteriole-like responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numerical calculation was carried out in the condition where a feeding arteriole was occlused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow changes in efferent vessels were evaluated for assessment of blood supply to the local area of cerebral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present simulation has demonstrated that blood flow in efferent vessels was influenced by the topology of the vascular network and the response pattern in single vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The arcadal structure of arterioles might be most effective in response to flow disturbances in efferent vessels </plain></SENT>
