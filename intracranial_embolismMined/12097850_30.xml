<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In view of the poor prognosis for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial vertebrobasilar occlusion (VBO), factors were sought that predict survival and good neurologic outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> endovascular treatment by means of local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LIF was performed in 83 patients with angiographically established <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> VBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant residual stenosis after LIF was treated by additional <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The types of occlusion were classified as either embolic occlusion (EO) or atherothrombotic occlusion (AO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was evaluated after 3 months by the Barthel Index (BI) as favorable (BI &gt;90), unfavorable (BI &lt;90) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and compared for each of 3 diagnostic or treatment variables: recanalization success, occlusion type and time to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four fibrinolytic treatment modes [urokinase, low-dose and high-dose recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), rt-PA + Lys-plasminogen] were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome was favorable in 19 patients (23%), unfavorable in 14 (17%) and 50 died (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was successful in 54 patients (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neurologic outcome was better in recanalized than in nonrecanalized patients (favorable outcome: 30 vs. 10%, mortality: 54 vs. 72%; p = 0.118) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neurologic outcome was better in EO than in AO (favorable outcome: 31 vs. 17%, mortality: 47 vs. 70%, p = 0.112) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Under combined treatment by LIF and <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> in 8 patients with AO, 4 survived, 3 with a favorable outcome (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (&lt;or=6 h) led to a significantly better neurologic outcome than delayed treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (&gt;6 h; favorable outcome: 36 vs. 7%, mortality: 52 vs. 70%, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although no statistically significant differences were found between the types of fibrinolytic agents, treatment with rt-PA and Lys-plasminogen tended toward better results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> proved to be the most important factor for successful endovascular therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> VBO, whereas recanalization and presence of an embolic occlusion also tended toward better results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additional <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> may be a promising therapy in cases of significant residual stenosis after LIF </plain></SENT>
