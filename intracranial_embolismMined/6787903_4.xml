<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of embolization(0.9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients ond 0.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> angiographic examinations) was about the same as has been reported in adults, but the clinical consequences were much milder, only one patient having documented transient neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also the angiographic appearance of the emboli differed from those described in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These differences may in part be due to the technique (general anesthesia with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>) but also to different reactions towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and to different types of emboli in children </plain></SENT>
