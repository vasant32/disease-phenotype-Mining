<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-three rats were embolized in the right middle cerebral artery and assigned to: (1) controls; (2) combination (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> amph and later amph-facilitated retraining); (3) late amph (later amph-facilitated retraining alone); and (4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> amph (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> amph alone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals in the combination and in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> amph groups received a high dose of amph immediately after embolization, while later amph-facilitated retraining in the combination and late amph groups was done by administering a low dose of amph on post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> days 2, 5, 8, and 11 followed by retraining in Montoya's Staircase Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats receiving <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> amph immediately after embolization achieved an 11% increase in median blood pressure (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An investigation of performances with the ipsilateral paws during days 14-21 showed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> amph group performed better than the control group (P&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were lower among animals in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> amph group than in both the combination and the late amph groups (P&lt;0.05), while the controls did not differ from any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In conclusion, results showed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> amph group performed the best, while the late amph and the combination groups performed the worst </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">Amphetamine</z:chebi> treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be warranted due to reduced detrimental effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and improved brain plasticity </plain></SENT>
