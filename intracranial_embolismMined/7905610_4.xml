<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 113 rats the carotid territory was embolized with a fibrin-rich clot formed in <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by intra-arterial 133Xenon injection method before and after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hours after embolization 67 animals were treated with tissue plasminogen activator 20 mg kg-1, 46 control animals with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NBQX was given to 53 animals, of which 41 animals also received thrombolytic therapy and 12 were saline controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid angiography displayed the rate of occlusion of the cerebral arterial supply before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brains were fixed after two days, evaluated neuropathologically, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Embolization caused a 60-78% reduction of median CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The comparison of post-treatment angiography of thrombolytic treated animals to controls showed significant (p &lt; 0.01) reperfusion in thrombolytic treated animals, while NBQX alone did not enhance reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic therapy significantly reduced the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 19.5% to 4.5% of embolized hemisphere volume (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NBQX alone reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 19.5% to 6.5% and cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 7.9% to 0.3% (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In thrombolytic treated animals NBQX reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 4.5% to 2.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The more than 50% reduction of total infarction volume caused by NBQX was not statistically significant due to the variation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Small haemorrhagic lesions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were observed in thrombolytic treated animals </plain></SENT>
