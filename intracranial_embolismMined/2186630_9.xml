<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ancrod cleaves fibrinogen; the resulting circulating ancrod-fibrin stimulates fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ancrod action and effect were studied in 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, and received either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline or ancrod 0.5 mu/kg in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline administered as a constant-rate intravenous infusion over 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent doses of ancrod (or saline placebo) were determined daily thereafter for a total treatment period of 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> nor re-<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred within the 90 day follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>That ancrod acted rapidly was shown by a significant decrease in functional plasminogen activator inhibitor (PA-I) within 60 minutes, and by significant elevations of fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer within 3 and 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The biological effect of fibrinolysis in ancrod infused patients was demonstrated by a greater improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> score when compared to those infused with saline </plain></SENT>
