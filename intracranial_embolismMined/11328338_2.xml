<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of large cerebral arteries is the most frequently presumed pathomechanism, various <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns have been described in patients with PRV and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> and known PRV, in whom a scattered lesion pattern was detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), but was not visible on computed tomography (CT) and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further diagnostic work-up including extra- and transcranial Doppler sonography (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>, TCD), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), magnetic resonance angiography and Holter monitoring revealed no obvious sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in both cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adding DWI to the diagnostic work-up may help to clarify etiology in patients with PRV and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
