<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six animals died after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining animals were killed after various time intervals and the occluded arteries studied by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The general pattern of the embolic event in the cerebral arteries was that there were 3 groups of changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Firstly, an immediate period of atherothrombotic occlusion occurred, which was followed by some resolution of the obstruction so as to leave the cholesterol crystals of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> stuck in the vessel walls as the only remaining element of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, there was a late period in which the cholesterol crystals were isolated from the lumen of the vessel and surrounded by macrophages, fibroblastic cells and collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endothelial lined channels developed in the original obstruction </plain></SENT>
