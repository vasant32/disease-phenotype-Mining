<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continued blockages may result in numerous shunt revisions until the blood has been cleared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have treated 3 children with shunt malfunctions secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> with urokinase, a thrombolytic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two children had <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> following a shunt revision and were treated with intrashunt urokinase, and 1 with occlusion of an atrial catheter was treated with both intrashunt and systemic urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were symptomatic at the time of treatment (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, full fontanel, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> demonstrated on computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various dosage regimens were used with total intrashunt doses of 20,000, 50,000, and 70,000 IU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> improved clinically, computed tomography scans demonstrated improvement, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were discharged from the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no complications of the urokinase administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2 children with proximal occlusion have not required further shunt revisions at 12 and 27 months following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The infant with atrial end occlusion subsequently underwent two proximal revisions with eventual removal of the atrial catheter because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude the intrashunt urokinase can be of value in the treatment of shunts by blood and blood products </plain></SENT>
