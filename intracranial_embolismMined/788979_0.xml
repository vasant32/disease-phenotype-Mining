<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function studies revealed an alarming degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, and satisfactory blood pressure control could not be maintained despite increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
