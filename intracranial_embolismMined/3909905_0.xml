<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were evaluated in relation to the emboligenic potential of the lesions observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5 positive results were obtained (4.46%) on echocardiography (3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the interatrial septum, 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>) and 10 positive results (10.99%) were demonstrated on the Holter monitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 45 (40.18%) echocardiographic anomalies capable of constituting a cardiac site of origin of emboli, there were 18 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the left chambers of the heart, 13 cases of calcification of the aortic valve, 8 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the mitral valve and 8 cases of calcification of the mitral ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, 55.35 per cent of the echocardiographic examinations and 52.74 per cent of the Holter examinations were found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the yield of these examinations is low, the anomalies discovered were definitely responsible for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and could only have been demonstrated by such investigations </plain></SENT>
