<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: TAVI is a novel therapeutic approach for multimorbid patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated peri-interventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and its relationship to clinical and serologic parameters of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral DW-MRI was performed before, directly, and 3 months after TAVI with the current third-generation self-expanding CoreValve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the timepoints of the serial MRI studies, focal neurological impairment was assessed according to the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS), and serum concentration of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a marker of the volume of brain tissue involved in an ischemic event, were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled; 22 completed the imaging protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients (10%) had new neurological findings after TAVI, of whom only 1 (3.6%) had a permanent neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 22 TAVI patients with complete imaging data, 16 (72.7%) had 75 new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> after TAVI presumed to be embolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The NIHSS and NSE were not correlated with DW-MRI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of clinically silent peri-interventional cerebral embolic lesions after TAVI is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in this cohort of 30 patients, the incidence of persistent neurological impairment was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(Incidence and Severity of Silent and Apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral Embolism</z:e> After Conventional and Minimal-invasive Transfemoral Aortic Valve Replacement; NCT00883285) </plain></SENT>
