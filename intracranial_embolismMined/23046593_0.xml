<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence of silent cerebral embolization when using the transradial approach for diagnostic coronary angiography (DCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Compared to other vascular access sites, the right transradial approach (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTA</z:e>) could reduce the amount of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain emboli</z:e> by avoiding mechanical trauma to the aortic wall caused by catheters and wire, whereas it increases manipulation of catheters in the ascending aorta and has a higher risk of direct embolization into the right common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recent study showed an increased incidence of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTA</z:e> compared to femoral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, left transradial approach (LTA) has never been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 40 patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> were randomized to DCA via <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTA</z:e> (n=20) or LTA (n=20) with contemporaneous bilateral transcranial Doppler monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with a significantly higher rate in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTA</z:e> group (median 61, interquartile range (IQR) 47-105, vs 48, IQR 31-60, p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> generated during procedures needing &gt;2 catheters (n=8), are higher than those detected during procedures performed with 2 catheters (n=32, 102, IQR 70-108, vs 48, IQR 33-60, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At multivariate analysis increasing number of catheters was the only independent predictor of high incidence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (OR 16.4, 95% CI 1.23-219.9, p=0.034, -2LL=26.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LTA has a lower risk of brain embolization because of the lower number of catheter exchange maneuvers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> depends on the magnitude of mechanical manipulation, catheter changes should be minimized to reduce the risk of cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
