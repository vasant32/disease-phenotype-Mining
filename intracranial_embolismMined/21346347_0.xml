<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously reported that intracranial large-artery atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (ICAS) had a relatively large salvageable area of less severe hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, information regarding the outcome after ICAS is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized ICAS would show more favorable clinical and radiological outcomes than other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients underwent admission (n = 149) and follow-up (n = 80) multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> within 6 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T(max) perfusion lesion maps were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed the difference in the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth ([follow-up diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) volume--initial DWI volume]/initial penumbra volume) and the presence of excellent long-term outcome [defined as a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score ≤ 2 and a modified Barthel index (mBI) ≥ 90 at 3 months] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 149 patients, 24 (16.1%) had ICAS, 75 (50.3%) had cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 21 (14.1%) had extracranial large-artery atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 29 (19.5%) had cryptogenic embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite a higher recurrence rate in patients with ICAS compared to other subtypes (p = 0.026), the long-term outcome was better in ICAS (p = 0.003 for an mRS score ≤ 2 and p = 0.004 for an mBI ≥ 90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 80 patients who underwent follow-up MRI, patients who had minimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth (less than 10%) were more prevalent among the patients with ICAS (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate testing revealed that ICAS was independently associated with both excellent long-term outcome (OR = 3.45; 95% CI = 1.11-10.78) and minimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth (OR = 10.40; 95% CI = 1.20-90.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that patients with ICAS have favorable clinical and radiological outcomes compared with other subtypes </plain></SENT>
