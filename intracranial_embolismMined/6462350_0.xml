<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 50-year-old woman noticed right motor and sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> in the morning of December 15, 1978, which improved gradually to be able to walk during 20 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had recurrence of incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> of right extremities with speech disturbance and admitted to our department on April 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plain skull rentogenorgram showed a calcification extending posteriorly from the left anterior clinoid process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed a mass lesion located at the left frontal lobe to the ambient cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mass lesion showed high density, but its midportion was isodensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The left carotid angiogram demonstrated abnormally curved, tortuous and dilated internal carotid artery at the intracavernous portion (C3) to bifurcation (C1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cerebral circulation time was greatly delayed, which regained about 6 seconds for the visualization of the distal portion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the above, we considered that the first right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> was due to emboli produced in the dolichoectasia and the following progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was attributable to the low perfusion demonstrated by a great delay of circulation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The operation was performed to trap the dolichoectasia after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, trapping procedure was very difficult because of hardness of the distal portion of the involved artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, surgery was concluded with STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and only proximal internal carotid clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The postoperative angiography demonstrated well functional anastomosis and obliteration of dolichoectasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>She discharged on improvement of her condition on the 23rd day after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CT scan performed 6 months after operations showed the mass lesion to have become definitely reduced in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The application of bypass surgery to the internal carotid dolichoectasia was reported with review of the literatures </plain></SENT>
