<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of filter design on blood flow impairment in the internal carotid artery (ICA) among patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS) using filter-type emboli protection devices (EPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July 2003 and March 2007, 115 filter-protected CAS procedures were performed at an academic institution in 107 consecutive patients (78 men; mean age 68 years, range 38-87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Angioguard, FilterWire EZ, and Spider filters were used in 68 (59%), 32 (28%), and 15 (13%) of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, procedural and angiographic data, and outcomes were prospectively entered into an electronic database and reviewed retrospectively along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Flow impairment while the filter was in place was observed in 25 (22%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presumptive reason of flow impairment was filter obstruction in 21 (18%) instances and flow-limiting spasm at the level of the filter in 4 (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, flow was restored after retrieval of the filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow obstruction in the ICA occurred more frequently with Angioguard (22/68; 32.3%) than with FilterWire EZ (2/32; 6.2%) or Spider (1/15; 6.7%; p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No flow occurred in 13 (19%) procedures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them protected with Angioguard; no patient treated with other devices experienced this event (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two (8.0%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in procedures associated with flow impairment, while 1 (1.1%) event was observed in the presence of preserved flow throughout the intervention (p = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Flow impairment in the ICA during filter-based CAS is common and related to the type of filter used </plain></SENT>
