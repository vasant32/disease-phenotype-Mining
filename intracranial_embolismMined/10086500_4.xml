<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was: (1) to find a clinical indicator for revascularization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion using angiograms of 100 patients examined immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and treated medically and (2) to investigate 10 ultra-early <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> embolectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantity of collateral circulation, based on time required for conduction of contrast media to the insular portion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> from the anterior cerebral artery, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> conduction time (MCT) was graded as: Grade 1: In the arterial phase, there was conduction not only to the insular portion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> but also to proximal M2; Grade 2: Conduction to the insular portion was present in late arterial phase; Grade 3: Conduction was present in capillary phase; Grade 4: Conduction was present in venous phase; Grade 5: No conduction was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of embolectomy are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MCT can predict the extent of resultant low-density area on computed tomographic scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For Grades 3, 4, or 5, embolectomy could be considered superior to medical treatment, if the low-density area was localized in the basal ganglia or centrum semiovale after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, embolectomy was effective in four cases recanalized within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except for one Grade 5 case, the remaining nine cases showed neither lethal hemorrhagic infarction nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall outcome was significantly better than cases treated medically (p &lt; 0.05), but some cases did not recover from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the area of the lenticulostriate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MCT helps to predict the applicability of revascularization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of embolectomy depends on revascularization within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even after complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow restoration, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the area of the lenticulostriate arteries cannot always be prevented </plain></SENT>
