<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the primary origin of cerebrovascular symptoms in these patients is due to autochthonous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of small vessels or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> from large vessels is under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) indicative of an active embolic source can be recorded by transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report four patients (34, 44, 62 and 66 years old) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry's disease</z:e> from one kindred in whom we carried out microembolus detection recordings to disclose active embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients had had transient focal neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> and one had exercise <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, but no patient had clear evidence of disease of the large coronary vessels or brain-supplying arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were found in 1-hour recordings in any patients, supporting the hypothesis that early cerebrovascular symptoms arise from small vessel occlusion and not from embolic sources as an indicator of disease of large brain-supplying arteries or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
