<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>42 MRI of 36 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> were analysed retrospectively and compared with selective angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>92% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> proven by angiography were also detected by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The smallest and surgically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had a diameter of 2-3 mm on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were only demonstrated by selective angiography (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This concerned 5 mm sized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> located at the anterior communicating artery (2) and middle cerebral artery (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand 2 thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were only delineated by MRI (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> could not be demonstrated by angiography extensions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were underestimated in 44% (n = 16) angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 2.5 cm sized lobulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the internal carotid artery was initially evaluated by MRI as being thrombosed subtotally, due to flow-phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiography though showed a wide perfused lumen without visible <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the internal carotid artery was shown by MRI during septic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case the number of angiographic controls could be reduced by use of MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, MRI was not able to substitute selective angiography, especially to exclude under 6 mm sized <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MRI could not demonstrate clearly the vessels in the neighbourhood of saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> preoperatively </plain></SENT>
