<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that there are currently 33.5 million U.S. patients on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> have been shown to have pleiotropic including anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the pharmacological effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> administered alone and in combination with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in large clot embolized New Zealand white rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For these studies, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg, SC in DMSO) was administered 24 and 4 h prior to large clot embolization in order to achieve a "loading dose" pretreatment with the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In combination studies, tPA (3.3 mg/kg, IV) was administered 1 h following embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenous tPA administration significantly increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volume by 175% (p=0.015) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> incidence by 60% (p&gt;0.05) compared to control, but did not affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> incidence or volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment significantly decreased tPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> incidence (p=0.022) and volume (p=0.0001) following embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment blocks or attenuates mechanisms involved in tPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based upon our results, patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment may have significantly reduced tPA-induced side effects should they require tPA administration following an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
