<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Any monitoring technique that exposes the systemic circulation to atmospheric pressure could introduce gaseous microemboli, causing cerebral microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of carotid artery gaseous microemboli was studied during left atrial catheter insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Twelve patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Perioperatively, a 5-MHz continuous wave Doppler probe was positioned over the left carotid artery to maximally record blood flow signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The criteria used for detecting a gaseous microembolus were a sudden increase in the amplitude of the visual signal by 30% and a characteristic audible sound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Numbers of microemboli at three timepoints (before and during left atrial catheter insertion and during catheter flushing) were assessed using the Friedman test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No emboli were detected before left atrial catheter insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When compared with the preinsertion time period, statistically (p &lt; 0.05) significant numbers of gaseous microemboli were found in six patients during catheter insertion (3 +/- 1 microemboli; range 1 to 7 microemboli) and in five patients during catheter flushing (5 +/- 2 microemboli; range 1 to 12 microemboli) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for patients with lower filling pressures to entrain more microemboli during insertion (r = 0.44; p = 0.149) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient showed evidence of gross neurologic dysfunction postoperatively, although sensitive neurologic testing was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Left atrial catheter insertion and flushing can cause systemic gaseous microemboli in more than 50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although the number of microemboli introduced is relatively small, extreme care should be used during left atrial catheter insertion </plain></SENT>
