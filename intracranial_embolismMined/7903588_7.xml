<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of the transcranial Doppler to insonate the middle cerebral artery has allowed us to detect microembolic events in some of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with long term implantation and frequent microemboli appear to be more prone to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of 26 patients with mechanical valves revealed 14 with detectable microemboli, four of whom experienced central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Modifications in the medical or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> regimes have not been successful in decreasing or eliminating these microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the transcranial Doppler is a non-invasive means of quantifying these microemboli, it may become a useful tool in identifying those patients in need of a new type of antithrombotic regimen, or even a valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler could thus provide advance warning before a catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> occurs </plain></SENT>
