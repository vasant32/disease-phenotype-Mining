<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The BEACH trial evaluated the outcomes of carotid artery stent placement with distal emboli protection, using the Carotid Wallstent and the FilterWire EX/EZ(TM), in patients at high surgical risk for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 747 patients at high surgical risk for CEA due to prespecified anatomical criteria and/or medical comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The trial included both symptomatic (&gt;50% carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>) as well as asymptomatic (&gt;80% carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>) high surgical risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups of patients were included in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Roll-in (R) group (n = 189/747, [25%]) included up to nine patients per site for familiarization of the device and protocol; the Pivotal (P) group (n = 480/747, [65%]) was intended for presentation to the FDA for consideration of device approval; and a Bilateral (B) registry group (n = 78/747, [10%]) was included because of the need to treat patients with bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 480 Pivotal patients, anatomic criteria represented the most frequent high-risk surgical category for enrollment (58.8%), followed by prior CEA (34.2%), multivessel (&gt;or=2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (21.7%), and contralateral carotid occlusion (18.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The technical success rate for stent deployment and FilterWire EX/EZ deployment and retrieval was 98.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean postprocedure angiographic diameter stenosis in the Pivotal group was reduced to 10.8%, while the overall procedure success rate (&lt;50% residual diameter stenosis) after stent deployment was 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30 day composite major adverse event (MAE) rate for the entire cohort of 747 patients (i.e. inclusive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups) was 5.8% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> = 1.5%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> = 4.4%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) = 1.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analysis, there was no significant difference in the MAE rate between the three groups (P = 5.8%, R = 6.9%, B = 2.6%, P = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The similarity in periprocedural event rates for the Pivotal and Roll-in groups suggests a flat learning curve for experienced operators using this carotid stent system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The similarity in event rates for the Bilateral group, when compared with the Roll-in and Pivotal groups, suggests that staged sequential treatment of bilateral stenoses may be performed at the same risk as for unilateral lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 30-day safety of this stent and distal emboli protection system is encouraging and compares favorably with other carotid stent trials in high surgical risk patients </plain></SENT>
