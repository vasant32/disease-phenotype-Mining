<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Infants with <z:mp ids='MP_0001575'>cyanotic</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> are at risk for cerebral arterial gas embolism (CAGE) from iv infusion lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concern about the hazards and difficulty of caring for such patients inside a hyperbaric chamber may deter referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a complex case in which a small infant was managed successfully using a modified hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A four-month-old 6.19 kg male infant with a recent Glenn shunt for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001719'>double-outlet right ventricle</z:hpo> had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and became unstable immediately after an iv drug infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was sedated, intubated and ventilated and dobutamine was commenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A computerized tomography (CT) scan performed ten hours later demonstrated three intracranial air bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>About ten hours later the patient was referred for HBOT which commenced soon afterwards in a multiplace chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> would greatly increase the risk of decompression illness from breathing hyperbaric air HBOT was modified by the use of an abbreviated schedule at reduced pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two 90-min HBOT sessions were administered within 24 hr at 38 feet of sea-water pressure, equivalent to 2.15 atmospheres absolute without any air break </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During treatment the infant was ventilated using an Oxford Penlon ventilator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A subsequent CT scan demonstrated the absence of air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After extubation he appeared neurologically intact except for some <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the left arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hyperbaric oxygen may be utilized to treat CAGE in small infants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> and should be commenced promptly </plain></SENT>
