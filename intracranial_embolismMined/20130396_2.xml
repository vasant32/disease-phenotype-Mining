<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiac multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is less dependent upon the patient's condition and may be valuable in the diagnosis of embolic sources when the patient's cooperation is limited due to a neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role has never been validated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism is assumed to be embolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients who were admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> from May 1, 2007 to November 30, 2007 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were (1) any cardiac evidence of high-risk embolic sources for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, or (2) radiological or (3) clinical evidence of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography first, and then cardiac MDCT or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was attempted, if possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results and feasibility of cardiac MDCT and TEE were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and forty-three patients met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac MDCT was performed in 124 patients (86.7%), TEE in 83 patients (57.3%), whereas 75 patients (52.4%) underwent both studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>Renal insufficiency</z:hpo> for cardiac MDCT and lack of cooperation for TEE were found to be the most impeding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with both evaluations, cardiac MDCT identified a high-risk intracardiac embolic source in 8 and an extracardiac source in 20, while TEE found an intracardiac source in 1 and an extracardiac source in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences were found with respect to detecting cardioembolic sources and high-risk aortic atheroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac MDCT is a feasible and accurate diagnostic tool for embolic sources in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> setting </plain></SENT>
