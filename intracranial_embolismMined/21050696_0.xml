<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous recanalization of the extracranial portion of the ICA occlusion of atherosclerotic or embolic origin is only anecdotally reported, and data are lacking about its incidence, natural history, and outcome in long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with ICA occlusion were prospectively identified and followed-up to detect the incidence of a spontaneous recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with objectively confirmed recanalization were prospectively followed-up to observe their natural history and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of new cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICA occlusion and spontaneous recanalization were diagnosed by means of color-coded Doppler ultrasound imaging or selective contrast angiography, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated and treated for atherosclerotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Spontaneous recanalization occurred in 16 of 696 patients (2.3%; 95% confidence interval, 1.3%-3.7%) with ICA occlusion after a mean interval of 38 months from the diagnosis of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous recanalization was detected with color-coded Doppler ultrasound imaging and with selective contrast angiography, with a complete agreement of diagnostic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented with symptomatic spontaneous recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with spontaneous recanalization were asymptomatic after a mean follow-up of 66.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous recanalization of previously occluded extracranial ICAs is more frequent than anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Once it occurs, spontaneous recanalization seems to have a benign long-term course </plain></SENT>
