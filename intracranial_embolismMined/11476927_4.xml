<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies showed a preference of microemboli to the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that placement of the aortic cannula tip within the aorta descendens rather than in the aorta ascendens as commonly used reduces the number of microemboli to the brain and also reduces the side preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 60 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting primarily randomized to either a short aortic cannula (aorta ascendens) or an elongated one (aorta descendens), 29 (16 and 13) patients had complete and technically perfect continuous intraoperative transcranial Doppler sonography with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of high-intensity transient signals (HITS) was 994 +/- 2118 (mean +/- SD) for the short cannula group and was significantly lower with the elongated cannula (223 +/- 208; p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HITS counts per min also differed significantly in favour of the aorta descendens group (p &lt; 0.02), but there was an overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, elongated cannulas can reduce, but not prevent microembolism to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The side-to-side ratio of microemboli revealed more events in the left hemisphere, but this was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that individual anatomic factors may be responsible for this hemodynamically-mediated effect </plain></SENT>
