<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations have shown numerous fatty microemboli, which we previously termed small capillary and arteriolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> (SCADs), in brain microvessels of patients who died after cardiac surgery assisted by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis of this study was that extraneous trace elements such as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28984">aluminum</z:chebi> (Al) and silicon (Si) might be contaminating the blood and causing the formation of SCADs or coating the SCADs already formed in the extracorporeal circulation during CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small capillary and arteriolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> were identified in thick celloidin sections of the brains of 8 patients who died after cardiac surgery supported with a membrane oxygenator, and of 2 dogs that underwent CPB with a bubble oxygenator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sections were infiltrated with Spurr's embedding medium for electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resin sections 0.5 microm thick were placed on 100-mesh copper grids and analyzed with laser microprobe mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain sections without SCADs from 3 patients (controls) whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were not related to cardiac surgery were processed similarly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SCADs and nearby neuropil sites of the 8 patients who had cardiac surgery, both Al and Si values were higher than in the neuropil, including vessels of the 3 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Si values were also high in the 2 dogs, in which a bubble oxygenator was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that contamination with Al and Si continues to occur during cardiac surgery assisted by CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data also suggest that switching to membrane oxygenators from bubble oxygenators for CPB may have reduced Si contamination of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further refinements of CPB aimed at eliminating microemboli formation and Al and Si entry into the circulation are warranted </plain></SENT>
