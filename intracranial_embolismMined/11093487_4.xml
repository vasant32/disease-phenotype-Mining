<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mobile atheromas of the thoracic aorta have been identified as a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective study was undertaken to identify mobile atheromas and to determine the incidence of immediate postoperative embolic events after suitable surgical modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Late clinical events attributable to embolization were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1993 and July 1997, 3,660 patients scheduled for CABG underwent intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography to identify aortic atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease was graded as follows: grade I, plaques extending less than 5 mm into the aortic lumen; grade II, plaques extending more than 5 mm into the aortic lumen; and grade III, plaques with a mobile element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only patients with grade III atheromas were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various surgical modifications were done depending on the location of the lesion, eg, aortic arch atherectomy, CABG combined with transmyocardial laser revascularization, off-pump CABG by median sternotomy, and minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measured outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and other vascular events, both early (within 1 week) and late (1 to 5 years) after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 3,660 patients, 104 (2.84%) had mobile atheromas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 0.96%, and the incidence of other vascular events was 1.92% at 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no embolic event in the group of 88 patients who underwent off-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the study group, 98.07% are in regular follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 5 years, 1 patient had had a nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 2 patients had died of causes unrelated to atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was very low in patients with mobile aortic atheromas who underwent CABG after modification in surgical technique, especially off-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A follow-up of 5 years showed that patients with mobile atheromas have a very low incidence of spontaneous embolization </plain></SENT>
