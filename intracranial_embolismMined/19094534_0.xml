<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before implantation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received treatment of three or more inotropic drugs at maximal dosages, 6 patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, 4 patients required cardio-pulmonary resuscitation treatment and 3 patients suffered from definite function defect of liver and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> included ECMO for 8 patients, BVS5000 and MEDOS for 1 patient respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> supporting was 3 to 44 d with a mean of (11.5 +/- 13.9) d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients were successfully supported for getting heart transplantation, 1 patient received kidney transplantation simultaneously </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> after 44 days' support and 1 died from multiple organ failure after 3 days' support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> treatment of 2 patients was terminated ahead of schedule by their family and the patients were lost finally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> devices for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> catastrophic situation appears warranted despite the abbreviated transplant evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is important for improving the outcomes with beginning <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> support before multiple organ system failure occurs, and accurately identifying individuals who can benefit from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
