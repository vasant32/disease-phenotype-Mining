<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed whether <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16112">chlorogenic acid</z:chebi> (CGA), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26004">phenylpropanoid</z:chebi> molecule that has multiple mechanisms of action would be useful to attenuate behavioral deficits associated with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> using the rabbit small clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model (RSCEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantal analysis for each treatment determines the quantity of microclots (mg) that produce neurologic dysfunction in 50% of a group of animals (P(50)), with intervention considered beneficial if it increases the P(50) compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CGA (50 mg/kg) injected 5 min post-embolization significantly increased behavioral function and the P(50) to 3.61+/-0.52 mg (n=19) compared to 1.58+/-0.15 mg (n=26) in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, CGA also increased the P(50) to 2.57+/-0.28 mg (n=18) when administered 1 h post-embolization, but was ineffective when given 3 h following embolization (P(50)=1.22+/-0.24 mg, n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For combination studies with the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), we used tPA at a standard dose of 3.3 mg/kg, which significantly increased the P(50) to 2.89+/-0.29 mg (n=17) when administered 1 h after embolization, but not 3 h after embolization (P(50)=1.54+/-0.27 mg, n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when tPA (3.3 mg/kg) was combined with CGA (50 mg/kg) and administered 3 h following embolization, there was a significant increase in behavioral function as evidenced by an increase in the P(50) value to 3.40+/-0.76 mg (n=23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, as a mono-therapy CGA effectively reduced behavioral deficits when given up to 1 h following embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was a synergistic effect of the combination of tPA with CGA when administered 3 h following embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that the therapeutic window for a standard effective dose of tPA could be increased by administration of CGA, suggesting that it may be most useful as a co-therapy with a standard thrombolytic treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
