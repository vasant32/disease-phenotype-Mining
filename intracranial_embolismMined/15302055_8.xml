<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cerebral injury, in both overt and subtle forms, is common following cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current methods of assessment, most commonly neuropsychological testing, have several limitations and do not accurately define the anatomical and functional injury that occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have assessed the degree of cerebral injury following on-pump and off-pump cardiac surgery using functional magnetic resonance imaging and correlated this with the severity of microembolism as measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen patients undergoing cardiac surgery (8 off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 4 on-pump CABG and 4 open-heart surgery) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain pre-operatively and 4 weeks post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The functional magnetic resonance images demonstrated brain activation during performance of a verbal working memory paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient had continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring intraoperatively using a recently validated technique (multirange, multifrequency Doppler) that allows rejection of artefacts and separation of gas and solid microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Covariate analysis of pre- and post-operative functional magnetic resonance images was performed to correlate local mean signal intensity change with the extent of gas and solid microembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median number of microemboli was 34 (range 10-176) in the off-pump group, 229 (range 127-314) in the on-pump CABG group, and 1220 (range 874-1261) in the open-heart group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of solid microemboli was significantly lower in the off-pump group in comparison to the on-pump CABG and open-heart groups (9 vs. 25 vs. 20%, respectively, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison of pre- and post-operative functional magnetic resonance images demonstrated an overall reduction in task-associated activation in the post-operative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, and paradoxically, in certain specific regions of interest there was an increase in the signal intensity which correlated with the total number of microemboli (r=0.9, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing on-pump surgery have a higher degree of gas and solid microembolism which correlates with post-operative cerebral functional MRI activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is known to be sensitive to a wide range of insults, it may prove to be a useful marker of perioperative cerebral injury that could help in the evaluation of potential cerebroprotective strategies </plain></SENT>
