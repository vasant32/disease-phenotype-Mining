<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transoesophageal approach affords consistently high quality images with excellent structural resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-hundred and eighty-one patients with clinically suspected infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> were studied, to evaluate the prognostic value of ascertaining the site of vegetations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them were 118 patients with vegetations attached to the aortic or mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were followed for a mean period of 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0577871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Mitral valve vegetations</z:e> were associated with a significantly higher incidence of embolic events than vegetations on aortic valves (25% vs 9.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation was higher in aortic than in mitral valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (6% vs 0%), as were the need for surgical intervention (11% vs 5.5%) and mortality (1.6% vs 0%) respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bivalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> was associated with an increased rate of complications: embolism (50%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation (15%), surgery (35%) and mortality (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, echocardiographically accessible risk factors for subsequent embolism were a vegetation size of more than 10 mm and mitral valve involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk factors associated with in-hospital fatality were embolism, a vegetation size of more than 10 mm, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318973" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Staphylococcus aureus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the site influences both the rate and the type of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Precise echocardiographic visualization of vegetations helps to stratify patients into a high-risk sub-group, perhaps warranting early prophylactic surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transoesophageal echocardiography may play an important role in assessing the clinical outcome for these patients </plain></SENT>
