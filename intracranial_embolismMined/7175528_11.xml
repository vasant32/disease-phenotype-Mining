<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of this intra-aneurysmal clot significantly altered the computed tomographic appearance of the giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Massive intra-aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> did not protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and the likelihood of rupture of a clot containing giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was not significantly different from that of a non-thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> from a thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and massive aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> leading to the formation of giant <z:chebi fb="107" ids="46670,9119">serpentine</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were documented, these are rare epiphenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of embolisation from a partially thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, which was documented in one case, would appear to be greater than that from a non-thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings in this series, and a review of literature, suggest that the presence of intra-aneurysmal clot in giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> has little prognostic significance and does not alter the management or outcome after treatment </plain></SENT>
