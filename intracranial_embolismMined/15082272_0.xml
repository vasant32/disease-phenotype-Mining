<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated serial changes in distal aortic arch or proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> excluded space after transaortic stent-grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four patients with true distal aortic arch or proximal descending thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated by stent-grafts introduced via proximal arch aortic incisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up included computed tomographs (CT) every 6 months in 31 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum dimensions for excluded space and aneurysmal diameters were measured and evaluated to determine whether the aneurysmal space had decreased or shrunken following this alternative procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (5.9%) were caused by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and a peri-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another case died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> a year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one cases (91%) survived during follow-up, but one case suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> (2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 10 to 72 months (average 39.3+/-27.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no aneurysmal ruptures during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Post-operative serial CTs showed a disappearance or a significant shrinkage of the excluded aneurysmal space in 30 of the 31 cases (97%); one case suffered endoluminal leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transaortic endovascular stent-grafting is feasible for distal aortic arch or proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The excluded aneurysmal space disappears or shrinks after successful stent-graft placement </plain></SENT>
