<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A lack of response of serum thyrotropin to thyrotropin-releasing hormone, indicative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e>, was found in 10 patients (13 percent), not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> whom had raised serum thyroid hormone levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These 10 patients were predominantly male, had no clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> and a relative excess of nonpalpable autonomous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040137" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid nodules</z:e> demonstrated with scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 10 patients had reversion to stable sinus rhythm after treatment with <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-131 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="617099">carbimazole</z:chebi>, either spontaneously or after direct current cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It would appear that clinically occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> can be identified consistently only with the thyrotropin-releasing hormone test and is the cause of "idiopathic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in a significant proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
