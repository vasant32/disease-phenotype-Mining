<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To compare the diagnostic yields of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism, 63 patients (mean +/- SD age 63 +/- 15 [range 18-87] years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> underwent both procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a potential cardiac source of embolism in 14% (nine) of the patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a potential cardiac source of embolism in 41% (26) of the patients; 27% (seven) of these patients had no clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities detected only by transesophageal echocardiography in the patients with unsuspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> in two, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> in two, left atrial appendage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in one, and myxomatous mitral valve in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 26 patients with an identified cardiac source of embolism were older (67.5 versus 59.4 years, p = 0.04), more frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (62% [16] versus 8% [3], p less than 0.0001), had a larger left atrium (43 versus 37 mm, p = 0.01) and more commonly had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (62% [16] versus 32% [12], p less than 0.02) than the 37 patients in whom no cardiac source of embolism was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of potential cardiac sources of embolism in patients with cerebral ischemic events </plain></SENT>
