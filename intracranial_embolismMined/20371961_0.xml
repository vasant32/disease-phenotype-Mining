<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present herein the case of a young man whose initial symptom was pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and who manifested TA 6 years later as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography confirmed bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion and a well-developed collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The stump of the occluded CCA has both proximal and distal ends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possibility of emboli from the occluded CCA (distal stump) seems to be the most probable explanation, as turbulent flow was detected at distal stump on color Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The carotid stump can be a potential source of emboli in TA as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
