<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Visual function was assessed by an independent ophthalmalogist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: One hundred consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent pre- and postoperative <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> fundoscopy and automated visual field analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative emboli were detected by continuous TCD monitoring of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperatively, six patients had fundoscopic evidence of silent <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolisation, five patients had visible emboli associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visual field analysis found no significant difference between ipsi- and contralateral eye scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only patients with occlusions of major <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels had clinically reduced visual function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively TCD identified embolisation in 83/91 of monitored operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, ipsilateral visual field scores deteriorated while contralateral eye scores remained unchanged, however only one new <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of TCD detected embolisation was not associated with a corresponding deterioration in postoperative visual function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) A group of patients can be identified who experience "silent" <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolisation prior to CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(2) Clinically significant <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolisation resulting from CEA is uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(3) CEA is associated with a deterioration in the visual field scores for the ipsilateral eye compared with the contralateral eye but the mechanism for this small but significant deterioration remains unclear </plain></SENT>
