<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Urokinase, a first generation fibrinolytic agent, has been used to liquefy such clots with some success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), a second generation fibrinolytic drug that may be safer and more effective, was studied to evaluate its ability to lyse clot in vitro and its reactivity in the brain and subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>t-PA seems to cause partial clot lysis in small dosages (3750 units/70-cc clot) and in a short time (15 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It seems to perfuse through the clot when injected in one place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It does not cause <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> when injected into the rat brain, but indeed seems to promote resorption of blood when the two are injected together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It does not cause aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> when injected into the cisterna magna of rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>t-PA may prove to be an important adjuvant to the stereotactic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It may be particularly helpful in lysing these clots to make possible more gentle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, removing the risk to surrounding brain of strong vacuum </plain></SENT>
