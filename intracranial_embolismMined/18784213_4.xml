<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> is a recognized complication occurring during endovascular coil embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, there has been much interest in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa inhibitors to treat such complications, but the evidence is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our use of one such agent, abciximab, which we commonly administer and believe to be a safe and suitable rescue agent in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases in which abciximab was administered in our institution between 2001 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was defined as no significant clinical sequelae compared with baseline status or clinical improvement (mRS &lt; 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor outcome was defined as no resolution of a new clinical deficit that developed postprocedure at 6 months (mRS &gt; 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic appearance of thromboembolic phenomena and posttreatment outcome was assessed with the Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI) scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were included, with good outcome observed in 30 (79%) and poor outcome in 8 (21%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiographic improvement based on TIMI scoring was seen in 24 (63%) patients, and no improvement was seen in 14 (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients (11%), good outcome was obtained at 6 months despite no angiographic improvement on TIMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No cases of intracranial rebleed or additional neurologic deficit following administration of abciximab were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this small retrospective series, abciximab was safe and effective when used as a rescue agent for thromboembolic complications encountered during coiling of intracerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
