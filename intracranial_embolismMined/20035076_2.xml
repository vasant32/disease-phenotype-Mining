<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A combined analysis was performed of the MAVErIC (Medtronic AVE Self-expanding CaRotid Stent System with distal protection) I and II trials to evaluate the safety and feasibility of this system among patients at high risk for surgical endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred ninety-eight patients were enrolled in the MAVErIC I (99 patients) and MAVErIC II (399 patients) studies from June 2001 to October 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were pooled for statistical analysis of a common primary end point, the 365-day rate of major adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up took place at 30 days, 6 months, and 365 days postprocedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 365-day major adverse event rate, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> within 30 days, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> from days 31 to 365 was 12.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of neurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through 365 days was 1.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 30-day major adverse event rate was 5.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses showed no notable differences in the 365-day major adverse event rate for symptomatic patients compared with asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> with carotid artery stenting with a self-expanding stent and distal embolic protection results in a low 30-day adverse event rate, including the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients at high risk for carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
