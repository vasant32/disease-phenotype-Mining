<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cumulative experience with the Novacor wearable electric left ventricular assist system (LVAS) now exceeds 850 recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pump inflow conduit (IFC) has been implicated in embolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical outcomes were compared for two IFC designs in a retrospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The original IFC (woven, unsupported, crimped polyester: control group) and an alternative IFC (knitted, gelatin-sealed, integrally supported, uncrimped polyester: test group) were utilized upon availability in North American and European centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> to 180 days postimplant were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred ninety patients implanted between August 1996 and August 1999, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two hundred eighty-eight received the control IFC and 202 received the test IFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The groups (control, test) were well matched for age (48, 49 years), etiology (idiopathic 53%[152 of 288], 55% [112 of 202]; ischemic 34% [97 of 288], 33% [66 of 202]) and mean observation time (97, 91 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) was 21% (60 of 288) in the control and 12% (24 of 202) in the test group (p = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for embolic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> were found to be preimplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (odds ratio 4.3), age above 50 years (odds ratio 2.1), and ischemic etiology (odds ratio 1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in survival between the groups (71% [205 of 288], 68% [137 of 202]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The alternative (test) IFC has significantly reduced the incidence of embolic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This improvement is likely due to increased resistance to deformation at implant, improved neointimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and more favorable blood flow characteristics within the conduit </plain></SENT>
