<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The indication for urgent cardiac surgical interventions in patients with active infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> has to be considered carefully following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, because of the high recurrence rate of such complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolisms</z:e> the prognostic benefit of urgent surgery has been discussed controversially as effective anticoagulation during open heart surgery may result in secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1978 and 1993 infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE) was proven in 288 consecutive and prospectively followed patients (131 females, 157 males; mean age 53.6 +/- 8.7 [9 to 81] years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To analyze potential benefits and risks of an urgent surgical intervention early after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262004" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic cerebral infarction</z:e>, cumulated survival rates were calculated for patients with and without surgical intervention with special reference to incremental risk factors and the timing of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 50 patients (17.4%) the clinical course was complicated by one, and in 58 patients (20.2%) by recurrent embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 80% the first embolism occurred within 33 days following the first manifestation of typical signs and symptoms of IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>80% of recurrent events were observed within 32 days following the initial embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>71% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> embolic events were cerebral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> corroborated by computed tomography (CCT), the clinical course was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in 12.5% while it was only 1.5% for patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of a lack of therapeutic alternatives, 22 of 49 patients with recurrent embolic events, of which at least one was cerebral, underwent urgent cardiac surgery within 4 to 366 hours after the first cerebral manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulated survival rate of patients operated within 72 hours after the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was significantly more favorable (p &lt; or = 0.000) than for unoperated patients or those who were operated after more than 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An embolic event during IE carries a more than 50% risk of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with short duration of signs and symptoms of IE and postembolic echocardiographic demonstration of persistent vegetations the probability is &gt; 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At least for those patients urgent surgical intervention to remove the source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and embolic hazard seems to be beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention using the heart-lung-machine should be performed within 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Such early timing results in a significant lower rate of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> (p &lt; or = 0.00) than a postponed operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>To exclude early reperfusion <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> fragmentation, CCT should be repeated directly preoperatively </plain></SENT>
