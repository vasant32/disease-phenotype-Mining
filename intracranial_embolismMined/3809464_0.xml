<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the non-thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, CT showed a homogeneous, primarily hyperdense space-occupying lesion with strong enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The partially thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> appeared hyperdense with hypodense or isodense portions in the plain CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The completely thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were isodense to hyperdense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In none of the 33 patients could perifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> be proved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A CT diagnosis was possible in every case of partially or non-thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative angiography in these cases was necessary only for purposes of vessel topography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five completely thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> could not be identified in either CT or the angiogram so that the diagnosis was not made until surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical findings of these five cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and 28 patients with signs of intracranial space-occupying lesions were diagnostically misleading, as they suggested an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
