<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effects of tadalafil (Cialis), a long acting PDE5 inhibitor, on brain cGMP levels, neurogenesis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and neurological function during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery in a rat model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats (n=28) were subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tadalafil was orally administered every 48 h at a dose of 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for 6 consecutive days starting 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control animals received the equivalent volume of saline at the same time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For mitotic labeling, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 100 mg/kg) was administered twice a day at 5, 6, and 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ELISA assays were performed to evaluate the specificity of the effect of tadalafil on cGMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with tadalafil at a dose of 2 or 10 mg/kg significantly improved neurological functional recovery compared with saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, tadalafil treatment increased cerebral vascular density and the percentage of BrdU-positive endothelial cells around the ischemic boundary compared with saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, tadalafil-treated rats showed greater ipsilateral SVZ cell proliferation than saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with tadalafil did not reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume when compared to the saline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tadalafil selectively increased cGMP but not cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cAMP) in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with tadalafil improved functional recovery, which was associated with increases of brain cGMP levels and enhancement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
