<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Multicenter Study of Perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> (McSPI) developed and validated a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Risk Index for estimating the likelihood that patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting will experience major perioperative neurologic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The International Council of Emboli Management (ICEM) Study Group has suggested that use of intraaortic filtration reduces adverse neurologic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to compare predicted and observed neurologic outcomes in patients receiving intraaortic filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From February 1999 to August 2000, 962 patients were enrolled consecutively in a prospective, nonvoluntary registry of intraaortic filtration in 15 European centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 447 underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, the target population for applying the McSPI <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Risk Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-five had incomplete data, yielding a study group of 402 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Risk Index was calculated for each patient, and the sum across patients yielded an expected number of neurologic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These were compared to observed events by confidence limits and goodness of fit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six neurologic events were observed (1.5%; 95% confidence limits 0.6-3.4%), roughly half the 13.7 predicted by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Risk Index (3.4%; 95% confidence limits 2.0-5.8%), P=0.03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adverse neurologic events associated with coronary artery bypass grafting in which intraaortic filtration was used were rare and fewer than expected on the basis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Risk Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rare occurrence of clinically relevant events precludes their use as primary endpoints for randomized clinical studies; however, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Risk Index provides a valuable benchmark in the absence of such studies </plain></SENT>
