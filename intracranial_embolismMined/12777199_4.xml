<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially, this was a result of careful autopsy observations, then followed by a series of in vivo studies in which aortic arch atheroma was identified by transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association of aortic arch atheroma with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is most likely causal, given that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk increases with increasing thickness of arch atheroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is quite a sharp increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk for atheroma of 4 mm or greater compared with lesser thicknesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis is suggested when <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> has occurred in which no obvious cardiac or arterial source of embolism is found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of aortic arch atheroma is usually detected by transesophageal echocardiography and sometimes by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is uncertainty about clinical management, particularly for secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Options include the use of antiplatelet agents, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, thrombolysis, or surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter two options have only been described rarely in case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the less invasive approaches, combination antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> is favored, or the use of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Aortic arch Related Cerebral Hazard (ARCH) trial is being conducted to determine which of these is more effective in minimizing a composite outcome cluster of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, peripheral embolism, or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other more general management strategies should include reasonably aggressive risk factor control with blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering therapies and, if indicated, careful diabetic control </plain></SENT>
