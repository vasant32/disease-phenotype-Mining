<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 36 (28%) had cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these 10, 5 had completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of definite embolic origin on the basis of clinical, angiographic, and computed tomographic findings; 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> of probable embolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the 36 patients had a definite peripheral vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, 6 of 36 consecutively identified patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> (17%) had definite embolic events and 8 of 36 (22%) had definite or possible embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cause of the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> and emboli is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> has been suggested, the high proportion (90%) of patients with interatrial shunting demonstrated by contrast echocardiography in this study suggests paradoxical embolization as a potential cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whatever its mechanism, the high prevalence of embolic events in this series strongly supports the premise that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> with embolic potential </plain></SENT>
