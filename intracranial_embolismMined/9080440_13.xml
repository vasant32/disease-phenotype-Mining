<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were produced photothrombotically in rat frontal cortex and brain excitability was assessed by a extracellular paired-pulse stimulation in coronal slices 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cortical lesions caused a reduction of inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent and grade of these electrophysiological effects depended on the depth of the lesion: in animals with a lesion affecting the deeper cortical layers a pronounced transcortical diaschisis was found, whereas animals with a shallow lesion showed only a slight ipsilateral affliction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study shows that focal lesions in the motor cortex cause widespread <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo>, probably resulting from deafferentation, and these may have a significant impact on recovery of function </plain></SENT>
