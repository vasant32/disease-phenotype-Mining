<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Embolization occurred approximately 36 hours following successful resuscitation of blood pressure, respirations, and neurologic function in a 21-year-old man who had sustained a massive chest wound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of pellet embolization was made within 8 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurologic deficits; however, fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> had occurred before surgery could be undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven similar cases are briefly reviewed and it is concluded that low velocity and low kinetic energy missiles are more likely to embolize, and that left lower extremity injuries are more frequently involved in embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of shotgun trauma to the chest cerebral embolization of pellets should be considered at any sign of neurologic change and skull films obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention is necessary before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
