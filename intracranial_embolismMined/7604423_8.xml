<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Controversy exists regarding whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> is due to embolism or whether it is always due to lipohyalinosis of small penetrating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that emboli can enter penetrating arteries in relation to the blood flow to these arteries and to the diameter of the emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We injected <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> spheres of three different mean diameters (31 +/- 4, 68 +/- 14, and 92 +/- 28 microns [n = 50 for each]) into one internal carotid artery of 3 monkeys for each sphere size (total, n = 9 monkeys) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After injection of spheres, monkeys were killed, the brains were removed and fixed in formalin, and serial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin sections of three coronal sections of the cerebrum were examined by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sphere diameter (n = 25 for each territory and sphere size) and distribution in circumferential and penetrating artery territories were measured with the use of an image analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Corrections were made for shrinkage of spheres during fixation and for the effect of random sampling of 10-microns sections through spheres of different diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean numbers of spheres for each size were significantly higher in circumferential than penetrating artery territories (P &lt; .05, t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When correction was made for the volume of brain supplied by each territory, there was no significant difference in the number of spheres in circumferential versus penetrating artery territories for the two smaller sphere sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For spheres of mean diameter of 92 microns, significantly more spheres entered circumferential rather than penetrating artery territories (P &lt; .05, t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of the total number of spheres that entered penetrating artery territories was 5%, 6%, and 1.4% for beads of 31 +/- 4, 68 +/- 14, and 92 +/- 28 microns mean diameter, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Small emboli can enter penetrating arteries and could therefore produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The majority of emboli, however, enter circumferential arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The larger the emboli, the more likely that they will enter circumferential arteries rather than penetrating arteries </plain></SENT>
