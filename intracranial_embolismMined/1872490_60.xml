<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A referral hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 122 patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, or peripheral emboli and an equal number of age- and sex-matched control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Evaluation using transesophageal echocardiography was done in case patients to detect protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta and in control patients for cardiac indications other than emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: Matched logistic regression showed that the presence of protruding atheromas was strongly related to the occurrence of embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% Cl, 1.6 to 6.5; P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, atheromas with mobile components were present only in case patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When known risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) were added to the model, the presence of protruding atheromas remained an independent risk factor for embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 3.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was also independently associated with embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 2.7), but <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was not (odds ratio, 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta can be detected by transesophageal echocardiography and should be considered as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and peripheral emboli </plain></SENT>
