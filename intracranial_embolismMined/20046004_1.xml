<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report four patients who demonstrated obvious signal changes of the substantia nigra in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was diagnosed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases, and none of the patients presented clinical deterioration in their course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolic mechanism might be more closely related to the secondary change of the substantia nigra than <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between secondary nigral degeneration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology or between the nigral lesions and recanalization of the middle cerebral artery remains unclear </plain></SENT>
