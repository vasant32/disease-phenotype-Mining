<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">Fructose</z:chebi>-1,6-bisphosphate (FDP) is a high-energy intermediate that enhances glycolysis, preserves cellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> stores, and prevents the increase of intracellular calcium in ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since it has been shown to provide metabolic support to the brain during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we planned this study to evaluate whether FDP is neuroprotective in the setting of combining hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>) and irreversible embolic brain ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty pigs were randomly assigned to receive 2 intravenous infusions of either FDP (500 mg/kg) or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first infusion was given just before a 25-minute period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> and the second infusion immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediately before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>, the descending aorta was clamped and 200 mg of albumin-coated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> microspheres (250-750 mm in diameter) were injected into the isolated aortic arch in both study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the study groups in terms of neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio was significantly lower (P = .015) and brain <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> levels (P = .013) were significantly higher in the FDP group compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher 8 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> (P = .049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The administration of FDP before and immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> combined with embolic brain ischemic injury was associated with significantly lower brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio and significantly higher levels of brain <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, as well as lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels 8 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FDP seems to protect the brain by supporting energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The neurological outcome was not improved, most likely resulting from the irreversible nature of the microsphere occlusion </plain></SENT>
