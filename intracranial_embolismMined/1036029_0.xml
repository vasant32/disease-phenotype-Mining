<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was 49 years old female with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, who had previously no history of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vertebral angiogram revealed a saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left vertebral artery at the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The preoperative neurological examination were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, except for the slight degree of the meningeal irritation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgical intervention was successfully performed on 39th day after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative course was eventful, presenting the typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>, which was complicated the accompanying signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The troublesome accompanying signs were chiefly automatic respiratory dysfunction (sleep-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo>, perspiration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>), and restless <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The postoperative vertebral angiogram showed the obliteration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and the sufficient circulation of the vertebrobasilar system, especially the posterior inferior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of "sleep-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>" was discussed in detail from the literatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to the above mentioned, it should be stressed that the recognition of "sleep-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>" and the other accompanying signs are important for the treatment of the patient with the brain stem lesion </plain></SENT>
