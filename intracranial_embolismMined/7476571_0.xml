<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine whether microemboli injected in a predetermined sequence would maintain that sequence once they came to rest in brain microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If so, the injection of different-colored microspheres at different times could be used to bracket-in-time emboli that are known to be released into the circulation during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We injected different-colored microspheres into the arterial circulation of anesthetized dogs before and after the injection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> and before and after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronal slices of the dog brains were embedded in celloidin, sectioned at 100 microns, and stained for alkaline phosphatase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The afferent cerebrovasculature stained dark brown against a light background, and the proximal/distal orientation of many of the arterioles could be determined by following their course within the thick sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When different types of emboli were found in a single arteriole, they appeared in the order injected or the order of occurrence in the bypass protocol in 99.3% of the 867 such arterioles counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the microemboli maintained their ordered sequence with only a very small degree of mixing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Once they came to rest, there was not sufficient collateral blood flow in the brain microvessels to move them into disordered positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This dog model should facilitate studies of the time of release of microemboli within narrower windows of time during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
