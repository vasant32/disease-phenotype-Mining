<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no previous publications evaluating homocyst(e)ine in young Asian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a case-control study examining homocyst(e)ine, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels in young, first-ever Asian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively recruited 109 consecutive young (&lt;50 years) first-ever hospitalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients and 88 age/gender-matched hospital-based controls during a period of 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of vascular risk factors was assessed; fasting homocyst(e)ine, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms were subtyped using TOAST study criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 43.8 (cases) and 43.1 (controls) years; 71.6% were male (cases and controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> were significantly more prevalent in cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean fasting homocyst(e)ine levels were significantly higher in cases (13.7 micro mol/L, 95% CI: 12.7 to 14.9) than controls (10.8 micro mol/L, 95% CI: 9.9 to 11.8, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in cases (299.5 pmol/L, 95% CI: 266.7 to 332.3) than controls (394.5 pmol/L, 95% CI: 357.9 to 431.0, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folate</z:chebi> levels were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean homocyst(e)ine levels were significantly elevated in large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (16.9 micro mol/L, 95% CI: 14.5 to 19.7, P&lt;0.001) but not other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with the lowest homocyst(e)ine quartile, the highest quartile was significantly associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 4.3 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 25.3 for large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Using a logistic regression model, the adjusted odds ratio was 5.17 (95% CI: 1.96 to 13.63, P=0.001) for every 1 micro mol/L increase in log homocyst(e)ine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> in young Asian adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The relationship between increasing homocyst(e)ine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk is strong, graded, and significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The association with large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> suggests that hyperhomocyst(e)inemia may increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk via a proatherogenic effect </plain></SENT>
