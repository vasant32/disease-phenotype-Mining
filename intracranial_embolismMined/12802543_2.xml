<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to compare the characteristics of J-shaped detachable <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coils with those of spiral coils in in-vitro vascular models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>J-shaped coils consist of distal semicircular and proximal straight segments, the latter extending for most of the length of the coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spiral coils have a helical shape memory and are thus limited in expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In in-vitro <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> vascular models simulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> and dural arteriovenous fistulae, we compared J-shaped and spiral coils with regard to ease of delivery, anchoring and folding patterns, and stability in various types of vascular lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delivery and retrieval were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In large and irregular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and venous sinuses, J-shaped coils could form a more complex basket which conformed to the shape of the vascular cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The J-shaped coil was always in contact with the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In wide-necked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, coil protrusion was more frequent with J-shaped coils, while spiral coils tended to stay compact and circular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arteries were occluded in a shorter segment with spiral coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>J-shaped coils were safe and superior for large and irregular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Spiral coils were preferable for spherical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and segmental occlusion of arteries </plain></SENT>
