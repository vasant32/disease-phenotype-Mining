<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We intended to find variables affecting recanalization and clinical outcome in patients with BA occlusion undergoing thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed in retrospect the clinical and angiographic data of a consecutive series of 51 patients treated with intra-arterial urokinase (n = 44; 0.3 to 1.5 mIU) or intravenous or intra-arterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (n = 7; 22 to 100 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified effective variables by multiple logistic regression analyses and univariate tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sites of occlusion were the caudal (n = 23), middle (n = 18), and distal (n = 10) segments of the BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis was embolism in 35 and local atherothrombosis in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collateral circulation was good in 32 patients and poor or absent in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was achieved in 26 of 51 (51%) patients and was associated with occlusions of embolic etiology (P = .0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 46% (12/26) in the recanalization group and 92% (23/25) in the nonrecanalization group (P = .0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other independent variables affecting mortality were length of BA obstruction (P = .0011), age (P = .0008), and collateral state (P = .0454) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After follow-up (median, 32 months), 10 of the 16 survivors were only minimally impaired, with a Barthel Index score of 95 or greater; 5 patients were moderately and 1 severely disabled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recanalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BA occlusion reduces mortality significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Length of BA obstruction and state of the collaterals are additional independent variables affecting survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Young patients with monosegmental embolic occlusion of the BA seem to have the best chance to considerably profit from thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
