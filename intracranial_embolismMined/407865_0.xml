<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They depend more on the quality of the investigations than upon age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the group which has been studied, slight or frank haemorrhagic complications (0.05/year/patient) were the result of a demonstrable overdosage in only one case in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were not responsable for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this series.--because of the referral patterns, the patients studied consisted of 79 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, 27 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo>, and 6 with thrombo-emoblic problems, not counting the 23 complications during the course of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In those patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, well-regulated <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment was associated with a favourable clinical course, and the correlation was significant.--there is not argument against the administering of a full and prolonged course of ACT to a patient of more than 75 years of age </plain></SENT>
