<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To present our experience with the use of primary stenting to treat embolic iliac <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Six patients (5 men; mean age 50.6+/-14.1 years range 37-72) underwent primary stenting for embolic occlusions lodged in the common iliac and/or external iliac arteries and were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probable reason for the embolism was <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in 4 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients, an additional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was demonstrated in the renal, mesenteric, popliteal, and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Iliac emboli were treated with primary implantation of self-expanding stents followed by very low-pressure balloon dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, primary stenting was technically successful and provided immediate recanalization with elimination or reduction of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no procedure-related complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the mean 11-month follow-up (range 1-18), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stented iliac arteries remained patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> at 21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although this experience is limited, excellent midterm results suggest that primary stenting may be a valuable alternative in the treatment of embolic occlusions of the iliac arteries in selected cases </plain></SENT>
