<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The usefulness and safety of percutaneous myocardial laser therapy in selected patients have been identified in previous 1-year randomized trial reports, including that from a double-blind, sham-controlled trial we independently conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether the 1-year effects are maintained through a long-term, longitudinal follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n=77) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, stable, medically refractory <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (class III or IV) not amenable to conventional revascularization and with evidence of reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, ejection fraction &gt; or =25%, and myocardial wall thickness &gt; or =8 mm were treated with percutaneous myocardial laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the 1-year follow-up and disclosure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> randomized assignments as prespecified in the respective study protocol, patients were followed up longitudinally for a mean of 3 years for <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> class, left ventricular ejection fraction, medication usage, and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No procedural mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pericardiocentesis was required in two patients (2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac event-free survival was 88% at 1 year and 66% at late follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean Canadian Cardiovascular Society <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> class was significantly improved from baseline (3.2+/-0.4) at 1 year (2.2+/-1.1, P&lt;0.001) and at a mean of 3 years (1.9+/-1.2, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nitrate usage was significantly reduced at late follow-up; however, ejection fraction did not change over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> improvement at 1 year was found to be a significant independent predictor of both survival and <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> improvement at late follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that percutaneous myocardial laser therapy in selected patients with severe, medically refractory <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> not treatable with conventional revascularization induces significant and sustained symptomatic benefit </plain></SENT>
