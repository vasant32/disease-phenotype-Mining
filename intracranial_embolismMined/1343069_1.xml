<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 129 patients, under 56 years of age, 144 from 56 to 69 and 75 over 70 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total observation period was 1089 patient-years (3.3 yrs per pt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>64% of the patients had adequate anticoagulation level (prothrombin time &lt; 35%, INR 2.2-4.5) 70 to 100% of the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin time was slightly, but significantly higher in the elderly group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During this period 21 patients developed major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications (1.84/100 pt yrs), 8 of them with fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo>, and 20 embolic complications (1.93/100 pt yrs), 3 of them fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the incidence of both <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and embolic complications were observed in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this retrospective follow-up study suggest that long term anticoagulation can be carried out in elderly pts with risk of hemorrhagic and embolic complications similar to those observed in the general population </plain></SENT>
