<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of diagnostic and therapeutical problems we hereby report on one case of a female adolescent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> who did not undergo surgical correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006695'>atrioventricular septal defect</z:hpo> because of early development of Eisenmenger's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was subacut and the diagnostic procedures were considerably delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in this case were preceding antibiotic treatments which increased the risk of selective growth of the causative germs as well as the tricuspidal valve incompetence with simultaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antimicrobial treatment was difficult due to resistance to antibiotic drugs generally applied in such cases and the restricted bacteriological diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally we had successfully administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The course was complicated by cerebral embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FACIT: Lactobacillus species are facultative pathogenic which should be consideration in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in children and adolescents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defects</z:hpo> and valve diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The determination of minimal bactericidal concentration of antibiotic agents and time-kill studies of combined antibiotics are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For initial therapy we recommend high dose <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> combined with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47779">aminoglycoside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cases of resistance <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> should be taken into account as second choice antibiotic drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The duration of antibiotic therapy should at least over six weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In cases of risk systemic embolization is suspected therapy with low dose acetylsalicyclic acid or cardiosurgery should be assumed as therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
