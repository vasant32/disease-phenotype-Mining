<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed 39 cases of intracranial vascular malformations, observed in the Section of Paediatric Neurosurgery of the Catholic University of Rome between 1980 and 1995 (age 1-15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was of parenchimal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> in 26 cases, in 7 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> of the Galen region, in 5 cases of dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> and in 1 case of venous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Haemorrhage was the prevalent clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in patients with parenchimal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> (57.7% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one patient with a Galen region <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> presented cardiovascular symptoms, while 2/5 children observed for a dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> complained a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total surgical excision was performed in 17 of the 26 patients with parenchimal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>; moreover surgery was combined with preoperative endovascular embolization in 2 cases and with radiosurgery in 1 patient; we think that surgery is still the treatment of choice in patients with parenchimal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment and radiosurgery have mainly an adjuvant role; nevertheless we agree that a preoperative endovascular management of parenchimal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> reduces the surgical risk, especially in cases of huge <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> localized in eloquent areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiosurgery may be an alternative choice for complex or deeply sited <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>; however in most cases, a combination with surgery or endovascular treatment is necessary to reduce the "target" size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> embolization was the only treatment in 2 of the 6 cases of dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>; dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> embolization was combined with surgery in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> exclusion is the treatment of choice in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgery may be combined with endovascular treatment in case of a partial persistence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, or if signs of revascularization are present on control angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A conservative management is justified in patients with carotido-cavernous fistulae; in fact a complete spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is very frequent in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A high rate of cardiovascular symptoms is reported in patients with Galen region <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> diagnosed in the 1st year of life, but only 1 of our patients complained of congestive cardiac symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment of Galen region <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> is associated with a high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Actually a transarterial embolization of afferent vessels represents the treatment of choice in these patients; it can be combined with transvenous approach in case of complex <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> and/or a non complete <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> exclusion </plain></SENT>
