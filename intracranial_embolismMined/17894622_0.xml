<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging abnormalities often develop in patients after invasive procedures associated with cerebral microembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microembolism has recently been shown during orthopedic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here examine the effects of intraoperative microembolism on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> magnetic resonance(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging in patients undergoing hip and knee replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 24 patients, at least 65 years old, requiring elective knee or hip replacement surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> with DW and axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging was performed pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were monitored intraoperatively for microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had intraoperative microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean number of emboli detected was 9.9 +/- 18 per surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was obtained a mean of 3.5 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No DW imaging abnormalities were found after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient had new findings on postoperative FLAIR imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intraoperative microembolism occurred universally, but did not lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DW imaging abnormalities following knee and hip replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> imaging abnormalities on FLAIR imaging are rare but may occasionally occur after joint surgery </plain></SENT>
