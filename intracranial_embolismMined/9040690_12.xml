<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral emboli</z:e> can be identified by the presence of typical microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in transcranial Doppler (TCD) spectral curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of this technique was studied by evaluating the prevalence and time course of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined the influence of anticoagulation therapy on the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another study objective was to identify the value of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in elucidation of the underlying pathology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used bilateral TCD monitoring of the middle cerebral artery to search for microemboli in 100 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonhemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monitoring time was for 30 minutes at admission (examination I), after 24 hours (examination II), and again after 48 hours (examination III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two of the 100 patients had to be excluded from the study after examination 1 because retrospectively they did not fulfill the inclusion criterion or because they had an insufficient bone window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty of the patients (51%) showed <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during at least one of the three TCD examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 9 of the 47 patients without <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during examination I (19%), <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> could be recorded subsequently during examinations II and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant decrease in the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> occurred between examinations I and III (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in a single patient decreased between examinations I and II but increased again in examination III, although it did not reach the initial level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was the highest during the period up to 6 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, even at &gt; 72 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, a substantial number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> could be recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 18 of the 21 patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion who showed <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (86%), these signals occurred ipsilateral to the affected carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 5 of the 13 patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and a potential cardiac source of embolism (38%), <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were observed bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients were without anticoagulation treatment at the time of examination: 19 of these patients (46%) presented with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In contrast, of the 37 patients receiving anticoagulation treatment at the time of the first examination, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> could be recorded in only 12 (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microemboli are a frequent phenomenon in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> arising from a variety of causes, both in the very early stages and several days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> decreases significantly over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> occur more frequently in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> than in patients with a potential cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> are frequent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, whereas bilateral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> are suggestive of a cardioembolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation treatment appears to decrease the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, but microemboli still occur in patients receiving intravenous therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> occur intermittently, TCD examinations should be repeated several times, even in patients without <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the first examination, and long-term monitoring equipment is necessary </plain></SENT>
