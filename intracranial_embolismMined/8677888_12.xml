<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Framingham Study found that relative weight was not a risk factor for new ABI in older men but was a weak risk factor for new ABI in older women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Barrett-Connor and Khaw found no association between body mass index and new ABI in older men or women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was not a risk factor for new ABI in older men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was a risk factor for new ABI in older women by univariate analysis but not by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, because <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is associated with other risk factors for ABI and new coronary events, we would try to lower weight in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> older men and women </plain></SENT>
