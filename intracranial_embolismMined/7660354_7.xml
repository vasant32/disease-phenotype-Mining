<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) supplementation on the thrombolytic efficacy of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), platelet aggregability, serum cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats (6 weeks old) received dietary DHA supplementation (300 mg/kg per day) for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rat middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was occluded by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> induced by photochemical reaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and green light which cause endothelial damage followed by platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, aggregation and formation of a platelet and fibrin-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> at the site of photochemical reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood flow was monitored using a laser Doppler flowmeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rt-PA was administered 30 min after the middle cerebral artery had been occluded by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This regimen produced a significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in serum free-cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> levels, inhibited platelet aggregation ex-vivo induced by collagen in whole blood (P &lt; 0.05), reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> (TX) B2 formation (P &lt; 0.01) in whole blood and prolonged the time for thrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (P &lt; 0.01) as compared with values obtained from animals on standard diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, dietary DHA enhanced thrombolytic efficacy of rt-PA and reduced the size of ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that dietary DHA produces antithrombotic effects via metabolic conversion to non-atherogenic and non-platelet stimulant metabolites </plain></SENT>
