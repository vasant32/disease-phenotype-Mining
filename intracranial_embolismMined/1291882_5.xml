<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The short-term outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is known to be strongly dependent on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, especially favoring patients having suffered a lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes as long-term predictors of survival has not been firmly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the 1-year survival from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the Klosterneuburg <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Data Bank, which since 1988 systematically collects data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients treated in one center in Lower Austria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative survival of 398 consecutive patients (mean age 67.7 +/- SD 11.6) 1 year after a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was not only adversely related to age but also appeared to be age independent when compared according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative survival rates (CSR) ranged from 88.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 82-92] for lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (n = 107) to 68.1 (CI: 50-79) for atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (n = 69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiogenic embolism (n = 68) showed a CSR of 72.1 (CI: 61-83) similar to the group of cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (n = 121, CSR: 74.4, CI: 67-82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CSR for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n = 33) was 68.8 (CI: 53-85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the comparatively favorable prognosis of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> must be recognized in trials designed to evaluate efficacy in terms of 1-year mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has an almost identical survival rate when compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> caused by cardiogenic embolism it may be assumed that a considerable number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> for which no cause can be found are, in fact, cardiogenic embolic </plain></SENT>
