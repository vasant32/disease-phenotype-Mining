<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A major concern during carotid artery stent placement is the potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diminishing the number of device manipulations across the lesion might reduce procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we report our initial experience with carotid stent placement without the use of either balloon angioplasty or distal protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven consecutive patients with 100 carotid stenoses compose this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety four of the 100 hundred stented carotid arteries were either symptomatic (58 [58%]) or had a greater than 70% stenosis (36 [36%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six percent of them were asymptomatic and had stenosis between 50% and 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent neurologic evaluation before the procedure and during follow-up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carotid sonography and plain films of the neck were performed immediately after the procedure and then at the same time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary stent placement was successful in 98 of 100 case subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 2 case subjects, predilation was necessary before stent deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurologic periprocedural complications included 1 nondisabling and 1 disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 23 months (range: 10-36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, there were 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unrelated to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e>, and no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The degree of stenosis decreased from a mean of 78.85% before the procedure to a mean of 21.23% immediately after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this series, carotid stent placement without the use of either balloon angioplasty or distal protection devices was safe and effective with a low incidence of periprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
