<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even though amyloid beta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (Abeta) play a prominent role in the initiation and progression of cellular dysfunction in AD, the precise in vivo actions of various Abeta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebrovascular actions of the major Abeta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (1-40) and (1-42) in live animals were investigated using an open cranial window technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that the Abeta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> cause vascular lesions, especially in the arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one set of experiments, leukocytes and platelets were tagged with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52672">Rhodamine 6G</z:chebi>, soluble Abeta(1-40) infused intravenously for 2 minutes, and the vasculature video recorded for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a second set of experiments, soluble Abeta(1-40) infusion was followed 30 minutes later by an infusion of soluble Abeta(1-42) and the vasculature recorded for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent and transmission electron microscopic examinations demonstrated the following cerebrovascular action of Abeta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>: endothelial cell damage, leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, platelet activation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, impeded blood flow, and smooth muscle cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vascular disruption observed were similar to those observed in the brains of some AD patients and may represent the initial phase of a vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of Abeta(1-40) and (1-42) produced significantly more vascular disruption than Abeta(1-40) alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> in ovariectomized female rats protected them from the deleterious actions of Abeta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reported protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> against AD may be mediated in part through prevention of cerebrovascular Abeta toxicity </plain></SENT>
