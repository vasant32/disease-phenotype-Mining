<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in animals with a diseased vascular system, thrombolysis was carried out in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after clot embolism of the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hours after embolism SHR were treated with either recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or saline, and neurological deficits and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> were evaluated after 3 days survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rt-PA-treated SHR exhibited a significantly higher incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> than untreated rats but neurological deficits and survival rates showed a non-significant trend for improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This model offers the possibility of investigating the pathophysiology of post-thrombolytic complications in a clinically relevant small animal model </plain></SENT>
