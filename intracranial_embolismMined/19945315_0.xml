<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Filter-protected transcervical carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been suggested to reduce the intraoperative cerebral embolisation observed during transfemoral CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated clinical outcome and incidence of ischaemic lesions at diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) after transcervical and transfemoral CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 2007 to May 2009, we performed filter-protected CAS in 135 patients with symptomatic (30%) or asymptomatic (70%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> above 70% and below 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 44 patients with risky femoral access or unfavourable aortic arch <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, access to common carotid artery was achieved by a small cervical incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another 91 procedures we used a classic percutaneous femoral access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and postoperative DW-MRI scans were obtained after 111 procedures (82%) - 35 transcervical and 76 transfemoral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of clinical events (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) was 2.3% after transcervical CAS and 19.8% after transfemoral CAS (P&lt;0.01), without any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI disclosed new ischaemic lesions in five patients (5/35, 14.3%) after transcervical CAS and in 28 patients (28/76, 36.8%) after transfemoral CAS (P=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ischaemic lesions depicted after transcervical procedures were ipsilateral to the treated artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcervical filter-protected CAS, compared with classic percutaneous procedures, seems to reduce clinical events and DW-MRI ischaemic damage and may be useful in selected patients </plain></SENT>
