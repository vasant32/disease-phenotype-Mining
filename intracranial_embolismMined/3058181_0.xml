<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the device was used only after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other therapeutic modalities had failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The periods of support ranged from 2.5 to 31 days, mean of 10 days </plain></SENT>
