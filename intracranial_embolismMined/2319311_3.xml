<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of these patients were studied and compared to those of 71 patients without this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following characteristics were found to correlate with retrograde <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>: 1) advancing age of the patient; 2) large <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> size; and 3) markedly dilated and elongated feeders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the slow flow in the former feeding arteries that was observed immediately after <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> removal and pathological changes in these vessels due to long-standing hemodynamic stresses contributed to the development of retrograde <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological manifestations related to retrograde <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were noted in three of the five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although infrequent, this complication should be considered as a serious possibility following removal of an <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
