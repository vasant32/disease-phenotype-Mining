<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that treatment of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rhtPA) alters cerebral expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by a single fibrin-rich clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P-selectin, E-selectin, and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) immunoreactivity was measured at 6 or 24 hours after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in control rats and in rats treated with rhtPA at 1 or 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine the therapeutic efficacy of combined rhtPA and anti-ICAM-1 antibody treatment at 4 hours after embolization, ischemic lesion volumes were measured in rats treated with rhtPA alone, rats treated with rhtPA and anti-ICAM-1 antibody, and nontreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Administration of rhtPA at 1 hour after embolization resulted in a significant reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule vascular immunoreactivity after embolization in the ipsilateral hemisphere compared with corresponding control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when rhtPA was administered to rats at 4 hours after embolization, significant increases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral hemisphere were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase of ICAM-1 immunoreactivity was also detected in the contralateral hemisphere at 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in lesion volume was found in rats treated with the combination of rhtPA and anti-ICAM-1 antibody compared with rats treated only with rhtPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the time of initiation of thrombolytic therapy alters vascular immunoreactivity of inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in the ischemic brain and that therapeutic benefit can be obtained by combining rhtPA and anti-ICAM-1 antibody treatment 4 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
