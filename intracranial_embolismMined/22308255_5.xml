<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The cost-effectiveness of dabigatran for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> has not been directly assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed using data from the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Therapy (RE-LY) trial, other trials of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and the published cost of dabigatran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the cost and quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with 150 mg dabigatran twice daily versus <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy targeted to an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The target population was a cohort of patients aged â‰¥70 years with nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and no contraindication to anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the base case, dabigatran was associated with 4.27 quality-adjusted life-years compared with 3.91 quality-adjusted life-years with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dabigatran provided 0.36 additional quality-adjusted life-years at a cost of $9000, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $25,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran was inversely related to the quality of international normalized ratio control achieved with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Monte Carlo analysis, dabigatran was cost-effective in 57% of simulations using a threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year and 78% of simulations using a threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dabigatran appears to be cost-effective relative to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our analysis is limited by its reliance on data from a substudy of a single randomized trial, and our results may not apply in settings with uncommonly good international normalized ratio control using <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
