<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It encompasses several clinical entities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the underlying pathophysiological mechanism is the same, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and cerebrovascular disease frequently coexist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is routinely done in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> to exclude possible cardiac sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the introduction of multiplane transesophageal transducers, it has become easier to visualize the proximal coronary arteries during transesophageal examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report three cases in which routine TEE for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> revealed significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> that was not previously suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was so severe that further evaluation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was not deemed useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other two patients underwent coronary angiography based on the echocardiographic findings, confirming the lesions noted on the echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, both patients were successfully revascularized: one by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and the other by coronary artery bypass graft surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the examination of coronary arteries during routine TEE for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> may become a useful screening tool for the detection of coexisting, asymptomatic, significant proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
