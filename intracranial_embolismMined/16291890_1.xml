<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The pathogenesis of deep white matter medullary (WMM) artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we analysed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patterns of WMM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> using diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) to detect embolic signals and investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes according to the Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified WMM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on DWI using templates to determine the subcortical vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We classified WMM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> into those with small artery disease (SAD), large artery disease (LAD), cardioembolism (CE), two or more aetiologies, or undetermined aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical course, risk factors, and cortical spotty lesions were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1420 consecutive patients, 103 (7.3%) met the criteria for WMM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were as follows: 65 (63.1%) patients with LAD, 18 (17.5%) with SAD, 12 (11.7%) with CE, four (3.9%) with two or more aetiologies, three (2.1%) with undetermined aetiology, and one (1.0%) with other determined aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LAD (87.7%) or CE (83.3%) was significantly accompanied by cortical embolic signals as compared to SAD (0%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LAD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were larger and tended to be chain-like in shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence was more common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with cortical embolic signals than in those without embolic signals (18.9% v 0%, p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In present study, the most common pathogenesis of WMM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was LAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that WMM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> accompanying cortical embolic signals warrant evaluation of the underlying embolic sources in the large artery or the heart </plain></SENT>
