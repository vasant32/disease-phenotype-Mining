<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Placement of a carotid artery stent (CAS) is an appealing treatment option for patients who have undergone neck irradiation or endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early outcomes and restenosis rates in these patients were analyzed and compared with those in de novo lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-center, retrospective review of 269 CAS procedures that used cerebral embolic protection and nitinol stents was conducted from May 2001 through July 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this cohort, 66 procedures were performed in patients with a history of external-beam neck irradiation (n=26) or carotid endarterectomy (CEA; n=40), designated as the "hostile neck" group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 30-day event rate for the entire group included major ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1.1%), minor posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1.1%), and myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (0.4%); none occurred in the hostile neck group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of restenosis or occlusion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 269 arteries was 2.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in restenosis or occlusion rates between de novo lesions (2.0%, four of 203) and the hostile neck group (4.5%, three of 66; P=.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat angioplasty with or without stent implantation was employed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with restenosis and resulted in no periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or subsequent restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Periprocedural outcomes of CAS procedures are similar in de novo lesions as in patients with a history of neck irradiation or CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, restenosis requiring repeat intervention remains uncommon, and its incidence is comparable between groups </plain></SENT>
