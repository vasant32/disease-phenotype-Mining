<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were followed for an average of 10 years to determine whether they experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> less often than expected on the basis of age- and sex-specific incidence rates of each event known for the Rochester population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In none of these disease entities, separately, or combined, was the expected number significantly different from the observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, when we examined these events separately by sex, observed numbers in males were 30 to 50% less than expected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four studied end-events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because the male population was small, none of these differences reached statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible effect of aspirin in the primary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in males is discussed in light of the recent similar reported results in secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
