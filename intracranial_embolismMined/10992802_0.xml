<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we undertook to identify the characteristic features on magnetic resonance images of patients who had suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> (CE), as classified by TOAST (possible and probable) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> from the Yonsei <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry (YSR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the TOAST classification, 92 patients were identified to have a potential cardiac source of embolism (PCSE), in which 69 patients were found to have high-risk PCSE and 23 patients medium-risk PCSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To compare their imaging characteristics, another group of 49 patients who were found to have had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to large artery-to-artery (ATA) embolism-common or internal carotid artery (CCA, ICA)-were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the simultaneous superficial and deep territories (58.7%; 6.1%, p &lt; 0.001), and combined new anterior and old posterior circulation (15.2%; 2.0%, p = 0.016) were more frequent in PCSE than ATA embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral anterior hemispheric involvement was also more frequent in the PCSE group, but it did not reach statistical significance (13.0%; 4.1%, p = 0.090) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ATA embolism tended to involve only superficial territories compared to PCSE (71.4%; 28.3%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no topographic differences between the high-risk and medium-risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With respect to the etiology of PCSE in our population, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Characteristic MRI features of patients with PCSE, which were not documented previously by computed tomography (CT) included: old and new, involvement of multiple different vascular territories, bilateral anterior hemisphere, as well as anterior and posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These MRI features, together with simultaneous superficial and deep territorial involvement, help to differentiate the underlying embolic sources, whether they are cardiac or ATA in origin </plain></SENT>
