<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>Cyanosis</z:hpo> in conjunction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> does not necessarily indicate the Eisenmenger syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exceptionally, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> may result from tricuspid regurgitant flow and its unusual direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe thirteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> and accompanying <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them, the tricuspid regurgitant jet was oriented towards the interatrial septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was found on the basis of echocardiographic examination and subsequent frame-by-frame analysis of videotape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of thirteen patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> was observed in 7 (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among those seven, three had moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) between 40 and 60 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining four patients with marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (PASP &gt; 60 mm Hg) underwent cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated low values of pulmonary artery resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Except for the one patient with a history of the cerebral embolic event, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were qualified for cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the postoperative observation they were uneventful and showed clinical recovery and echocardiographic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Appreciable arterial desaturation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>, regarded as uncomplicated, should be followed by careful investigation for the direction of tricuspid regurgitant flow </plain></SENT>
