<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under light anesthesia, main trunk of cerebral artery was embolized with a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> cylinder (500 microns in diameter and 1 mm in length) through the cervical internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rat brain was frozen in situ at 1 or 3 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some rats Evans blue was injected into the peritoneal cavity 30 minutes before freezing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Caudate putamen and cortex were often acidotic but thalamus, hypothalamus, and hippocampus were composed of both acidotic and alkalotic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exudation of Evans blue was frequently detected in the alkalotic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ATP was decreased partially in the acidotic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the alkalotic area ATP was decreased to mild to severe degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreased ATP region in the acidotic area showed increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> content, whereas in the alkalotic area <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> was diffusely decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From these results, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo> may be induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> due to plasma exudation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decrease of ATP and increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> in the acidotic area may demonstrate the disturbance of oxidative phosphorylation under anaerobic glycolysis, and the decrease of ATP and decrease of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> in the alkalotic area may demonstrate impairment of glycolysis mainly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
