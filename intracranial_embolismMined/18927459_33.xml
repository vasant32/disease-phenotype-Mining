<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But its widespread application remains limited by narrow treatment time windows and the related risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we ask whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> can prevent tPA-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and extend the reperfusion window in an experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to embolic focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> using homologous clots and treated with: saline at 1 hour; early tPA at 1 hour, delayed tPA at 6 hours; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> at 4 hours; combined <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> at 4 hours plus tPA at 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes and hemorrhagic transformation were quantified at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gelatin zymography was used to measure blood levels of circulating matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early 1-hour thrombolysis restored perfusion and reduced infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late 6-hour tPA did not decrease infarction but instead worsened hemorrhagic conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combining <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> with delayed 6-hour tPA decreased plasma MMP-9 levels, reduced infarction, and ameliorated brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood levels of MMP-9 were also significantly correlated with volumes of infarction and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> may extend tPA treatment time windows in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
