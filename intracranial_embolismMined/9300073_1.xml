<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 110 carotid arteries of 55 patients with unilateral or bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> diagnosed with selective angiography, by using Transcranial Doppler to detect high intensity transient signals (HITS) in the middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HITS identified as embolic signals were prevalent (P &lt; 0.05) in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> on the same side as severe (70-99%) stenosis (22 of 51 = 43.1%) compared to moderate (30-69%) stenosis (5 of 37 = 13.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No HITS were observed in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> on the same side as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control carotid arteries (n = 17) [occluded arteries (n = 5) were not considered] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HITS were more prevalent (P &lt; 0.05) in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> on the same side as ulcerated plaques (14 of 23 = 60.9%) compared to non-ulcerated plaques (13 of 65 = 20%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> moderate stenoses producing HITS presented ulceration of the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ulcerated plaque groups showed a higher mean number of HITS than non-ulcerated plaque groups and no significant difference was noted between moderate and severe stenosis, between superficial or deep ulcerations and between ulcerations with flap or without flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and moderate stenosis with plaque ulceration result in angiographic findings most frequently associated with HITS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to evaluate the clinical significance of this finding </plain></SENT>
