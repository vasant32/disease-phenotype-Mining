<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiac surgery carries a high risk of neurological complications; therefore, these patients would be an appropriate target population for neuroprotective strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated postoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as a potential surrogate marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> and its relationship to neurobiochemical markers of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of a total of 45 consecutive patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, 37 completed preoperative and postoperative MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of the MRI studies, serum S100beta and neuron-specific enolase concentrations were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preexisting T2 and postoperative DWI lesion volumes were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a blinded neurological examination before and after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: New perioperative DWI lesions were present in 14 patients (38%), of whom only 3 developed focal neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen small lesions were found in the white matter or vascular border zones in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 patients with territorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The appearance of new DWI lesions correlated with age, pre-existing T2 lesion volume, and postoperative S100beta concentrations on days 2 to 4 after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a forward stepwise canonical discrimination model, only T2 lesion volume was selected as a relevant variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postoperative DWI lesions in aortic valve replacement is high, and a suitable marker for neuroprotective trials would be a reduction in the number of such lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The volume of preexisting T2 lesions is related to the development of perioperative DWI lesions </plain></SENT>
