<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This explains the large demand for echocardiography and Holter monitoring in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> of cardiac origin, the simplification of the diagnostic approach by non-invasive investigations and the precision of ultrasound techniques explains the tendency towards the indiscriminate generalisation of this attitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the large number of potential patients for investigation, the limited facilities of investigation and the incertitude over the responsibility of certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> with respect to the context and age, are arguments in favour of a more selective investigative approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The keystone of diagnosis is careful history taking and clinical examination with interpretation of the ECG and chest X-ray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three clinical situations may then be identified: 1) A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> known to be highly embolic is diagnosed from the outset (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo>, valve prosthesis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic work-up is no longer etiological: echocardiography may show intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> or a valvular vegetation, reinforcing the causal relationship, but the complementary investigations are mainly useful for evaluation the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> and for deciding on curative or preventive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2) A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> is diagnosed but its responsibility is doubtful due to its high prevalence and low embolic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the case of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, mitral annular calcification, calcific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> and VVI pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complementary investigations are not discriminative for the etiological diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
