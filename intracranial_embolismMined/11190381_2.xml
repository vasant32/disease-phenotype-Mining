<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>Air embolisms</z:mpath> resulting from residual catheter tracts in general patients and in single lung transplant patients have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The generally accepted mechanism of this complication is failure of a spontaneous collapse or thrombotic obliteration of a well-formed catheter tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It may be related to the duration of catheter insertion, the patient's nutritional status, the diameter of the indwelling catheter, the upright position of the patient, deep inspiration or coughing, and improper wound dressing and catheter removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular collapse, pulmonary or neurologic sequelae, and even <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, are commonly noted in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report on cerebral air embolization as a complication with the removal with a central venous catheter in a patient with bullous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A high degree of suspicion and a prompt diagnosis are required for successful application of established therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simple prophylactic procedures and constant awareness of the unusual mechanism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> remain the best treatment </plain></SENT>
