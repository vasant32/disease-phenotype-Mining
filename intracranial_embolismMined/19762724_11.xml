<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1319200" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Postoperative cognitive dysfunction</z:e> (POCD) can be a debilitating complication after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are believed to be an important etiologic factor of POCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether avoidance of CPB with "off-pump" surgery reduces the number of cerebral microemboli and the incidence of POCD after CABG surgery in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred twenty-seven patients were enrolled in this prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine patients underwent CABG surgery with CPB and 168 underwent off-pump surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli were measured continuously with bilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A neuropsychological test battery that included seven tests with nine subscales was administered at baseline, as well as at 1 wk and 3 mo after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>POCD was defined using the international study of POCD1 definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median total number of cerebral microemboli for the case was 430 (range: 155-2088) in patients undergoing surgery with CPB and 2 (0-66) in the off-pump patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the incidence of POCD between the patients having surgery with or without CPB either at 1 wk (55.2% or 32 of 58 patients [95% confidence interval: 41.5%-68.3%] vs 47.0% or 78 of 166 patients [39.2%-54.9%], P = 0.283) or 3 mo (6.4% or 3 of 47 patients [1.3%-17.5%] vs 13.1% or 16 of 122 of patients [7.7%-20.4%], P = 0.214) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing age and shorter duration of postoperative hospital stay were independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> at 1 wk after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increasing age and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> 3 mo after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CPB or cerebral microemboli were not significantly related to the occurrence of POCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese population, avoidance of CPB during CABG surgery significantly decreased the number of cerebral microemboli, but it did not decrease the incidence of POCD at either 1 wk or 3 mo after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neither CPB nor cerebral microemboli was independently associated with the risk of POCD </plain></SENT>
