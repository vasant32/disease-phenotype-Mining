<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> is a serious complication of heart valve replacement, and management is often difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, thrombolytic therapy has been used as the primary technique by some investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-four consecutive patients presenting with 75 instances of prosthetic heart valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (41 mitral, 33 aortic, one tricuspid) were treated with fibrinolytic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Obstructed prosthetic valves comprised 39 tilting disc and 36 bileaflet valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time interval between valve replacement and obstruction ranged from 15 days to 192 months (mean, 38 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolytic agents used were streptokinase (42 patients), urokinase (27 patients), or recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (six patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediate results of fibrinolytic treatment were 1) full success after one or several consecutive fibrinolytic regimens in 55 cases (73%), 2) incomplete improvement in two cases, and 3) failure in 18 cases, leading to an emergency surgery in nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients died (four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrests</z:hpo>, one <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one severe hemorrhagic complication was observed, but 11 cases of embolism occurred during fibrinolytic treatment (14.6%) (four major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The immediate efficacy was better for thrombosed aortic prosthesis than with the mitral prosthesis (85% versus 63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fibrinolytic treatment appears to be an attractive nonsurgical alternative for prosthetic heart valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but because of the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, its use should be reserved for tricuspid valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients with mitral or aortic valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of a fibrinolytic agent in cases of small, nonobstructive paravalvular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> demonstrated with transesophageal echocardiography needs further studies </plain></SENT>
