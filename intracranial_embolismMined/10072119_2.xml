<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C resistance (APC-R) was measured by Dahlback's method and the modified method using factor V-deficient plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activities of antithrombin (AT) III, protein C and S were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibody was estimated by ELISA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> by kaolin clotting tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APC-R was the most common defect (21.62%) followed by AT III deficiency and presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (5.6% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter two were present together in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is thus concluded that APC-R is the most common defect underlying idiopathic nonembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262200" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular infarction</z:e> in young individuals </plain></SENT>
