<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the applied surgical tactics the patients were retrospectively divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first included 8 patients where surgical reconstruction of the ascending aorta was implemented in the standard way, the second group comprised 9 patients where the method of deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three operated patients died, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from the group with deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was twice multiorgan failure and once haemorrhage in a female patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors discuss the advantages and some pitfalls of surgery in deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> and maintain that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> are most serious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the conclusion they draw attention to some possible ways how to improve hitherto achieved results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They include e.g. reduction of the time interval between the development of symptoms of dissection and surgery, careful checking of the cooling and heating when using deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, as well as better prevention of cerebral embolic attacks </plain></SENT>
