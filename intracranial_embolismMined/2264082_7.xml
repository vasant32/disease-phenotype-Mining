<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases, thrombotic occlusion was caused by rupture of the fibrous lining over the gruel of atheroma at the origin of the internal carotid artery showing tight stenosis of the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- SD shorter diameter of the lumen at the site of occlusion was 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that an internal carotid artery with tight stenosis of the lumen by atheroma containing gruel harbors a risk of thrombotic occlusion, which may give rise to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by artery-to-artery embolism or by reduced cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
