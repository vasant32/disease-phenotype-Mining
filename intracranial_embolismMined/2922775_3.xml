<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of postembolic treatment with flunarizine and streptokinase on hemispheric cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2), oxygen extraction ratio (OER), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen-15</z:chebi> technique) 24 hours after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied five groups of experimental dogs and compared them with a control group of nonembolized dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group I received no treatment, Group II was treated locally with 500,000 IU streptokinase starting 30 minutes after the insult, Group III received streptokinase locally 30 minutes after the insult and 0.1 mg/kg i.v. flunarizine immediately after the insult and 2 hours later, Group IV received flunarizine as Group III, and Group V was orally pretreated with 0.5 mg/kg/day flunarizine during 2 weeks preceding embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the contralateral hemisphere, in the embolized hemisphere a significant reduction of CMRO2 (-25% to -40%) and CBF in normocapnia (-35%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> (-50%) was observed in Groups I, II, and V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Groups III and IV, CMRO2, OER, and CBF of the embolized hemisphere were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range during normocapnia and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>; the extent of the ischemic lesions was markedly less than in the other groups of experimental dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that flunarizine treatment after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> had a favorable influence on brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> preventive flunarizine treatment failed to have a beneficial effect </plain></SENT>
