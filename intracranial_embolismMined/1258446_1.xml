<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Toxico-allergic reactions and dynamic disturbances of the cerebral circulation developed more often in contrasting 2 or more brachycephalic vessels, with a two-fold introduction of the contrast medium into one and the same vascular basin and also in cases of a quick injection of a relatively large amount of the compound into the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> of the cerebral vessels was, apparently, caused by a small clot of blood which occluded an atherosclerotically altered internal carotid artery at the site of its bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations of the said complications and a number of preventive and curative measures in case of cerebral complications arising during cervical angiography are considered in detail </plain></SENT>
