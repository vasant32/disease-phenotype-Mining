<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We occluded the middle cerebral arteries of 137 rabbits with radiolabeled blood clots and administered tissue plasminogen activator (n = 49), streptokinase (n = 40), or saline (n = 48) at various times after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the rate of thrombolysis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both drugs were very effective in producing thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with saline, streptokinase caused a significant increase in the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05), but tissue plasminogen activator did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> should be safer with tissue plasminogen activator than with streptokinase </plain></SENT>
