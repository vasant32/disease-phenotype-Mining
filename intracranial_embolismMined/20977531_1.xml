<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a physiological ultrasound test with established safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although imaging devices may be used to depict intracranial flow superimposed on structural visualization, the end-result provided by imaging duplex or nonimaging TCD is sampling physiological flow variables through the spectral waveform assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF RESULTS: Clinical indications considered by this multidisciplinary panel of experts as established are: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> (RLS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and periprocedural or surgical monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following TCD-procedures are performed in routine in- and outpatient clinical practice: complete or partial TCD-examination to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, stenosed, or occluded intracranial vessels, collaterals to locate an arterial obstruction and refine carotid-duplex or noninvasive angiographic findings; vasomotor reactivity testing to identify high-risk patients for first-ever or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; emboli detection to detect, localize, and quantify cerebral embolization in real time; RLS-detection in patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> or those considered for shunt closure; monitoring of thrombolysis to facilitate recanalization and detect reocclusion; monitoring of endovascular stenting, carotid endarterectomy, and cardiac surgery to detect perioperative embolism, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, hypo- and hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: By defining the scope of practice, these standards will assist referring and reporting physicians and third parties involved in the process of requesting, evaluating, and acting upon TCD results </plain></SENT>
