<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(2) Nine studies have examined the efficacy of cerebral protection devices, by comparing the incidence of procedure related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> to that of CAS without protection, and to surgical endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
