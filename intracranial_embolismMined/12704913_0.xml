<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One reason may be the increase of interventional treatment (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For that we investigated the value of ultrasound duplex scanning to predict preoperatively the vascular surface and plaque structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>368 patients operated on obstructing stenosis of the carotid artery could be enrolled in this investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients duplex ultrasound scanning was performed preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 127 patient an analysis of TC-Doppler curve was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During some operations (eversion endarteriectomie) we performed experimental stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The evaluation was performed with statistical methods </plain></SENT>
