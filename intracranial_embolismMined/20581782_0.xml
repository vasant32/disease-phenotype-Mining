<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The accidental migration of air from the venous circulation into the systemic arterial circulation is called paradoxical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a potential disastrous complication after diagnostic and surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arthrography has been a useful technique in joint imaging for the past decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paradoxical cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is a very rare complication, only a few cases have been reported after arthrography of the hip in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002448'>progressive encephalopathy</z:hpo> after computer tomography (CT) arthrography of the ankle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We describe a 64-year-old male who underwent CT-arthrography of the left ankle, after the intra-articular injection of 20 ml of air he experienced progressive neurologic and hemodynamic deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A brain CT showed a small amount of air in a right frontal sulcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) was initiated after a delay of 16 hours and resulted in a complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the presence of a right-left shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case of paradoxical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> with severe neurological manifestations after arthrography of the ankle, emphasizes that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> should be considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with neurologic and/or hemodynamic deterioration after the injection of intra articular air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore a delay of more then 6 hours is no reason to withhold HBO in these patients </plain></SENT>
