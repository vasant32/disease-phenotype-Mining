<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with &gt; or = 60% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> with symptoms in the preceding 2 months were prospectively considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were identified using current criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed-up until endarterectomy or angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 50 patients, at a median of 7 days from their last symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients showed <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (40.0%); median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> rate was 4/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 19 days 7 patients had recurrences (transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> = 2; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>=4; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>=1); 6 of them had shown <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between recurrences and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was significant (P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> may identify patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> who are likely to suffer an ischemic recurrence before endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
