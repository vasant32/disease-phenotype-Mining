<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early CT signs in the deep middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territories have been reported to be seen at the initial period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to investigate the incidence of parenchymal hypodensity within 3 hours after ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> among patients with angiographically proved embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and to assess the correlation of subtle hypodensity in the deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories with involvement of the lenticulostriate arteries in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty CT images obtained within 3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were retrospectively reviewed by three neurosurgeons who were aware of clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early CT signs in the deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories were divided into three grades according to their anatomic location: grade I, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basal ganglia with hypodensity localized to the insula; grade II, partial obscuration of the posterolateral part of the putamen; and grade III, hypodensity of the entire lentiform nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A grade I CT sign was considered to be a negative finding for lenticulostriate artery involvement, whereas grade II and III CT signs were considered to be positive findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Site of occlusion and involvement of the lenticulostriate arteries were confirmed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-eight (76%) of 50 patients had early CT signs in the deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of a grade I CT sign indicating absence of lenticulostriate artery involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were 65% and 87%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, sensitivity and specificity of grade II and grade III CT signs for presence of lenticulostriate artery involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were 77% and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade II CT signs resulted from various sites of occlusion, whereas grade III was unequivocally predictive of proximal occlusion to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the lenticulostriate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Involvement of the lenticulostriate arteries may be presumed by precise evaluation of subtle, CT-revealed hypodensity in the deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories, even within 3 hours of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
