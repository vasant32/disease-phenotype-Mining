<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A young patient, who experienced a cerebral embolic event 30 days after transvenous pacemaker lead placement, is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This patient had previously been paced with an epicardial lead without evidence of right to left intracardiac shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, hemodynamic evaluation post-embolism demonstrated a marked temporal disparity of the pulmonary and systemic ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This phasic divergence resulted in a brief reversal of right and left ventricular pressure ratios, and a paradoxic intracardiac shunt at a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The potential for similar events in the presence of any defect of the atrial or ventricular septum mandates caution in the use of transvenous pacemaker leads in such patients </plain></SENT>
