<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 62-year-old Japanese man presented left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and left visuospatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e> following a right hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His CTs and MRIs of the brain revealed a large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> of the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A month after the cerebrovascular event, his <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the left lower limb almost recovered fully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, his upper limb motor function was still disabled; in particular, his ability of finger flexion in the left hand was almost lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, vestibular stimulation using either a cold caloric stimulation to the left ear or a warm caloric stimulation to the right ear was performed, and the effect on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e> symptoms were assessed by a line bisection task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After vestibular stimulation, not only his <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e> symptoms but also his motor functions of left upper limb transiently improved; he became able to make a fist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The improvement of his <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e> symptoms was obtained by vestibular stimulation using either a cold or a warm caloric stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the effect on the motor function was obtained only by the cold caloric stimulation applied to the left ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the effect of the vestibular stimulation, we postulates that the impairment of the motor function in the present patient is not only a <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> caused by the pyramidal tract lesion but also symptoms related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
