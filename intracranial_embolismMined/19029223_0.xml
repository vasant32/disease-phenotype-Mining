<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight consecutive patients (mean age, 73.1 years; 3 men and 5 women; 10 malignant lesions; mean lesion size, 24.8 mm) who underwent RFA of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024121" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung tumours</z:e> using internally cooled single electrodes were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the RFA procedure, the right internal carotid artery was continuously monitored by duplex ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-intensity transient signals (HITS) that occurred in the Doppler blood flow waveform were taken to indicate microbubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>21 RFA applications were performed for the 10 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HITS were observed in 19 of 21 RFA applications; the mean frequency in a single application was 10+/-13.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A statistical correlation was seen between the duration of energy deposition and the number of HITS, and between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size and the number of HITS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microbubbles were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the late phase of the first session of RFA </plain></SENT>
