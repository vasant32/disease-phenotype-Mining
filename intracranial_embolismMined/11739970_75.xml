<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression was significantly increased and related to blood-brain barrier disruption, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation, and hemorrhagic transformation (HT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MMP inhibitors reduce HT after embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in tissue-type plasminogen activator-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the relationship between MMPs and HT after human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial MMP-2 and MMP-9 determinations were performed by means of ELISA in 39 cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic events were classified according to clinical and CT criteria (hemorrhagic infarction [HI] and parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29941">[PH]</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HT was evaluated on CT at 48 hours (early HT) and again between day 5 and 7 (late HT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HT was present in 41% of the patients (43.75% early HI, 25% early PH and 31.25% late HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 values were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range and were unrelated to HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of MMP-9 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range &lt;97 ng/mL) was found among patients with and without HT (159.3+/-82 versus 143.9+/-112.6 ng/mL; P=0.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to HT subtypes, the highest baseline MMP-9 levels corresponded to patients with late HI (240.4+/-111.2 versus 102.5+/-76.7 ng/mL for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Baseline MMP-9 was the only variable associated with late HI in the multiple logistic regression model (OR 9; CI 1.46, 55.24; P=0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Peak of MMP-9 at the 24-hour time point (250.6 ng/mL) was found before appearance of PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MMPs are involved in some subtypes of HT after human cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Baseline MMP-9 level predicts late HI and a 24-hour peak precedes early PH </plain></SENT>
