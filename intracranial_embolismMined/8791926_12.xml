<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To demonstrate the neuroradiologic findings in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A review of hospital records for a 10-year period revealed 50 patients with a discharge diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had undergone neuroimaging, and abnormal findings were found in 5 cases; these were the subjects of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 patients had abnormal findings on CT scans, 3 had abnormal findings on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, and 1 had an abnormal finding on a cerebral angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had cerebral cortical or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarctions</z:e>, and 1 also had small infarctions within the brain stem and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had cerebral angiographic findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> was considered probable or possible in 3 other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients had echocardiographic evidence of concentric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and a hypocontractile left ventricle resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiogenic embolism was considered the likely cause in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Small peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e>, consistent with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> involving medium-sized and small arteries, were the most common finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, cardiogenic embolism should also be considered as a possible cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e> who have left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
