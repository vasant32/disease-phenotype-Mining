<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine nationally representative estimates of the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> during pregnancy and the puerperium, and to identify potential risk factors for these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: National Hospital Discharge Survey data were analyzed for the period 1979 to 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nationally representative estimates of risk were calculated by age, race, presence of pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, census region, hospital ownership, and number of hospital beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models were developed using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were an estimated 8,918 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 5,723 cases of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> during pregnancy and the puerperium in the United States among 50,264,631 deliveries, giving risks of 17.7 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 11.4 cases of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> per 100,000 deliveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate models, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was associated strongly with pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, larger hospital size, and proprietary hospital ownership, and inversely associated with living in the South </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was associated with maternal age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> are relatively common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complications of pregnancy</z:e> and the puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, rates for these conditions are about 50% greater for the entire period of pregnancy and the puerperium than for the immediate peripartum period </plain></SENT>
