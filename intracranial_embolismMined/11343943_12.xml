<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during coronary bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of prospectively gathered data on 6682 consecutive coronary bypass patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing simultaneous procedures, including carotid endarterectomy, were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who suffered a perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were determined with stepwise logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 1.5% (n=98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients had significantly increased intensive care unit and hospital length of stays, as well as increased mortality when compared to patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were (in decreasing order of magnitude): age &gt;70 years, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chart review revealed that the probable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was macroemboli, likely from ascending aorta <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, in 37% of patients and unknown in 38% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography (CT) scans were obtained in 79 patients (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lesions detected by CT were consistent with a macroembolic etiology: nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions were ischemic in nature and located in the distribution of major cerebral arteries, particularly the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is a devastating complication of coronary bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our multivariable risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, chart review, and CT findings <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suggest that macroemboli, presumably from the ascending aorta, are the predominant cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during coronary bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future studies should be directed at minimizing the risk of embolization during cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
