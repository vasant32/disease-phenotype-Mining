<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Deep venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (DVT) is an important health issue in the hospitalized geriatric population that leads to <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> of stay, morbidity, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are usually not placed on prophylactic therapy because of the risk of hemorrhagic extension of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of DVTs in hospitalized patients with hemorrhagic vs. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of data obtained from the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission data base for 1999 to determine the prevalence of DVTs in both hemorrhagic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> patients hospitalized acutely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was performed to evaluate possible risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1926 patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 15599 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women in general had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> than men did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older patients were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> as evidenced by the mean ages of 66 and 71 yr for hemorrhagic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic strokes</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 37 patients (1.9%) with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had DVTs, whereas 74 patients (0.5%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic strokes</z:hpo> had DVTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was an independent risk factor for DVT (odds ratio, 2.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-4.55; P = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DVT prevalence and risk was higher among patients with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in comparison with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
