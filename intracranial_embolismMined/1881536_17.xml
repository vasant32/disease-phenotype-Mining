<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to verify the incidence and reliability of the HMCAS and its possible correlation with early CT findings and with the extent of late brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 36 patients presenting with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, by means of CT and angiography performed respectively within 4 and 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up CT scans were then obtained after one week and three months from the ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HMCAS was present in 50% of our patients and in this group it always correlated positively with the angiographic finding of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same group presented a high incidence of early CT hypodensity (88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally the presence of HMCAS might be considered a negative prognostic sign for the development of extensive brain damage </plain></SENT>
