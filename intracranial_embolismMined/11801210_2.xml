<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This can lead to thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We report two cases where pacemaker catheters placed unintentionally in the left ventricle via a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The malpositioned pacemaker catheters were demonstrated by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both patients, no further embolic events have occurred after treatment, which in one case consisted of pacemaker catheter removal and in the other case, anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Echocardiography can be useful to confirm inadvertent left ventricular pacemaker placement in patients with pacemakers who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
