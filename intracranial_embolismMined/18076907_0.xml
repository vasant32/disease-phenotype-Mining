<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are data in the literature indicating that the number of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) is directly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We thus hypothesized that the amount of artificially induced microembolic signals monitored by contrast transcranial Doppler (cTCD) would be greater in younger patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (when cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> related to the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> are frequent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The final analysis included 109 patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, as detected by Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE), and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, as measured by cTCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients (aged 19-45 years) were defined as the "younger" group, and the other 72 patients (aged 46-77 years) were defined as the "older" group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six patients (78.9%) suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including 28 in the younger group and 58 in the older group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pattern of microembolization was defined as "countable" when the observers were able to calculate the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of a "shower" of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> on TCD examination, the pattern of monitoring was defined as "non-countable." RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">Ischemic heart disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> were found to be significantly more frequent in the group of older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients (62.2%) in the younger group had cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (no risk factors found), as compared to 26 patients (36.1%) in the older group (p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 23 patients with a non-countable pattern of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the older group, as compared with 5 such patients in the younger group (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference found in the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> between the groups in those patients with a countable pattern of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (13.3+/-11.8 in the younger group vs. 13.7+/-11.7 in the older group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients above 45 years of age, <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFOs</z:mp> producing a large amount of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> on TCD examination are frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is no correlation between a large amount of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in young patients </plain></SENT>
