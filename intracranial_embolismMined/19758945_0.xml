<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New hyperintense lesions on diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DWI) were used to compare different cerebral protection devices.Methods and results: Patients (n=33) with high-grade symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were treated with CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two different methods of cerebral embolic protection were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 23 patients, a filter device was placed in the distal internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients a protection system based on the reversed-flow principle was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DWI was performed before and after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number and volume of new hyperintense lesions in the ipsilateral hemisphere were assessed.No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three new hyperintense lesions in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere were recorded on the post-treatment DWI-series after stent placement in 12 of the 33 procedures (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 8 of the 23 procedures (35%) performed with a filter device and in 4 of the 10 procedures (40%) performed with the reversed-flow device new hyperintense lesions were revealed (13 and 10, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the number of lesions and lesion load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The volume per lesion was significantly smaller in the patient group treated with reversed-flow device in comparison to the patient group treated with a filter device (median 0,048 mm3 and 0,013 mm3, respectively; p=0.03).Conclusion: This non-randomised study revealed no difference in new subclinical ischaemic lesions in the ipsilateral hemisphere between procedures performed with filter devices and procedures performed with embolic protection using the reversed-flow principle </plain></SENT>
