<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Boston Area Anticoagulation Trial for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> (BAATAF) demonstrated that low-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> anticoagulation can, with safety, sharply reduce the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was presumably related to a decrease in clot formation in the cardiac atria and subsequent embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To assess the effect of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy on in vivo clotting in patients in the BAATAF, we measured the plasma level of prothrombin activation fragment F1+2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One sample was obtained from 125 patients from the BAATAF; 62 were taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and 63 were not taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group had a 71% lower mean F1+2 level than the control group (mean F1+2 of 1.57 nmol/L in the control group compared with a mean of 0.46 nmol/L in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>F1+2 levels were higher in older subjects but were consistently lower in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two percent of patients in the control group were taking <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> aspirin therapy at the time their F1+2 level was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control patients taking aspirin had F1+2 levels very similar to control patients not taking aspirin (mean of 1.52 nmol/L for control patients on aspirin compared with 1.64 nmol/L for control patients off aspirin; P &gt; .1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that prothrombin activation was significantly suppressed in vivo by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> but not aspirin among patients in the BAATAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings correlate with the marked reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> noted among patients in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment group observed in the BAATAF </plain></SENT>
