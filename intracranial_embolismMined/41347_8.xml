<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In cats <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> of the brain was produced by injecting 0.6 ml blood foam into the innominate artery proximal to the origin of both common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>Air embolism</z:mpath> caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> of the brain, reaching a maximum within 1 min after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resolution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> began a few minutes later and was completed within 15 min in the center and within 30 min in the border zone of the main supplying arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During this phase tissue perfusion was inhomogenous with reduced flow rates in some areas and reactive hyperemia up to 300% in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This resulted in venous <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> and a decrease of arteriovenous oxygen difference to as low as 2 ml/100 ml blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactive hyperemia was accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and an increase in intracranial pressure from 3.6 +/- 1.2 to 12.3 +/- 2.0 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reason for hyperemia was a decrease of cortical pH which fell from 7.33 +/- 0.03 to 7.03 +/- 0.05, and which caused a dilation of pial arteries up to 260% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immediately after embolism, the EEG flattened and oxygen consumption decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After normalization of flow, oxygen consumption returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but EEG only partially recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>Air embolism</z:mpath> had little effect on the water and electrolyte content of the brain, and produced very little damage to the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
