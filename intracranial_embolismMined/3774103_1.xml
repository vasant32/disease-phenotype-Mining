<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial angiogram failed to reveal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and other etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We decided to operate on these patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage because of the generally-known strict correlation between the amount of cisternal high density on CT and the subsequent development of vasospasm and ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 68 year-old female was admitted on Day 1 with neurological deterioration of Grade 3 (H &amp; K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete angiographic study was done, including the basal view and stereotechnique, but failed to reveal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On Day 2 we operated on this patient and discovered a thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the anterior communicating artery (3 X 7 mm in size) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A 51 year-old male suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was transferred to our hospital on Day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Emergency angiography gave no information, but the pattern of cisternal clots on CT was suggested the existence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The next day we performed angiography once more, at that time 2 X 5 mm internal carotid bifurcated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was revealed </plain></SENT>
