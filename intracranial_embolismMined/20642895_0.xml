<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neonates presenting with intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> due to vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAMs) rapidly progress to multisystem organ failure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> if left untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently the only viable treatment option is endovascular embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although intracranial embolization of a neonate is a high-risk procedure, successful treatment can reverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> and prevent neurological complications associated with VGAMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolization via the arterial route is thought to have a better outcome than embolization via the venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, multiple transarterial embolizations in different sessions may well be contraindicated in neonates, because repeat access via the femoral artery, carries a risk of arterial trauma which, in turn, can jeopardize lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With this case study we show that after repeat failure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332335" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial embolization</z:e>, the transcranial placement of an Amplatzer <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> occluder (AGA Medical, Plymouth, USA) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> can effectively reduce intrafistular pressure and venous outflow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also propose a mathematical model that can be used to calculate flow velocity through the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, which, in turn, could be used to aid clinical decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unlike some conventional techniques, the placement of an Amplatzer occluder does not pose the risk of completely obstructing venous drainage and therefore does not increase the risk of venous breakthrough <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose this endovascular technique as a treatment option for high risk neonates in need of emergency embolization of VGAMs, where multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332335" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial embolizations</z:e> failed to control the condition sufficiently </plain></SENT>
