<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between heart valve history and susceptibility artifacts at magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging of the brain in patients with Bj√∂rk-Shiley convexoconcave (BSCC) valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of the brain were obtained in 58 patients with prosthetic heart valves: 20 patients had BSCC valve replacements, and 38 had other types of heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two experienced neuroradiologists determined the presence or absence of susceptibility artifacts in a consensus reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Artifacts were defined as characteristic black spots that were visible on T2*-weighted gradient-echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The statuses of the 20 explanted BSCC valves-specifically, whether they were intact or had an outlet strut fracture (OSF) or a single-leg fracture (SLF)-had been determined earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Number of artifacts seen at brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was correlated with explanted valve status, and differences were analyzed with nonparametric statistical tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly more patients with BSCC valves (17 [85%] of 20 patients) than patients with other types of prosthetic valves (18 [47%] of 38 patients) had susceptibility artifacts at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (P =.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BSCC valve OSFs were associated with a significantly higher number of artifacts than were intact BSCC valves (P =.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship between SLF and number of artifacts was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Susceptibility artifacts at brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging are not restricted to patients with BSCC valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These artifacts can be seen on images obtained in patients with various other types of fractured and intact prosthetic heart valves </plain></SENT>
