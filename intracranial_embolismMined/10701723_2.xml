<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> completely resolves in a few days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes a patient suffering an unusual course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100704'>cortical blindness</z:hpo> following aortography resulting in permanent, partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> was the consequence of bilateral occipital embolisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case emphasizes that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100704'>cortical blindness</z:hpo> associated with angiography does not always have a favorable outcome, since it might be, in rare cases, due to isolated occipital embolisms, which initially produce a clinical picture identical to that of the neurotoxic effect of contrast agents </plain></SENT>
