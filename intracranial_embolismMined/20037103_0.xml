<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic trauma generates emboli and hence harbors the potential for neurocognitive injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The single aortic clamp strategy of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) aims at reducing aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that this strategy will lead to a reduction in the number microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) evaluated by transcranial Doppler (TCD), a surrogate measure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This pilot study was based on a prospective analysis of 22 patients in whom CABG was performed either with a single aortic clamp (SC group) or with a conventional multiple aortic side-clamp technique (MC group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2 groups did not differ with respect to mean age (60 + or - 6 years versus 65 + or - 8 years, not statistically significant [NS]) or EuroSCORE (2.1 + or - 1.5 versus 2.9 + or - 2, P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurocognitive evaluation was based on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The preoperative MMSE values for the SC and MC groups were similar (29.5 + or - 0.5 and 29.2 + or - 1, respectively; P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total number of solid-particle embolization signals secondary to aortic manipulation was lower in the SC group than in the MC group (72 + or - 28 versus 127 + or - 69, P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitive performance was moderately reduced in both groups compared with preoperative values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This reduction was more pronounced in the MC group than in the SC group (22.2 + or - 4.1 versus 25.3 + or - 1.6, P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient in the MC group had a reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The single-clamp CABG strategy led to a reduction in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, indicating a less pronounced embolic burden than with the conventional side-clamp CABG strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This strategy translated into a better performance in postoperative neurocognitive testing in the SC group of patients </plain></SENT>
