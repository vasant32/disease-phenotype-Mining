<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We introduce a technique that enables the use of catheter angiography during image-guided surgery for the resection of previously embolized <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used models to test the possibility of matching specific anatomic points 1:1 and the accuracy of merging catheter-based 3-dimensional angiography with standard computed tomographic angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After obtaining excellent accuracy matching the 2 modalities, we merged both studies into the image-guidance platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After embolizing a patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> with Onyx, we successfully used the merged study to navigate during surgical resection of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No complications resulted from this technique, which increases contrast by only 15 cm and radiation exposure by 4 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Catheter-based angiography can be used during image guidance to reduce the artifact from metal particles after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excellent accuracy was obtained in merging 3-dimensional angiography with computed tomographic angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate catheter-based 3-dimensional angiography as a single method for navigation during neurovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
