<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study in patients with 50%-99% (ECST) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Carotid plaque ultrasonic images (n=54, 26 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and 28 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) obtained during carotid ultrasound were normalised and standardised for resolution and subsequently assessed visually for the presence of discrete echogenic or juxtaluminal echolucent components and overall echogenicity (plaque type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using computer software, 51 histogram/textural features of the plaque outlines were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis was subsequently applied to eliminate redundant variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small cortical, large cortical and discrete subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on CT-brain scan were considered as being embolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five cases (46%) had embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On logistic regression, grey-scale median (GSM), a measure of echolucency, spatial grey level dependence matrices (SGLDM) correlation and SGLDM information measure of correlation-1, measures of homogeneity were significant (p&lt;0.05), but not grey level runlength statistics (RUNL) Run Percentage (RP), stenosis severity, type of symptoms or echolucent juxtaluminal components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using ROC curves methodology, SGLDM information measure of correlation-1 improved the value of GSM in distinguishing embolic from non-embolic CT-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Computerised texture analysis of ultrasonic images of symptomatic carotid plaques can identify those that are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, improving the results achieved by GSM alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This methodology could be applied to prospective natural history studies of symptomatic patients not operated on or randomised trials of patients undergoing carotid angioplasty and stenting in order to identify high-risk subgroups for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
