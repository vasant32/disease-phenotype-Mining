<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of immunoreactive ANP and thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) were measured in five age-matched groups including: 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (group 1), 26 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (group 2), 27 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> without previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (group 3), 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (group 4), and 27 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma ANP levels were higher in group 1, regardless of the stage, than those estimated at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage in group 4 and in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no stage-related differences between groups 1, 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of ANP in group 2, a high risk group of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, were higher than in group 3, a low risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between plasma levels of ANP and mean blood pressure, pulse rate or plasma levels of TAT in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the determination of plasma ANP concentration is useful to distinguish a high risk patient from a low risk patient and also a cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient from a lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
