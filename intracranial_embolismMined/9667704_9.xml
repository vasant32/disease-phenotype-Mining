<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis greater than 70 per cent in association with a contralateral ICA occlusion may have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> following carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such patients might benefit from the theoretically shorter ischaemic time offered by carotid angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients who underwent carotid angioplasty and stenting were monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy, continuous jugular venous oximetry and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to detect both haemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> occurred in four of the nine patients once the stenosis had been crossed by the guidewire (spectroscopy and oximetry) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inflation of the angioplasty balloon resulted in a brief period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and showers of emboli in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (ultrasonography) and this persisted for more than 3 min after balloon deflation in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had a major disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to ICA <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Angioplasty and stenting in these high-risk patients may not confer any advantage over conventional surgery in terms of both haemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and embolization </plain></SENT>
