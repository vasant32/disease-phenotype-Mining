<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were abnormal in 24 of 36 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of these had an abnormality of the internal carotid artery in the neck; one-third had occlusion of the middle and/or anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant rise of serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">pre-beta lipoproteins</z:chebi>, platelet adhesiveness and aggregation, and a decrease in fibrinolytic activity were noticed in these patients as compared to age and sex matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient did not show any intercorrelation between the platelet adhesiveness and raised <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These factors could be responsible for the atheroma resulting in large vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
