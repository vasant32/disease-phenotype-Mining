<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Neurocognitive deficits occur frequently in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and may be caused, in part, by ischemic cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> has been proposed as a neuroprotective strategy to reduce ischemic injury in animal studies, in postcardiac arrest, and during cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the effects of sustained mild intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, without rewarming, on neurocognitive function after coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (aged &gt;/= 60 years) undergoing non-urgent coronary surgery were randomized to an intraoperative nasopharyngeal temperature of 34 degrees C (hypothermic; n = 133) or 37 degrees C (normothermic; n = 134), maintained using water-circulating thermal control pads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No active rewarming was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler was used intraoperatively to monitor middle cerebral artery emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychometric testing, consisting of a battery of 16 tests, was performed by blinded observers preoperatively, before discharge, and at 3 months, and tests were divided into 4 cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A deficit was prospectively defined as a 1 standard deviation decrease in individual scores from baseline in 1 or more domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> was similar between the control and the treated groups (188 [115-331] vs 182 [100-305], P = .71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At discharge, neurocognitive deficits were present in 45% of control patients and in 49% of treated patients (P = .49) and at 3 months decreased to 8% in control patients and 4% in treated patients (P = .28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the total number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and the occurrence of neurocognitive deficits (r = -0.01; P = .88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hypothermic patients demonstrated trends toward reduced intensive care unit stay (1.4 +/- 1.0 days vs 1.2 +/- 0.7 days, P = .06) and increased chest tube output (655 +/- 327 mL/24 h vs 584 +/- 325 mL/24 h, P = .09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mild intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> has no major adverse effects but does not decrease the incidence of neurocognitive deficits in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the absence of rewarming and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, sustained mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> does not improve cognitive outcome </plain></SENT>
