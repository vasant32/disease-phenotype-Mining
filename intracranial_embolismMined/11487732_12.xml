<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-, perfusion-, and postcontrast T1-weighted MRI were performed between 4 and 9 hours and at 24 hours after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with either rt-PA or saline was started 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A spectrophotometric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> assay quantified <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, relative cerebral blood flow index (rCBFi) and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) in the ischemic territory were 30% +/- 23% and 60% +/- 5% (of contralateral), respectively, which increased to 45% +/- 39% and 68% +/- 4% 2 hours after rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours, rCBFi and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> were 27% +/- 27% and 59 +/- 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> volume after 24 hours was significantly greater in rt-PA-treated animals than in controls (8.7 +/- 3.7 microL vs. 5.1 +/- 2.4 microL, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before rt-PA administration, clear postcontrast T1-weighted signal intensity enhancement was evident in areas of subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These areas had lower rCBFi levels than regions without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (23% +/- 22% vs. 36% +/- 29%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, late thrombolytic therapy does not necessarily lead to successful reperfusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful for quantifying effects of thrombolytic therapy and predicting risks of hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
