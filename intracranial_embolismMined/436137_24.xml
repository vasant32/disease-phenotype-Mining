<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate was 0.14% (brachial, 0.12%; femoral, 0.16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the brachial group, the mortality rate was three times as high for non-heparinized as for heparinized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In institutions performing fewer than 100 examinations per year, the combined incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was five times higher than in institutions performing more than 400 examinations per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left main coronary artery or three-vessel disease was present in most patients who died of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to a previous survey of 1970--71, there was a profound decrease in significant complications (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>) and entry site complications such as <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reduction in mortality with the femoral technique since 1971 was not accounted for by heparinization and may reflect increasing experience with the method and shorter angiographic times </plain></SENT>
