<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had percutaneous femoral artery catheterization using #8F catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major complications included two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> and four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery on the femoral artery was required in 2 patients (1 occlusion and 1 pseudoaneurysm), 7 patients developed unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> without subsequent infarction, and 4 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications requiring admission were found in 39 patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have found outpatient catheterization to be a safe procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications requiring admission occurred in 3.9% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common reason for admission was to perform urgent bypass surgery in patients with main left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> in excess of 50% </plain></SENT>
