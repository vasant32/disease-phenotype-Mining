<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Embolic protection devices (EPDs) are used to provide protection against brain embolization during carotid artery stenting (CAS) to treat carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, but the optimal type of EPD has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distally positioned filters are commonly used but do not provide protection during crossing of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective, multicenter study investigated a proximally placed device (GORE Flow Reversal System) that reverses blood flow in the internal carotid artery during CAS, thereby directing emboli away from the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Outcomes in 122 patients (28% symptomatic), who underwent CAS using the flow reversal system were assessed (intention-to-treat analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was a major adverse event (MAE; defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) within 30 days of CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoint was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) or nonstroke-related neurologic event within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The flow reversal system could not be used in one patient because of severe vessel tortuosity and in two patients (1.6%) because of intolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 30-day MAE rate and the secondary endpoint rate were each 1.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient in the series died or had an MI within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient who was symptomatic before CAS had an MAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One symptomatic and one asymptomatic patient had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of the GORE Flow Reversal System during CAS had a high rate of technical success and low 30-day rates of adverse neurologic and cardiac events </plain></SENT>
