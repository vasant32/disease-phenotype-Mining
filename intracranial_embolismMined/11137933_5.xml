<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study identified in patients with carotid plaques the associations of emboli detected by means of transcranial Doppler (TCD) with cerebrovascular symptoms, brain computed tomography (CT) infarction patterns, and the attributes of plaques (echodensity, degree of stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty carotid plaques (in 59 patients), producing 50% to 99% stenosis, were imaged on duplex scanning and analyzed echomorphologically in a computer with the gray scale median (GSM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The GSM facilitated the quantitative distinction of dark (low GSM) from bright (high GSM) plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stenosis was assessed with duplex scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emboli were counted on TCD in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery for half an hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain CT infarction patterns (pattern A: discrete subcortical and cortical; pattern B: hemodynamic, diffuse white matter lesions, basal ganglia infarctions, lacunes) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT and cerebrovascular symptoms on the ipsilateral hemisphere were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Emboli were more frequent in symptomatic (median count, 3) than asymptomatic (median count, 0) hemispheres (Mann-Whitney U test, P =.031) and in hemispheres with pattern A infarction (median count, 3.5) than in hemispheres with pattern B infarction or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT (median count, 0; Kruskal-Wallis test, P =.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased embolic count was associated with decreased GSM (Spearman correlation, P =.045, r = -0.22), but not with high degrees of stenosis (Spearman correlation, P =.44, r = 0.086) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Emboli were more frequent in symptomatic than asymptomatic hemispheres and in CT pattern A harboring hemispheres than in CT pattern B or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were more frequent in the presence of low-plaque echodensity, but not in the presence of a high degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data support the embolic nature of cerebrovascular symptomatology and CT pattern A infarctions </plain></SENT>
