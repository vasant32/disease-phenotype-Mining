<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate this discrepancy, 21 rabbits were subjected to embolic occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) by retrograde injection of a tin-tagged, 2-hour-old autologous clot through the external carotid artery with angiographic monitoring in the same manner as in a previously reported model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The emboli lodged intracranially at the bifurcation of the ICA in 10 animals and in the cervical ICA in 11 animals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment started one-half hour after embolization and consisted of a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of rTPA followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/h for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the animals with intracranial emboli and 6 of the animals with cervical emboli were treated intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 5 animals with cervical emboli were treated by intracarotid infusion of the same dose of rTPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the intravenously treated group, serial digital subtraction angiography documented thrombolysis in 9 of the 10 animals with intracranial emboli and only 1 of the 6 with cervical emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis occurred in 4 of the 5 rabbits with cervical emboli treated with intracarotid rTPA </plain></SENT>
