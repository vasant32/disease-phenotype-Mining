<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique, however, has been rarely used for stenosis of the internal carotid artery because of the resultant embolization with debris following balloon manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> with a complaint of transient mono-ocular blindedness, whose ischaemic attack was relieved by <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case, we applied endovascular treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, known as 'seesaw balloon technique', which prevented cerebral embolization with debris from the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This technique may simplify the endovascular treatment for distally located <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and shorten the operation time </plain></SENT>
