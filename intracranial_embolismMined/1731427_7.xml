<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> transport inhibitor L-644,711, which is known to reduce astrocyte swelling and excitotoxin release in primary astrocyte culture, in two models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> to assess its capacity to influence ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two models include autologous clot embolized to the brain via the carotid artery, with one model using a transient period of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was determined by the hydrogen clearance method, intracranial pressure was measured with a fiberoptic transducer, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was assessed with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining of the coronally sectioned brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both models received a 2-hour infusion of L-644,711 (total dose, 12 mg/kg) beginning 20 minutes before embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both the normotensive (p less than 0.01) and the hypotensive (p less than 0.05) model, treatment with L-644,711 resulted in a significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and a significant improvement in regional cerebral blood flow (p less than 0.03, normotensive model, and p less than 0.05, hypotensive model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raised intracranial pressure</z:e>, unique to the hypotensive model, was abolished by the administration of L-644,711 (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A hyperglycemic response associated with embolization, also unique to the hypotensive model, was significantly reduced by the administration of L-644,711 (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ability of L-644,711 to limit brain injury in two related models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> suggests a potential therapeutic role for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> channel blockers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
