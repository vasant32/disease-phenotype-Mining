<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were slightly more women than men (53%) in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (68%) was the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> of the pons, and embolism due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequently noted sites are listed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since cerebral haemorrhage follows the rupture of one or more already damaged deep arteries, as assessment was made of the part played by vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>13 cases due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and 35 to rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the polygon of Willis were discarded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In only 20 cases out of 138 in which convincing microscopic evidence of the vascular situation could be obtained was there an absence of significant alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining cases consisted of serious <z:mpath ids='MPATH_40'>hyalinosis</z:mpath> (56%), fibrinoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (13%), and siderocalciosis (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An account is also given of the special pathogenetic conditions applicable to cerebral haemorrhage associated wtih serious gastrointestinal haemorrhage or recent myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
