<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total middle cerebral artery territory counts were calculated using the region-of-interest method and compared to cerebellar regional counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>99mTc-HMPAO uptake on SPECT scans was increased at the beginning and at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, compared to baseline preoperative values (11-17%) in the presence of multiple microembolic signals on TCD (n1 = 35 and n2 = 42 for unilateral middle cerebral artery monitoring) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the feasibility of using HMPAO-SPECT to study brain perfusion changes during cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A combination of SPECT and TCD ultrasonography may be used to study the impact of microembolism during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
