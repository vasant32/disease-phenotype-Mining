<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spin-echo (SE) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images (MRI) were obtained before and after the administration of Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>, and correlative CT scans were performed on the same day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases, 4 h and 27 months after the ictus, there was no enhancement with Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was faint enhancement in 2 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of about 24 h duration and obvious enhancement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with enhanced CT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> using Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> demonstrated more obvious enhancement of infarcted areas </plain></SENT>
