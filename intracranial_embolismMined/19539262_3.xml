<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the prevalence of secondary right-to-left circulatory shunt (RLS) in patients undergoing transcatheter closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) as detected by power M-mode transcranial Doppler (TCD) and intracardiac echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prevalence of residual RLS in late follow-up after <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure may be as high as 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other cardiac and noncardiac sources of RLS may coexist and obscure <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-eight patients who underwent transcatheter <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure to prevent recurrent paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> between June 2005 and December 2006 were evaluated for a secondary source of RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before device deployment, a sizing balloon was inflated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> tunnel and agitated saline contrast was injected into the inferior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant secondary RLS was defined as &gt;10 embolic tracks on TCD at rest or immediately after calibrated (40 mm Hg), sustained (10 s) respiratory strain, with corresponding negative color-flow Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late residual RLS was evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with TCD and transthoracic echocardiography (mean: 192 days; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 161 to 223 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sample (n = 84) was 59% female, age 49 +/- 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (20%; 95% CI: 11.7 to 28.8) had secondary RLS during balloon occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At late follow-up (n = 66), 13 of 14 (93%) patients with secondary RLS and 23 of 52 (44%) patients without secondary RLS had residual RLS (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to systematically assess the prevalence of secondary RLS in patients undergoing <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Residual RLS detected by TCD may be due to secondary RLS, which may have implications for clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
