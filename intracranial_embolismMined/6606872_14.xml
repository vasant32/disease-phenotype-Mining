<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow CBF was studied in 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and arteriosclerotic neck vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured by a rapidly rotating single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomograph using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-133 inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This method yields images of 3 brain slices depicting CBF with a spatial resolution of 1.7 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based primarily on the clinical evidence and on the angiographical findings embolism was considered the pathogenetic factor in 10 cases, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodynamic insufficiency rendered symptomatic by postural factors probably accounted for the symptoms in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied days to weeks after the most recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, four showed hypoperfused areas on the CBF-tomograms and with roughly the same location hypodense areas on CT-scanning, i.e. areas of complete infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, an additional five patients showed reduction of CBF in areas with no abnormality on the CT-scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abnormal blood flow pattern was found to be unchanged after clinically successful reconstructive vascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests the presence of irreversible ischemic tissue damage without gross emollition (incomplete infarction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> are often harmful events, as no less than 9 of the 14 patients studied had evidence of complete and/or incomplete infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thorough examination and rational therapy should be instituted as soon as possible to prevent further ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
