<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the perioperative and 3-year follow-up results of 103 consecutive carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedures done with a transcervical approach using carotid flow reversal for cerebral protection that were performed over a 28-month period in 97 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mean age of these patients was 72 years, and 82 (80%) were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean preoperative internal carotid artery (ICA) peak systolic velocity was 314 cm/s, 36% of treated hemispheres were symptomatic, and 42% of patients had neurologic symptoms for &gt;6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (10%) had contralateral ICA occlusion, six (6%) had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, and two (2%) had previous neck radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local anesthesia was used in 72 (70%) cases and general in 31 (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predilatation was used in 34 cases (33%), and closed-cell self-expanding stents were deployed and postdilated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 100 cases (97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (1%), one contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (1%), and two minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2%) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were two wound complications (2%) and one major arterial complication (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean operative time was 69 minutes, and mean carotid flow reversal time was 21 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three awake patients (4%) did not tolerate carotid flow reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> occurred in 24 cases (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No electrocardiographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At 40 months of follow-up, the stent patency rate on an intention-to-treat basis was 95%, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival was 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcervical CAS with carotid flow reversal can be done with a high rate of technical success, a negligible rate of major adverse events, and an excellent 3-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival and stent patency rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results compare favorably with those of recently published prospective studies using distal filter protection during CAS </plain></SENT>
