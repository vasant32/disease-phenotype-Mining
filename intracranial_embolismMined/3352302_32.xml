<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or clinically evident cerebrovascular disease were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bubble oxygenation and nonpulsatile perfusion were used for bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 31 to 167 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 (100%) patients had <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular occlusions indicative of microembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiograms obtained preoperatively and in five patients immediately before bypass but after aortic cannulation showed <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During bypass there was a mean of 3.5 (range 1 to 7) blocked arterioles of less than 50 micron caliber and a mean of 6.3 (range 1 to 10) focal areas of capillary nonperfusion per 30-degree field of retina centered on the macula per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repeat studies 30 minutes after discontinuation of bypass showed partial reperfusion with occlusions in four of the five (80%) patients and a decrease in the mean total microembolic count from 12.6 to 4.8 (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In later studies at a median of 8 days postoperatively, only two of 16 (12.5%) patients had persistently occluded <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total microembolic count did not correlate with bypass time (r = 0.14) and was not reduced by arterial line filtration with a Pall 40 micron filter (Ultipore) in a subgroup of 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients completed four standardized psychometric tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> microvascular occlusions were more numerous in those patients with a psychometric deficit (n = 7) than in those with no deficit (n = 13; p = 0.075) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a dog model of cardiopulmonary bypass, eight of nine (88.9%) had <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular occlusions after 10 to 90 minutes of bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> histologic studies revealed intravascular platelet-fibrin microaggregates 20 to 70 micron in diameter and focal ischemic changes in seven of the nine (77.8%) dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six dogs undergoing sham bypass had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> perfusion and histologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates a very high incidence of microvascular occlusions in the territory of the internal carotid artery during bypass consistent with a microembolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain </plain></SENT>
