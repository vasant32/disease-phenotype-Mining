<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The microsurgical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA) has been defined in 50 cerebral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distal ACA, the portion beginning at the anterior communicating artery (ACoA), was divided into four segments (A2 through A5) according to Fischer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distal ACA gave origin to central and cerebral branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The central branches passed to the optic chiasm, suprachiasmatic area, and anterior forebrain below the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebral branches were divided into cortical, subcortical, and callosal branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent site of origin of the cortical branches was as follows: orbitofrontal and frontopolar arteries, A2; the anterior and middle internal frontal and callosomarginal arteries, A3; the paracentral artery, A4; and the superior and inferior parietal arteries, A5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The posterior internal frontal artery arose with approximately equal frequency from A3 and A4 and callosomarginal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cortical branches arose more frequently from the pericallosal than the callosomarginal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the major cortical branches, the internal frontal and paracentral arteries arose most frequently from the callosomarginal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The distal ACA of one hemisphere sent branches to the contralateral hemisphere in 64% of brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The anterior portions of the hemisphere between the 5-cm and 15-cm points on the circumferential line showed the most promise of revealing a recipient artery of sufficient size for an extracranial-intracranial artery anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The distal ACA was the principal artery supplying the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The recurrent artery, which arose from the A2 segment in 78% of hemispheres, sent branches into the subcortical area around the anterior limb of the internal capsule </plain></SENT>
