<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The only treatment was evacuation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo> by trephination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the child was 3 years old, images of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> were not found although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the intracranial vessels were angiographically explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is considered that the reduced pressure in the right cranial cavity due to the drainage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo> may contribute to the occlusion of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> by causing a slight displacement of the intracranial structures towards the side of the drained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
