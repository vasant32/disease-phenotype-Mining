<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010522'>Aortic calcification</z:mp> or disease requiring replacement precludes aortic cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical experience with axillary artery cannulation led to the hypothesis that axillary cannulation may be cerebroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five mongrel dogs underwent a median sternotomy and isolation of the right axillary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The canine bicarotid brachiocephalic trunk was reconfigured by grafting the origin of the left carotid to the proximal left subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microspheres were injected into the ascending aorta during 4 conditions: before and after reconfiguration, CPB with aortic cannulation, and CPB with axillary cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain, kidneys, and skeletal muscle were analyzed for microsphere distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each animal served as its own control for comparison of aortic and axillary cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were documented in microsphere deposition for prereconfiguration and postreconfiguration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the right middle cerebral artery distribution, 2300 +/- 710 microspheres per gram were deposited during aortic cannulation, compared with 540 +/- 110 during axillary cannulation (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the left middle cerebral artery region, 2030 +/- 330 microspheres per gram with aortic cannulation were reduced to 1320 +/- 240 with axillary cannulation (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Axillary cannulation resulted in 73% fewer microspheres in the right brain and 40% fewer microspheres in the left compared with aortic cannulation (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Axillary artery cannulation for CPB is cerebroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Altered blood-flow patterns during axillary cannulation may produce retrograde brachiocephalic artery blood flow and competing intracerebral right-to-left collateral blood flow, deflecting emboli from the ascending aorta and arch toward the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Expanded use of axillary artery cannulation during cardiac operations could decrease the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
