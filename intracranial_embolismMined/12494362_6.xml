<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment is very important as an alternative or combined technique if direct surgery is impossible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report a young male who presented with a 2 nd episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> in basal ganglion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> with mild right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His 3D-CT scan revealed left ruptured partially thrombosed giant M1 fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and left unruptured C3 saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He underwent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass with attempted M1 reconstruction and a week later attempted total occlusion of the M1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But only a ruptured point at the distal M1 was occluded which, however, resulted in temporary mild right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A month later when he was supposed to have his 2 nd coiling procedure his angiogram demonstrated spontaneous and complete obliteration of both the M1 and C3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> without any new neurological deficit, so no further endovascular procedure was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The discussion is based on this case and previous reports regarding difficult giant M1 fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, its treatment and spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of aneurysmal sac after bypass and distal occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions are drawn that 1) spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of M1 and C3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> should be the result of hemodynamic alteration in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> due to a lower flow velocity induced by distal bypass and distal occlusion of M1, 2) combined distal bypass and endovascular obliteration of the aneurysmal sac with coils is a good alternative if vascular reconstruction is difficult or impossible </plain></SENT>
