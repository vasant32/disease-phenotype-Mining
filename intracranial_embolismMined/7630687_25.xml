<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected on children over 1 month of age who had or developed a thrombotic event from 1987 through 1993 at two pediatric centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-one children (mean age, 10 years) suffered a thrombotic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Males and females were equally affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A variety of clinical prothrombotic conditions similar to those described in adults could be identified for two thirds of the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family history was positive in seven children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary thrombotic site for two thirds of the children was the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and other centrally located blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of the primary thrombotic site was primarily by ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A central vascular access device was associated with 25% of thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lung involvement occurred in 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two thirds of the children were evaluated for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and a deficiency of protein C and protein S; two thirds had one of these diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For further analyses, children without an underlying prothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic illness</z:e> or precipitant at the time of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 20) were compared to those with these conditions (n = 41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system thromboses were significantly increased in the children without prothrombotic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of a deficiency of protein C or protein S or the presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> approached 90% in the group without prothrombotic conditions as compared with 50% in the other group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that prospective multicenter pediatric <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary findings of a high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and protein C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> in children with thromboses </plain></SENT>
