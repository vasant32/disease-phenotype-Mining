<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been greatly enhanced by studies employing nonhuman primate models of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, devastating neurological disability in previously described <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models has led to ethical concerns and difficulty achieving prolonged survival for the evaluation of long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined if reversible occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery in baboons would produce a small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with minimal neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In six baboons, anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, Guglielmi coils were placed by endovascular technique in the anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two baboons coils were placed for 3 h at the proximal A2 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four baboons coils were placed at the junction of the A2 and A3 segments of the anterior cerebral artery for 1.5 h (n = 2) or 3 h (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The coils were removed and reperfusion confirmed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the animals were awakened from anesthesia and brain MRI studies were performed at 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baboons awakened with minimal neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals subject to occlusion at the proximal A2 segment and animals subject to 1.5 h of occlusion at the junction of A2 and A3 had no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Animals with 3-h occlusion at the junction of A2 and A3 showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of 3.5% and 2.8% of cerebral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that reversible anterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may provide a new humane animal model for small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and limited neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
