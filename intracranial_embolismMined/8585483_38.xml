<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients (mean age, 56 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were studied clinically and with CT and angiography before and after thrombolytic therapy with intravenous alteplase (n = 16), superselective intraarterial alteplase (n = 8), and superselective intraarterial urokinase (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial CT showed a large parenchymal hypodensity in 11 (34%) patients, a small hypodensity in 15 (47%) patients, and no hypodensity in 6 (19%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recanalization after thrombolytic therapy was observed in 4 patients (12.5% in each treatment group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up CT showed six hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and four parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> unrelated to recanalization, alteplase, or urokinase administration, but commonly associated with intraarterial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was fatal in 53%, poor in 31%, and moderate or good in 16% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was equal in different treatment groups and closely linked to both the quality of leptomeningeal collaterals and the extent of parenchymal hypodensity on the first CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because intravenous or intraarterial treatment with alteplase or urokinase fails to recanalize the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular obstruction</z:e>, it does not improve the prognosis of intracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> over that of the natural course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improved results may be possible with novel recanalization techniques </plain></SENT>
