<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cellulose <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> polymer (CAP) is a new liquid embolic material that has been used experimentally in intravascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But this compound is still controversial in some aspects such as safety, efficiency, and histological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we re-evaluated the material with regard to intravascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The carotid arteries of rats and experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in canines were embolized with CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of CAP were evaluated according to angiographic and histological results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A strong chemo-corrosive effect was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This led to severe damage to vessels and rupture of two thrombosed canine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant technical difficulties including out-flow of CAP and a high rate of occlusion of the parent arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that currently CAP is not an ideal embolic material for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further tests and improvements are needed before it can be widely used clinically </plain></SENT>
