<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pertinent data were collected from hospital records, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates and autopsy reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of cerebrovascular disease in these areas was 138/100 000 and the incidence was generally higher in men than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (INF) and that of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (HGE) were similar in men and women less than 50 years old; thereafter the incidence of INF increased faster with age than did that of HGE, the disparity being greater in men than in women, whereas the incidence of HGE increased at similar rates in the two sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of INF was significantly greater in men than in women in urban areas, and in men it was greater in urban than in rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated concentrations of serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and smoking are implicated as risk factors in INF, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as a risk factor in HGE </plain></SENT>
