<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Identification of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is often limited by the difficulties involved in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> or the risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients in sinus rhythm with nondiagnostic transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and without carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> represent a subset in whom diagnostic recommendations are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the value of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for diagnosis and therapy in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with the characteristics described above were studied prospectively with the use of blood analysis, TTE, TEE, and Holter monitoring (in patients with atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TTE was abnormal in 16 of 30 patients, but no embolic source was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TEE disclosed left atrial appendage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in 3 of 30 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> in 2 of 30 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> in 7 of 30 patients, and aortic plaques in 19 of 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Tee resulted in a change of therapy in 3 of the 30 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that TEE is a helpful diagnostic tool in delineating the risk of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and demonstrates significant pathology even in a subset of patients deemed to be at low risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This additional new information led to a substantial change in therapy in 3 of 30 patients </plain></SENT>
