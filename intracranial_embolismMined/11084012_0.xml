<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after the bilateral cavo-pulmonary shunt (Glenn) has been rarely reported and almost always occurs around the anastomosis itself or near it, mainly causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present 2 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> 2-7 months after pulmonary artery closure and Glenn procedure, due to dislodgement of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the proximal pulmonary artery stump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these two cases and a few others reported in the literature, we want to call the attention to this new cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> after Glenn and stimulate discussion about its incidence, risk factors and preventive measures </plain></SENT>
