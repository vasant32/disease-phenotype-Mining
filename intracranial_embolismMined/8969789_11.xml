<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The capability of transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) to detect a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, which provocative maneuver and what timing of contrast injection are most effective to induce a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected 38 cerebrovascular patients (21 men, 17 women) with positive contrast study for <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> on transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a TCD with bilateral monitoring of the middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) and injection of a contrast solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The injection was repeated (1) during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breathing (basal conditions); (2) before Valsalva maneuver (VM); (3) during VM; (4) immediately after VM; and (5) during cough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latency time and the total number of microbubbles for each side were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TCD found positive results for <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty were positive even during basal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of positive cases varied according to the timing of the VM in relation to the contrast injection: 28, 25, and 27 cases were positive when the injection was performed before, during, and after VM, respectively, while 26 were positive during cough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the number of microbubbles in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> between the procedures (P &lt; .001, ANOVA): the highest number was detected in the injection before VM and the lowest number during basal conditions (P &lt; .001, Wilcoxon's test with Bonferroni's correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latency time was significantly shorter when the injection followed VM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The injection performed before VM appeared to be the most effective TCD procedure in determining the transit of microbubbles through a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and subsequently in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
