<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the assumption that the course of a balloon is determined by the same hydrodynamic laws as that of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> of similar size, it is concluded that the majority of occlusions of the cerebral arteries are of embolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emboli, then, might also be an explanation for most of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
