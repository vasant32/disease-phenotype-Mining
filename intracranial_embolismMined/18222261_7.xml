<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carbon dioxide (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>) field flooding is reported to reduce residual intracavital air during cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A protective effect of carbon dioxide insufflation on postoperative brain function remains unproven in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty patients undergoing heart valve operations by median sternotomy were randomly assigned to either <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> insufflation (group I, n = 39) or unprotected controls (group II, n = 41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative evaluation included neurocognitive test batteries consisting of six different tests, and objective measurements of brain function by means of P300 wave auditory-evoked potentials (peak latencies, ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitive testing and P300 measurements were repeated on postoperative day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitive deficit (ND) was defined as a 20% decrement in two or more tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperatively, P300 peak latencies did not differ between groups (374 +/- 75 vs 366 +/- 72 ms, not significant [n.s.]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five days after surgery, P300 peak latencies were significantly shorter with <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> protection as compared with the unprotected control group (group I: 390 +/- 68 ms, group II: 429 +/- 75 ms, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was comparable as for mortality (group I: 1 patient; group II: 2 patients) and cerebrovascular events or confusional syndromes (group I: 5 patients; group II: 4 patients) or other clinical variables as intubation time or hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitive test batteries did not reveal differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Shorter P300 peak latencies after surgery indicate less brain damage in patients who underwent heart valve operations with <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> flooding of the thoracic cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Even if these findings were not supported by clinical results or neurocognitive test batteries in our cohort, carbon dioxide field flooding has proven efficiency and should be advocated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing open heart surgery </plain></SENT>
