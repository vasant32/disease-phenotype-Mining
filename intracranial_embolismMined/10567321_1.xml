<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (<z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>) has decreased in popularity over the past decade because of its complexity and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) perfusion imaging to assess flow distribution in both hemispheres of the brain during unilateral <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> through the right carotid artery via a cannula placed in the right axillary artery in conjunction with hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve pigs were randomly exposed to 120 minutes of either bilateral <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> through both carotid arteries (n=6) or unilateral <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> through the right axillary artery (n=6) at pressures of 60 to 65 mm Hg at 15 degrees C, followed by 60 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion images were acquired every 30 minutes before, during, and after <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain was perfusion fixed for histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During initial normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion imaging showed a uniform distribution of flow in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both the bilateral and unilateral <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> groups, the same pattern was maintained, with an increase in regional cerebral blood volume during <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The changes in regional cerebral blood volume and mean transit time were similar in both hemispheres during and after unilateral <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histopathology showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of the brain in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both bilateral <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> and unilateral <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> provide uniform blood distribution to both hemispheres of the brain and preserve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the neurons after prolonged hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
