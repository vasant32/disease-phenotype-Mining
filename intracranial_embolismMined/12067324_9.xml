<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The cause of small infarction is mainly considered to be intracranial small-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is difficult to explain the mechanism of multiple, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarctions by small-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the differences of clinical parameters between patients with multiple small lesions and single lesion detected by Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical records of 86 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with lacunar size ischemic lesions on DWI during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage (within 72 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 55 males and 31 females (mean age 72.4 +/- 9.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions were defined using the following criteria 1): the lesions were detectable by DWI 2), the diameter of each lesion on DWI was less than 1.5 cm, and 3) more than one vascular territory was involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Included in the analysis were age, sex, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) levels, hematocrit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (Af), stenosis of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), internal carotid artery (ICA) or basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> detected by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) at admission, and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one (24.4%) out of 86 patients with small <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarctions had multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that Af and stenosis of ICA or basilar artery were significantly more prevalent in patients with multiple lesions than single lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multiple, small lesions visible in DWI are likely to be caused by emboli from heart or atheroma of the large vessels than single small lesion </plain></SENT>
