<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is associated with increased morbidity and twice the mortality compared to individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs has limited effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: The group of patients comprised 59 men and 13 women with an average age of 51 +/- 10, the majority of whom had failed several drug regimens; some had undergone repeated DC conversions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A new method based on radiofrequency ablation and isolation of pulmonary veins from the left atrium may offer curative treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basis for this method is that foci in or close to the pulmonary veins initiate or drive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These foci may be identified by transseptal access to the left atrium and isolation of the veins from the left atrium using radiofrequency energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The group of 72 patients underwent 86 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Foci were observed in 65.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Isolation of 3.1 +/- 0.9 veins was performed in 71 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a follow up period of 10.3 +/- 5.1 months, 60.9% reported absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> and 81.2% reported cure or considerable improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications included drainage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> in one patient, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> with partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> in one patient, and an asymptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0010438'>pulmonary vein stenosis</z:mp> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> can be treated in selected patients using pulmonary vein isolation with low to moderate risk of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Longer follow up is necessary for full evaluation of effect </plain></SENT>
