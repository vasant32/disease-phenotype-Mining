<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken in 64 patients, 50 with mechanical and 14 with porcine prosthetic valves, to evaluate the incidence of intracranial emboli and their distribution in the basal cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were studied using transcranial Doppler (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e> TC2-64B, Uberlingen, Germany), with a monitoring time of two minutes over each of the internal carotid arteries, middle and anterior cerebral arteries, vertebral arteries and the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three of the 64 patients were stabilized on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> at the time of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of emboli signals was significantly higher in patients with mechanical compared to porcine cardiac valves (88% versus 14%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of emboli signals was significantly higher in the anterior compared with the posterior circulation, with a median of eight signals in the internal carotid arteries (95% confidence interval 5-15), 2.5 in the vertebral arteries (95% confidence interval 1-5.5)(p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also significantly higher in those patients who had undergone double (aortic and mitral) as opposed to those who had undergone single aortic valve replacement: 18 versus two signals per minute (confidence intervals 5-30.5 versus 0.5-3.5) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that subclinical emboli signals are readily detectable using transcranial Doppler and are common in patients with prosthetic heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their number depends on both the type and the number of the prosthesis, while their distribution in the basal cerebral arteries is consistent with their cardiac source </plain></SENT>
