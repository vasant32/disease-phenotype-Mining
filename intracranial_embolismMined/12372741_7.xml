<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath>, free fatty acid is more toxic than neutral fat in terms of tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the hyperacute embolic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> in cat brains by using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging were performed in cat brains after the injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> (group 1, n = 8) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> (group 2, n = 10) into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were quantitatively assessed by comparing the signal intensity ratios of the lesions with their counterparts on T2-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic findings in group 1 were compared with those in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Qualitatively, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images revealed two types of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 1 lesions were hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images and hypointense on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 2 lesions were isointense or mildly hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images and isointense on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantitatively, the signal intensity ratios of type 1 lesions in group 2 specimens were significantly higher on T2-weighted images (P =.013)/(P =.027) and lower on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps compared with those of group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of type 1 lesions in both groups revealed more prominent widening of the perivascular space and swelling of the neural cells in group 2, in contrast to notable endothelial defects in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and electron microscopic data on cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> induced by either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> revealed characteristics suggestive of both vasogenic and cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the hyperacute stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tissue damage appeared more severe in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> group than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
