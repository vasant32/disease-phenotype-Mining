<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Epiaortic two-dimensional echocardiography was performed before cannulation and after decannulation in 188 (124 men) patients (mean age, 67.7 years; range, 43 to 86 years) undergoing operation with extracorporeal circulation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> during 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After decannulation, a new intimal lesion was recognized in 10 of 188 patients (5.3%): mobile type in 5 patients (3 ending with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> [60%], 2 having brain computed tomographic scans compatible with embolism), intimal tear in 2, and intimal irregularity in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> occurred in a significantly smaller number of patients (2 of 178 [1.1%]; p &lt; 0.001) without new lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clamp- or cannula-induced new lesions, especially of mobile type, are often complicated by postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aggressive surgical technique modifications may need to be considered to avoid creating new lesions, particularly of the mobile type </plain></SENT>
