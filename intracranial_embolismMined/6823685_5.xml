<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 39 patients suffering a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> caused by a cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, 38 were submitted to CT within 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients received direct full anticoagulation and, in 10 patients, treatment was delayed because of hemorrhagic infarction on initial CT (3 cases), cardiac cause 24 hours or more after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, or treatment delay without specific reason (6 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with severe deficit were not anticoagulated because of hemorrhagic signs on initial CT, impaired consciousness, or general contra-indications to such treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one follow-up CT-scans were performed under full anti-coagulation, and in only 2 cases hemorrhagic infarction was noticed without clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No clinical worsening attributable to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment was observed during the three week observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that direct anticoagulation therapy does neither induce hemorrhagic infarction nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in patients with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> nor does it cause clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
