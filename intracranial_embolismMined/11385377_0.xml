<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to evaluate the prevalence and counts of Doppler microembolic signals in patients with St Jude Medical valves (St Jude Medical, Inc, St Paul, Minn) and patients with ATS valves (ATS Medical, Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) and their relation to clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 179 outpatients of the department of cardiothoracic surgery were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They included 98 men and 81 women, aged 61 +/- 11 years, with ATS (n = 91) or St Jude Medical (n = 88) valves in the aortic (n = 110), mitral (n = 39), or both positions (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic examination was followed by transcranial Doppler monitoring for microembolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monitoring was performed bilaterally over the middle cerebral arteries for 1 hour per session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microembolic signal counts and prevalence were significantly higher in patients with St Jude Medical as compared with ATS valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Valve type and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were the only predictors of microembolic signal prevalence on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No influence of microembolic signals on cerebral embolic complications was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, patients with a postoperative history of cerebral embolic complications did not have a higher number of microembolic signals than remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interobserver variability was satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with St Jude Medical valves were shown to have significantly higher microembolic signal counts than patients with ATS valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, our results suggest that microembolic signal counts cannot be used to predict cerebral embolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Their relation to neuropsychologic deficits remains to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
