<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Argatroban is a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied argatroban locally during carotid endarterectomy to prevent local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although local delivery of argatroban is expected to be effective for inhibition of mural clot formation, there is no report of the evaluation of its clinical effectiveness or local drug concentration in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five mg of argatroban (0.5 mg/ml) was applied twice intraoperatively just after arteriotomy for measurement of intraplaque level of argatroban and during closure of the arteriotomy for preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After exposure of the carotid plaque to argatroban for a specified duration (0, 3, 5, or 10 min), argatroban was sufficiently washed with saline and the carotid plaque was removed for measurement of tissue concentration of argatroban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraplaque level of argatroban was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A second application was performed during closure of the arteriotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Argatroban was applied for 10 minutes, followed by washing with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative embolic cerebrovascular complications and carotid restenosis also were investigated to verify the efficacy of direct local application of argatroban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tissue levels of argatroban in the carotid plaque after 3, 5, and 10 minutes of direct application were 24.0 +/- 13.7, 31.6 +/- 20.0, and 44.0 +/- 15.1 mug/g, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The concentrations at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points were significantly elevated compared with the control, and a significant difference in concentration was observed between 3 minutes and 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the present study, concentration at 3 minutes was much higher than the effective tissue levels of argatroban reported in experimental studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient developed postoperative cerebrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that direct local application of argatroban during carotid endarterectomy for at least 3 minutes may deliver high local tissue levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Argatroban may be effective for prevention of perioperative embolic cerebral complications during carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
