<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether subsequent pregnancies increase the risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and whether the occurrence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> affects reproductive history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors identified 489 consecutive women aged 15 to 40 years with a first-ever arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> from the record system of nine French neurologic centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence and reproductive history was obtained by means of chart review, written questionnaire, and telephone interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were analyzed from 441 women (373 with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 68 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 5 years, 13 arterial recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall risk of recurrence was 1% within 1 year and 2.3% within 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of recurrence was significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of definite cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred outside pregnancy (absolute risk of recurrence = 0.5%; 95% CI 0.3, 0.95) and two during pregnancy or the puerperium (absolute risk of recurrence = 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>8%; 95% CI 0.5, 7.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of recurrence was significantly higher during the postpartum period (risk ratio = 9.7; 95% CI 1.2, 78.9) than during pregnancy (risk ratio = 2.2; 95% CI 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>3, 17.5) itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The outcome of the 187 subsequent pregnancies was similar to that expected from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four percent of women indicated that they would have desired more pregnancies after their initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The main reasons for not considering pregnancy were concern of a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, medical advice against pregnancy, and residual handicap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Young women with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> have a low risk of recurrence during subsequent pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The postpartum period, not the pregnancy itself, is associated with an increased risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The outcome of pregnancies in these women appears to be similar to that expected in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is not a contraindication to a subsequent pregnancy </plain></SENT>
