<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of filter trapping was examined using the same models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> model of the carotid artery system with model blood clot was incorporated in a laboratory pulsatile flow system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolectomy was performed using the Merci Retrieval System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Any clot not evacuated through the balloon guide catheter was trapped with a distal protection filter device developed for cervical stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clot could not be sucked into the guide catheter by the recommended procedures in nine of 15 trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trapping failed in only one trial, in which the clot passed through a gap between the edge of the filter orifice and the inner model lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A clot was withdrawn to the catheter tip trapped across the edge of the orifice frame in one trial, and a very large clot was trapped across the filter orifice in two trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even clots made by the same method showed variation in properties, especially hardness, which may affect the effectiveness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> procedure recommended for the Merci Retrieval System did not remove the large clots formed by embolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The trapping procedure using a filter device without an orifice frame was effective to solve this problem </plain></SENT>
