<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001987'>hyperammonemia</z:hpo>, who died after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 71-year-old man who had been diagnosed as having Bence Jones protein (kappa)-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> in 1996 was readmitted to our hospital in February 1997 because of worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> yielded an almost dry tap, and the bone marrow was found to be completely occupied by immature plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> was slight, the serum ammonia level was high and increased gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite treatment, the patient died due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and progression of plasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in October 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood sampled at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> showed a serum ammonia level of 204 micrograms/dl, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> calls were cultured using monolayered bone marrow stromal cells as feeder cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This led to the successful establishment of a cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of ammonia in the supernatant was high, indicating that the cultured <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells produced and released ammonia </plain></SENT>
