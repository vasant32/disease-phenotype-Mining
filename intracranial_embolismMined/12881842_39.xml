<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of using motor imagery training in the rehabilitation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A before-after trial with clinical and behavioral analyses of single cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic-affiliated rehabilitation hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two survivors of embolic middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: A motor imagery training program consisting of imagined wrist movements (extension, pronation-<z:mp ids='MP_0008909'>supination</z:mp>) and mental simulations of reaching and object manipulation making use of a mirror box apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve 1-hour experimental sessions were delivered, 3 times a week for 4 consecutive weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main Outcome Measures: Two clinical assessments, grip strength, 4 wrist functionality measurements, and 3 timed performance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> outcome measures were recorded before training began, at 3 times during the intervention month, with 2 additional long-term measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Performance of the paretic limb improved after the imagery intervention, indicated by increases in assessment scores and functionality and decreases in movement times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The improvements over baseline performance remained stable over a 3-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the potential for using motor imagery as a cognitive strategy for functional recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intervention targets the cognitive level of action processing while its effects may be realized in overt behavioral performance </plain></SENT>
