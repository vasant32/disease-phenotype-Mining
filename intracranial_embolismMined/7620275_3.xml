<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On physical examination 13/20 patients (65%) with PAPS had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 12/20 (60%) patients with PAPS the ECG was abnormal, mainly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> in 5 (25%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in 3 (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 7/20 patients with PAPS (35%) abnormal pulmonary findings were detected by X-ray and in 6 (30%) they were related to dilated pulmonary arch and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 14/20 cases (70%) with PAPS, abnormal echocardiographic findings were present; 13/20 patients (65%) had valvular complications attributable to PAPS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> in six cases; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in three and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary artery hypertension</z:hpo> and two, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> (one attributable to PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> valve diseases were regurgitant with mild to moderate hemodynamic repercussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No stenotic lesions were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean mitral thickness in patients with mitral valve involvement was 7.0 +/- 1.6 mm, compared to 2.8 +/- 0.7 mm in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valves and 3.1 +/- 0.9 mm in the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean aortic valve thickness in patients with aortic valve involvement was 3.6 +/- 0.5 mm compared to 1.5 +/- 0.3 mm in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valves and 1.4 +/- 0.4 in the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients from the control group had valve disease (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three cases (15%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> diagnosed by echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients with PAPS died during the 4.7 +/- 1.2 years of cardiological follow up, due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cardiologic complications are common in PAPS, including left side regurgitant lesions that might be hemodynamically significant, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
