<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> are cardioembolic in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is widely regarded as the initial study of choice for evaluating cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> occur in elderly patients, the value of TEE in this population is poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared 491 patients older than 65 years with suspected embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) who had undergone TEE evaluation between April 2000 and February 2004 to an age-, sex-, and time-matched control group that consisted of 252 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were reviewed for abnormalities associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors was significantly higher in the study than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the four patients with left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although ascending and aortic arch sessile atheromata were observed more frequently in the study than control group, there were no significant differences in the incidence of either complex or mobile aortic atheromata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> was higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> group, but not in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, there were also no differences in the incidence of spontaneous echocontrast, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> between study and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude: (1) There is a higher incidence of abnormalities implicated as sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> on TEE in elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e>, but (2) this incidence is driven by the presence of sessile aortic atheroma and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Until the benefits of specific therapies for these conditions are known, routine TEE in elderly patients with suspected embolic neurological events appears to be unwarranted </plain></SENT>
