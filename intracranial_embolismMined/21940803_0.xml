<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transforaminal CS injections have been associated with severe adverse <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> events, including brain and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to describe the static and dynamic microscopic appearances of CS preparations, with an emphasis on their potential to cause adverse central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system events by embolic mechanisms during transforaminal injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pharmaceutical preparations of nondilute injectable CSs were used after appropriate mixing: MPA (40 mg/mL), TA (40 mg/mL), and DSP (8 mg/2 mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For dynamic imaging, a novel methodology was devised to replicate the flow of crystals within spinal cord arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, CS preparations were mixed with plasma to assess for changes in crystal size, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and tendency to aggregate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CS preparations MPA and TA are composed of crystals of varying sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MPA crystal size range was 0.4-26 μm (mean, 6.94 μm), TA crystal size range 0.5-110 μm (mean, 17.4 μm), and DSP did not contain any significant crystals or particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no change in the crystal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> or propensity to aggregate after mixing with <z:chebi fb="39" ids="36333">local anesthetic</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After mixing with plasma, the crystals also were unchanged; however, there was a significant reduction in the size of aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On dynamic imaging, these aggregates were proved to maintain their integrity and to act as potential embolization agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MPA and TA have a substantial risk of causing infarction by embolization if inadvertently injected intra-arterially at the time of TFESI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DSP is completely soluble and microscopically has no potential to obstruct arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When performing cervical TFESI procedures, the administration of insoluble CSs should be avoided </plain></SENT>
