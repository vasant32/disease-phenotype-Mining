<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in patients with an unknown source of embolization is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The advent of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the more frequent use of computed tomography (CT) have led to the identification of mural aortic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> (MAT) as a source of distal embolization in a much higher proportion of patients than previously appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with MAT is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective study, from January 1996 to December 1998, 89 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic events underwent an extensive diagnostic workup, consisting of TEE, CT, or MRI, to detect the source of embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom the heart (n = 51), occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306762" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortoiliac disease</z:e> (n = 16), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 12) was identified as the source of embolization were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five female and three male patients, with a median age of 63 years (range, 35 to 76 years), with bilateral or repetitive embolic events resulting from MAT were identified, representing 9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with arterial thrombembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had several risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, but only one young patient had a single risk factor that promoted <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Successful percutaneous catheter <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> embolectomy was performed in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining two patients underwent surgical thromboembolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A below-knee <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> had to be performed in two patients, thus representing a morbidity of the primary treatment of 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MAT of equal value were detected in the ascending (n = 1) and thoracic aorta (n = 3) by means of TEE, CT, or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MAT in the abdominal aorta (n = 4) were identified by means of CT and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgical removal of MAT was performed in seven patients by means of graft replacement of the ascending aorta (n = 1), open thrombectomy of the descending aorta (n = 2), and thrombendarterectomy of the abdominal aorta (n = 4), without intraoperative or postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No recurrence of MAT occurred during a median follow-up period of 13 months (range, 4 to 24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MAT represent an important source of arterial thrombembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic workup of the aorta, preferably by means of CT or MRI, should be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom other sources of embolization have been ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The ideal therapeutic approach to these patients still awaits prospective evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, based on our experience, MAT can be successfully treated with a definitive surgical procedure in selected patients, with low mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
