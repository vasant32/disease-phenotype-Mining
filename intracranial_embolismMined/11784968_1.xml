<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumours</z:e> are infrequent, over half are <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most are situated in the cavities of the heart and exceptionally on the valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Embolism towards the arteries of the anterior circulation of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system is the commonest neurological finding, but rarely involves the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: A 79 year old woman who one year before admission had had a right hemiparesia of the face and body, from which she had made a complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three months later she had a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002317'>unsteady gait</z:hpo> which was deviated towards the right and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She attended our institution where magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) studies showed that there were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the territory of the right anterior and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four months later she had a further episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002317'>unsteady gait</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and right hemiparesia of face and body for which she was admitted to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On physical examination there was dysmetry, dysdiadokokinesia and involvement of the third cranial nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies showed the previous lesions and also a new ischaemic lesion of the mesencephalum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A transoesophagic echocardiogram showed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> of approximately 18 x 20 mm, implanted in the mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Study of the resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> showed it to be a <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six months later the patient was asymptomatic and had not relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the association of vascular events of the posterior circulation with <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> of the mitral valve is rare, its clinical importance cannot be overlooked </plain></SENT>
