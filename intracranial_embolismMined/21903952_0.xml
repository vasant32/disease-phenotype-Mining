<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of experimental studies on treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have been performed in young animals; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is primarily a disease of the aged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, using MRI, we evaluated the effects of sildenafil treatment of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in aged animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Aged male Wistar rats (18 months) were subjected to embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and treated daily with saline (n=10) or with sildenafil (n=10) initiated at 24 hours and subsequently for 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements were performed at 24 hours and weekly to 6 weeks after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MRI and histological measurements demonstrated that sildenafil treatment of aged rats significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> and axonal remodeling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared to saline-treated aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow in the angiogenic area was elevated and expansion of the ipsilateral ventricle and, consequently, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was significantly reduced in the sildenafil-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in aged rats with sildenafil significantly augments <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and axonal remodeling, which increased local blood flow and reduced expansion of the ipsilateral ventricle 6 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared to control aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI can be used to investigate brain repair after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in aged rats </plain></SENT>
