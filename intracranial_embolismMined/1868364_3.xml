<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upon achieving criterion on the behavioral task, rats received thrombicischemic lesions, predominantly limited to the medial precentral cortex, induced by injection of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> and illumination of the skull above the target area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beginning six days after surgery, rats were retested on the memory task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to Sham-operated controls (n = 5), rats with precentral cortex lesions (n = 5) demonstrated a retention interval-dependent accuracy deficit (impaired at the longest retention interval only) and slower reaction time (increased response latency) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects were significant only during the first week of postoperative testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats with lesions also demonstrated a greater probability of a choice response throughout the three postoperative test weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that photochemical <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the precentral cortex produces functional, behavioral consequences in rats which can be reliably and objectively measured </plain></SENT>
