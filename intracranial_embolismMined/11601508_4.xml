<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery 0 to 1 hour postoperatively detected embolic signals in 57% of placebo and 42% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> patients, with overall embolic signal counts 46% less for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (p = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two to 3 hours postoperatively, embolic signals were present in 45% of placebo and 27% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> patients, with embolic signal counts 64% less for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (p = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> reduces embolic signals within 3 hours of CEA </plain></SENT>
