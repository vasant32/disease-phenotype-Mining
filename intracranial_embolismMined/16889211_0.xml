<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The material for the study was the number of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in the middle cerebral artery bed and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> in patients operated on for cardiac valvular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the venous drainage procedure, the patients (n = 90) were divided into 3 groups: 1) those (n = 30) with traditional GVD; 2) those (n = 30) with VaVD; 3) those (n = 30) with ARP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study revealed the impact of different venous drainage procedures on the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and the patients' neurological status </plain></SENT>
