<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among 32 patients with late prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> selected from two cooperative retrospective studies, ten had valve replacement: six men and four women, mean age being 48 years, ranging from 23 to 65 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An emergency reoperation was undertaken for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in seven out of ten cases, with an average delay of 6.6 days after the beginning of antibiotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the other three cases, the operation was carried out at the end of 40 days of antibiotic therapy, once for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and twice for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common causative micro organism was the staphylococcus (7 out of 10 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The infected prosthetic valves were, in 8 out of the 10 cases, in the aortic position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome was poor as the mortality rate was 60% (6 out of the 7 patients operated on in an emergency) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> was attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with conduction disturbances and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (2 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> (2 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1168186" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">septicopyemia</z:e> (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients of the ten, after a mean follow up of 10 months, are cured without prosthetic valve dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extreme gravity of prognosis seems related to the microorganism (staphylococcus), to the delay between the beginning of antibiotic therapy and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and finally to the extension of destructive lesions under the prosthetic valve implantation base; the reimplantation of the prosthesis on frail and abscessed tissue implies a substantial risk of disinsertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The indications for systematic early reoperation in cases of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
