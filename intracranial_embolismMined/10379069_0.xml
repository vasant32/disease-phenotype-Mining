<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In ten healthy volunteers we carried out a study to establish the method with which artefacts can most reliably be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Automatic detection of increasing signal intensity misinterpreted 14% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> artifacts as emboli; 1.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> artifacts sounded suspicious for embolism, and 0.6% met the classical criteria of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using simultaneous recording of the flow signal in two sections of the middle cerebral artery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> artifacts were identified on the basis of their simultaneous manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reliable intra-operative differentiation of emboli from artifacts requires attentive, continuous acoustic and visual analysis of signals by an experienced investigator familiar with the surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The introduction of a multiple-depth algorithm might significantly improve the automatic detection program </plain></SENT>
