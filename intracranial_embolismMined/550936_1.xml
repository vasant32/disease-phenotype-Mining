<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both cases presented to the Neurological Unit of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital during 1978 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second case raised interseting questions regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo> associated with altered states of consiousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Until recently <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxomas</z:hpo> were usually a postmortem diagnosis, but now with the effective combination of echocardiography and cine-angiography, cases are being effectively diagnosed and treated </plain></SENT>
