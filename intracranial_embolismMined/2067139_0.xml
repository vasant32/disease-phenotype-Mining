<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in rats by administering microspheres into the right carotid canal, and the time course of changes in cerebral energy metabolism was examined up to the 7th day after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 50% of the operated rats revealed typical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the right hemisphere, cerebral ATP and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphate of the rat on the 1st to 7th day were greatly reduced by the microsphere-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (maximally 52 and 61%, respectively), whereas the tissue <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level was increased on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day after the embolism (maximally 125%), suggesting an induction of microsphere-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes in the tissue metabolites were accompanied by a decrease in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> oxidative phosphorylation measured in the presence of succinate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar trend in the changes of biochemical markers was observed in the left hemisphere, but to a lesser degree or to an insignificant degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological alterations in behavior and cerebral metabolism of microsphere-injected rats tended to return toward the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels on the 7th day after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results provided information on a useful model for therapeutic studies of anti-ischemic agents in the brain </plain></SENT>
