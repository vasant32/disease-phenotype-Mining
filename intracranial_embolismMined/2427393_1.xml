<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its intestinal absorption was demonstrated in dogs by the observation of a prolonged urokinase activity in plasma with a concomitant lytic effect on artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> after intraduodenal administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In situ intestine-liver perfusion experiments in dogs revealed that a plasminogen activator, distinct from the administered urokinase--thus presumed to be a tissue plasminogen activator--was liberated into the circulation in association with intestinal absorption of urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its absorption in men was demonstrated in a cross-over double blind study of oral urokinase on healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results a double blind clinical trial of oral urokinase was performed on 101 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed the usefulness of urokinase treatment, particularly in the early phase after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical effect was influenced by the plasma plasminogen level </plain></SENT>
