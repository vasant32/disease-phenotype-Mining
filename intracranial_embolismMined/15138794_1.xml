<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Protein S deficiency</z:e>, which exists in 0.7% of the population, is a risk factor for <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein branch occlusions and is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A genealogical study was carried out on three generations of one family who exhibited different venous occlusions and subsequent complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four members of the family, spanning three generations, suffered from complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first generation a great uncle died of complications from a deep leg <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second generation, the mother underwent a venous branch <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at the age of 41 with a protein S activity of 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a palsy of the N. abducens developed with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> (presumably post-thrombotic) in the MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography showed a typical picture of a venous branch occlusion which had been treated by laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the third generation, the 16-year-old daughter developed iliac <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> with a protein S activity of 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography showed distinctively engorged veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 28-year-old daughter, with a protein S activity of 16%, remained asymptomatic, although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography demonstrated engorged veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Protein C activity and APC resistance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> family members were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal analysis of the family members revealed no morphological aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Protein S deficiency</z:e> increases the risk of congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in young and middle-aged heterozygous individuals </plain></SENT>
