<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To improve understanding of the potential mechanisms associated with cerebral microemboli during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery in adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Paradoxical cerebral fat microembolization during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery has been associated with right-to-left shunting through an undetected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defect</z:mpath> in the adult population may be as high as 15% to 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical relevance of this embolic phenomenon during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery has not been investigated, a few reports have documented its fatal consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has been suspected in some patients with postoperative reduced visual function, particularly after complex instrumented fusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bilateral transcranial Doppler (2 MHz) was used to monitor cerebral microemboli in the right and left middle cerebral arteries during spinal instrumentation and fusion in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography incorporating pulse and color Doppler (3.5-5 MHz) and a contrast test was used in these patients to detect atrial shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring detected high rates of cerebral microemboli associated with the presence of an atrial communication in two adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two additional patients with no detected brain microembolization, echocardiographic examination indicated the absence of an atrial shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest that unrecognized atrial communications in adolescents undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery contribute to higher rates of Doppler-detected cerebral microemboli than those found in adolescents without this congenital defect </plain></SENT>
