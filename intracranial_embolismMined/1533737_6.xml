<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate experimental mechanisms of reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e>, we produced transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in five baboons by unilateral perfusion of internal carotid territories with platelet microemboli generated endogenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Platelet microemboli were formed by incorporating segments of Dacron vascular graft for 1 hour as unilateral carotid arterio-arterial shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet embolization was assessed by ultrasonography and isotopic imaging; cerebral function was evaluated by measurements of somatosensory evoked potentials and clinical motor performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Platelet microemboli, detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, accumulated rapidly in the shunted carotid hemispheric territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi>-111-labeled platelets reached a maximum value of 3.2 +/- 0.8 x 10(9) platelets in the dependent hemisphere of five animals after 20 minutes of carotid blood flow through the grafts when measured in real time by continuous scintillation camera imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The retained 111In-platelet microemboli cleared from the cerebral vasculature within 1 hour after removing the grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corresponding blood markers of in vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, and fibrinopeptide A, increased eightfold to 20-fold after incorporating graft segments and normalized within 1 hour after removing the grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coincidently, focal neurological function was temporarily impaired, as shown by the ipsilateral loss of somatosensory evoked potentials 5 minutes after initiating platelet microembolization, with restoration 1 hour after removing the grafts in five baboons, and contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in two recovered baboons, with complete resolution by 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endogenously generated platelet microemboli accumulate transiently in the dependent cerebral circulation and produce corresponding focal neurological dysfunction that resolves within hours after microembolization </plain></SENT>
