<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> were treated with doses of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> varying from 500,000 to 20,000,000 units per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was confirmed in some cases by growths on blood culture, in others by postmortem examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In those cases in which the diagnosis was established by blood culture, the in vitro sensitivity of the organism to <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> was determined and <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> then was administered by continuous intramuscular infusion in a dosage calculated to produce blood levels of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> four to five times that required for in vitro inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">Penicillin</z:chebi> was given for a period of 21 days, and blood cultures were made periodically during and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 57 patients, 38 were cured (66.7 per cent), and 19 died (33.3 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 who died, three did so within 48 hours of hospitalization and seven died despite adequate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these seven, three died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, two because of resistance to <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17076">streptomycin</z:chebi>, one because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and one of undetermined cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining nine who died were considered to have been inadequately treated in that there was (1) failure to obtain sensitivity, (2) inadequate dossage of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi>, (3) delay in starting treatment, or (4) failure to recognize <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mixed infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were five patients with repeatedly <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> blood cultures during life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases, streptococcus viridans was recovered at postmortem examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to determine how long therapy should justly be withheld in patients with repeatedly <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> blood cultures, 140 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> in which positive blood cultures had been obtained were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the review it was determined that if blood cultures taken during the first two days are reported <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp>, the chance of subsequent cultures proving positive is minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, for patients in whom the diagnosis seems otherwise obvious, delaying treatment for more than two days is not justified even though the blood culture be <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In cases in which blood cultures are repeatedly <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp>, a dosage of 6,000,000 to 10,000,000 units of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> daily for 21 days is advisable.High <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> resistance to <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17076">streptomycin</z:chebi> was found in four fatal cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In one of these, the infecting organism was streptococcus viridans, and in three it was staphylococcus albus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was one patient with penumococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> complicated by unrecognized streptococcal viridans <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
