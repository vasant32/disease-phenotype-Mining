<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report deals with a comparative study of these two radiopharmaceuticals for RI cisternography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the past one year 301 RI cisternography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the past one year 301 RI cisternographies were performed in 160 cases at the Neurosurgical Survice of Shizuoka Rosai Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among those 169Yb-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> was used in 137 occasions, 111In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> in 53, and both 169Yb-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> and 111In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> in 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this study were as follow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>111In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> was chemically stable in intrathecal administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> was minimal with 111In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> if any </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no adverse reaction, such as aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, following 111In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> cisternographies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effective half-life of 111In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> was 16 hours, and that of 169Yb-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> 22 hours in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This means the men were exposed to radioactivity less with 111In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> than with 169Yb-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in diagnostic value between these two radiopharmaceuticals, even 48 hours after intrathecal administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>From this study 111In-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> appears to be more suitable for RI cisternography than 169Yb-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
