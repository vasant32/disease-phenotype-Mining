<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can be provided via balloon-tipped catheters or a branched graft sewn to the brachiocephalic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a consecutive series of total arch replacement using a trifurcated graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From September 1999 through October 2004, 109 patients underwent nonemergent total arch replacement using this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The graft, placed during a period of hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, was used for selective cerebral perfusion during the arch reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adverse outcomes were seen in 9 (8.3%) patients: hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 5 (4.6%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 5 (4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient neurologic dysfunction was noted in 6 (5.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was 31.2 +/- 6.6 minutes and selective cerebral perfusion was 65.3 +/- 20.9 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was required in 3 (2.8%) patients and prolonged intubation in 15 (13.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median intensive care unit stay was 3 days (interquartile range 2-4; range, 1 to 108) and hospital stay was 9 (interquartile range 8-15; range, 5 to 108) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The trifurcated graft technique results in low rates of perioperative mortality, temporary neurologic dysfunction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may reduce cerebral embolization as it requires no instrumentation of the aortic arch to establish selective cerebral perfusion and, although it mandates hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> to place the graft, this interval is reliably brief enough to fall within accepted safe limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This strategy leaves no residual arch tissue behind, and allows placement of an elephant trunk proximal to one or more arch vessels if anatomically indicated </plain></SENT>
