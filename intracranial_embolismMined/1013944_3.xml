<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the day following the procedure the dogs showed evidence of neurological damage including impaired consciousness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities largely cleared within a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the animals were sacrificed at intervals after the procedure, the cerebral microvasculature was demonstrated by injecting a suspension a lamp black into the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This revealed that multiple filling defects were present in the microcirculation of the brain immmediately after CPB and for two days thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, by seven days the microvascular blockade had disappeared, and the vascular blockade had disappeared, and the vascular pattern of the brain had returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological findings were sparse and restricted to the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the transient neurological syndromes that sometimes follow cardiopulmonary bypass for heart surgery may be due to a transient microvascular blockade, perhaps by microbubbles and microparticles </plain></SENT>
