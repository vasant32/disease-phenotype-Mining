<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It was determined from in vitro experiments that the minimal dose of urokinase required to lyse 10 ml of clotted canine blood within a closed space must exceed 10,000 IU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We empirically doubled this minimum effective dose and tested the in vivo safety of injecting 20,000 IU of urokinase every 12 hours for 4 days into the ventricles of six adult mongrel dogs through an implanted catheter-reservoir system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were monitored carefully for local and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> by neurological and clinical examination, hematological tests reflecting systemic fibrinolytic status, serial computed tomography, and postmortem histological examinations of the brain, meninges, and peripheral organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that this intraventricular dose regimen of urokinase did not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> even though the dogs had recent brain wounds related to transcerebral ventricular catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mild activation of systemic fibrinolysis, implying passage of the enzyme from ventricle to blood, occurred 4 to 6 hours after each intraventricular injection, but no systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This dose regimen also did not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory changes in the brain or meninges and did not disturb cerebrospinal fluid circulation </plain></SENT>
