<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler studies have suggested that microemboli are released into the arterial circulation during the majority of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This, together with the observation that neuropsychological performance may decline postoperatively, has led to concern that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> may occur unrecognized during CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to examine this risk with diffusion-weighted imaging, a technique that is highly sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen participants (median age, 68 years; age range, 56-87 years) were assessed with diffusion-weighted imaging and the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale before and after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed using single-shot echo-planar imaging with a maximum diffusion sensitivity of b = 1000 s/mm(2) applied to three orthogonal planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative imaging was performed a median of 2.5 hours before surgery (range, 0.5-12.5 hours) and 15 hours after surgery (range, 1.5-58.5 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two neuroradiologists independently interpreted the diffusion-weighted images, blinded to operative status and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no diffusion-weighted imaging evidence of silent embolism in this series of 18 participants (95% confidence interval limits, 0 to 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical complications were confined to one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> occurring after CEA; the diffusion-weighted imaging results were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no evidence from our series that silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> is a common occurrence during CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data provide further support for the safety of CEA </plain></SENT>
