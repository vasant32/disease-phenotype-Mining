<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S-100beta protein could be used to evaluate cerebral injury and to predict outcome in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and severe septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: In 170 consecutively enrolled patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and septic shock, serum S-100beta and NSE were measured daily during four consecutive days after intensive care unit admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Admission Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale before sedation and daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were recorded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006846'>Acute encephalopathy</z:hpo> was defined as either a state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> (type A) or characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo>, stupor, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> (type B) and persistently observed during 72 hrs after withdrawing sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When clinically indicated, contrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were performed to evaluate brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: S-100beta and NSE increased in, respectively, 72 (42%) and 90 (53%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High biomarker levels were associated with the maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (p = .001), and the highest values were found in patients who died early, within 4 days of inclusion (p = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low consciousness <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> type B was more frequently observed in patients with elevated S-100beta (p = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>S-100beta levels of &gt;or=4 microg/L were associated with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and values of &lt;2 microg/L were found in patients with diffuse cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High S-100beta levels were associated with higher intensive care unit mortality (p = .04) and represented the strongest independent predictor of intensive care unit survival, whereas NSE and the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale failed to predict fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: S-100beta and NSE are frequently increased and associated with brain injury in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>S-100beta levels more closely reflected severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> than NSE and the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
