<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelet studies included platelet aggregation induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and ristocetin, spontaneous platelet aggregation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (VIII:vWF), platelet aggregation enhancing factor (PAEF), and percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011877'>large platelets</z:hpo> (megathrombocytes) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with cardiogenic embolism, however, these studies were negative except for percent megathrombocytes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increase in platelet aggregation to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and percent megathrombocytes developed slowly over a week following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
