<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controversy exists with regard to the prognostic significance of early computed tomography (CT) changes in patients receiving rt-PA for AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors retrospectively reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of AIS who received intravenous rt-PA for AIS in University of South Alabama hospitals between January 1996 and May 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A neuroradiologist, blinded to clinical outcomes, reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> baseline CT scans for the presence of the following signs: hyperdense middle cerebral artery (HMCA), loss of gray-white differentiation (LGWD), insular ribbon sign (IRS), parenchymal hypodensity (PH), and sulcal effacement (SE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was recorded 90 days after thrombolysis, and clinical outcome was dichotomized as favorable (0-1) or unfavorable (2-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors performed both univariate and multivariate analyses to investigate the relationship between early CT signs, baseline clinical variables, and functional outcome as measured by the 90-day mRS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Any one early CT finding was detected in 23(64%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of specific findings were as follows: SE in 13 patients (36%), LGWD in 12 patients (33%), PH in 9 patients (25%), HMCA in 4 patients (11%), and IRS in 3 patients (8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant association between the occurrence of these imaging findings and subsequent functional outcome after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the presence of subtle <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CT changes in AIS patients is not predictive of clinical outcome following administration of rt-PA as per National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> protocol </plain></SENT>
