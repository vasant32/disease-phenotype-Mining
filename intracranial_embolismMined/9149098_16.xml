<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were detected in the entire cerebral cortex on the lesioned side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> accumulation was observed only adjacent and peripheral to the site of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 1 h after photothrombotic injury, Hsp70 expression delineates the area of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> at 24 h after photothrombotic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hsp27 protein was observed in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex with the exception of the deep layers of the cingulate cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, while c-Fos immunoreactivity was localized in cell nuclei, Hsp27 immunoreactivity was detected in the cytoplasm of astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that unilateral cortical injury induces changes in gene expression that vary according to cell type and brain region </plain></SENT>
