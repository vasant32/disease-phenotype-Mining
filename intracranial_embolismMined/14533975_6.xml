<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of the FilterWire EX for the capture and removal of debris and prevention of embolic events during endovascular carotid interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the period from October 2001 to May 2002, 100 patients (60 men; mean age 72 years, range 48-90), 69 symptomatic with &gt;or=50% internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and 31 asymptomatic with &gt;or=70% stenosis were scheduled for carotid stenting with cerebral protection provided by the FilterWire EX system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory performance of the filter was defined as effectiveness in preventing intraprocedural embolic events shown by visible debris in the filter and unchanged neurological status assessed by an independent neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The placement and retrieval of the FilterWire EX was technically successful in 93 of 100 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five delivery failures were due to severe ICA angulation; one stenosis was underestimated on preprocedural imaging, and one case was aborted following a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during sheath manipulation before filter introduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 56.9% of the protected cases, the filter contained debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One neurological event occurred 6 hours after the procedure: a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> from which the patient recovered fully after 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other procedure-related events were recorded within 30 days of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The procedural success among the 93 patients stented under FilterWire EX protection was 98% (92% by intention to treat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The FilterWire EX appears to be an effective tool in the prevention of embolic events and in preserving neurological status during endovascular treatment of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
