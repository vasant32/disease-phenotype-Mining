<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an investigation of the role of platelets in vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in cats, direct observation of the cortex revealed that within several minutes after cold injury, platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> formed in small veins at the point where the veins emerged from the depths of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Later, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> fluid extravasated from the veins at this same point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with a platelet inhibitor, RA-233, abolished the formation of platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and remarkably enhanced the leakage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The microcirculation was assessed by carbon black perfusion and was found to fill better in the cats that received the platelet inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The better filling may be ascribed to a decreased number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and consequent improved blood flow in small blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that platelet aggregates play a major role in controlling the leakage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> fluid after cold injury </plain></SENT>
