<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of microembolization in LVAD-patients is still not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether systemic markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or pump dynamic correlate with cerebral microembolization in nine patients with DeBakey LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed transcranial Doppler (TCD) for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-detection and evaluated parameters of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (i.e. Leukocytes, CRP, Fibrinogen) and pump dynamic (i.e. power, speed, flow) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean LVAD duration of 203.7 +/- 179 days, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> occurred in five patients with an incidence of 0.38% (approximately 0.38 events/100 LVAD-days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed 290 TCD monitorings with a <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> mean count of 50.4 +/- 346 signals/hour (0-5042) and prevalence of 42.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no association between individual microembolic activity and the markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or pump dynamic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with DeBakey LVAD, a high load of clinically silent cerebral microemboli can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there is no correlation between markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or pump dynamic and the individual amount of microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that a gaseous nature of the majority of detected microemboli in the DeBakey LVAD may be the underlying reason for this discrepancy </plain></SENT>
