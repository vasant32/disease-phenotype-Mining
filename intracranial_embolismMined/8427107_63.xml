<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: 1) To describe the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> atherothrombotic and embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 2) to study the variables of the occlusion site as seen on the angiograms, the CT signs of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS), and the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> as seen on the 24-hour CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-three of 139 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial disease and the effects of treatment were assessed with both CT and cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization of occluded arteries occurred in 32 patients and was more frequent in distal occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, patients displaying recanalization tended to develop small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and patients with a HMCAS tended to develop large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with signs of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> developed large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of a HMCAS was 100% fic for an occluded artery, but only 27% sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic transformations occurred in the distribution of the occluded arteries in 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Emergency cerebral angiography, which can be carried out relatively safely, adds important information about the nature and extent of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp>, and the recanalization efficacy of fibrinolytic therapy for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolytic therapy can be carried out with a relatively low complication rate that still needs to be correlated with the clinical benefits of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolytic therapy in the doses utilized in this study, is more effective with distal than with proximal carotid territory occlusions </plain></SENT>
