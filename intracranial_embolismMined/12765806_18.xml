<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and the low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, dalteparin, are used for prophylaxis against venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in patients undergoing craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These drugs were compared in a randomized, prospective pilot study comparing intermittent pneumatic compression devices plus dalteparin to intermittent pneumatic compression devices plus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred patients undergoing craniotomy were randomly allocated to receive perioperative prophylaxis with subcutaneous (SC <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, 5000 units every 12 hours, or dalteparin, 2,500 units once a day, begun at induction of anesthesia and continued for 7 days or until the patient was ambulating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Entry criteria were age over 18 years, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) preoperatively as judged by lower limb duplex ultrasound and no clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with hypersensitivity to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, penetrating head injury or who refused informed consent were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a duplex study 1 week after surgery and 1 month clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with lower limb intermittent pneumatic compression devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences between groups in age, gender, and risk factors for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between groups in intraoperative blood loss, transfusion requirements or postoperative platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients receiving dalteparin developed DVT (one symptomatic and one asymptomatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> developed DVT and no patient in either group developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were two <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> that did not require repeat craniotomy in patients receiving dalteparin and one that did require surgical evacuation in a patient treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Drug was stopped in two patients treated with dalteparin because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of these differences were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> between <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and dalteparin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that, given the small sample size of this trial, both drugs appear to be safe and the incidence of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> by postoperative screening duplex ultrasound appears to be low when these agents are used in combination with intermittent pneumatic compression devices </plain></SENT>
