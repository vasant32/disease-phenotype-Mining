<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three cases of large cerebral arteriovenous fistulae are presented in which surgical ablation was complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> from hyperperfusion breakthrough believed to be caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intraoperative hypoperfusion superimposed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> preoperative hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these cases, experimental data, and theoretical considerations, we seriously question the wisdom of using staged surgical resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002408'>cerebral arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> to prevent complications related to alterations in cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this concern are: the repeated occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-on-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion during staged resection; a lack of understanding of the time course for the correction of a disordered autoregulation; risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> between the initial and final resection; difficulty in assessing and substantiating flow reduction after subtotal resection; the rapidity of collateralization; the divergence of flow from large, readily accessible feeding arteries to deep penetrating vessels; and attenuation of the wall thickness in collateral vessels as a consequence of increased flow </plain></SENT>
