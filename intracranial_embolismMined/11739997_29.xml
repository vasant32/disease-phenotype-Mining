<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS-519</z:chebi> blocks activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, a major mediator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that combination treatment of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rhtPA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS-519</z:chebi> extends the therapeutic window for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with rhtPA without increasing incidence of hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) of male Wistar rats (n=56) was occluded by an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After embolization, animals were randomly divided into the following groups: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS-519</z:chebi> treatment groups: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS-519</z:chebi> was given at 2, 4, or 6 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; rhtPA treatment groups: rhtPA was given at 2 or 4 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; combination treatment groups: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS-519</z:chebi> and rhtPA were given at 2, 4, or 6 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; control group: the same volume of saline was given at 2 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS-519</z:chebi> alone at 2 or 4 hours, but not 6 hours, significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological recovery compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of rhtPA alone at 2 hours, but not 4 hours, significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological recovery compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, combination treatment with rhtPA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS-519</z:chebi> even at 6 hours significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, improved neurological recovery, and did not increase the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation compared with the control group or the group treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS-519</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that combination treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52724">PS-519</z:chebi> and rhtPA extends the neuroprotective effect to at least 6 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
