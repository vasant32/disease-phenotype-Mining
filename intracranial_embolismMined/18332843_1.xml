<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Papillary fibroelastoma</z:e> is the most common primary cardiac valvular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Historically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">papillary fibroelastoma</z:e> was an incidental autopsy finding, deemed to have no clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, reports of symptomatic cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">papillary fibroelastoma</z:e> with complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> suggest it should be considered a potentially dangerous lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe the clinical and echocardiographic findings of 3 patients with cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">papillary fibroelastoma</z:e> who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebral vascular events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and echocardiographic findings of 3 patients with cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">papillary fibroelastoma</z:e> (CPF) who presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebral vascular events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Describe the findings of 3 patients and review of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report 3 cases with cerebral ischemic events associated with the presence of CPF that were confirmed by histopathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiogenic embolism is recognized increasingly as an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, accounting of 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is largely preventable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of recurrence is relatively high for most cardioembolic sources and therefore secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention is fundamental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TEE allowed to characterize well-established sources of embolism, and it was the best diagnostic approach in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was used in 1 of these patients, while it confirmed the presumptive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The first-choice treatment of symptomatic CPF is surgical excision which must be performed as early as possible to reduce the risk of early recurrences of embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The use of TEE in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebral vascular events</z:hpo> is not routinely performed, this method must be considered in patients for whom the cause of cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is unclear, after noninvasive neurovascular studies </plain></SENT>
