<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential of this technique in assessing embolic risk and selecting patients for surgery was examined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selected patients with symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> underwent combined extracranial and transcranial Doppler study in the Vascular Surgery and Neurovascular Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were monitored with transcranial Doppler over both middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> was diagnosed with colour Duplex ultrasound examination or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selected patients underwent cranial computed tomography and transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were re-examined one month after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty symptomatic patients, six asymptomatic patients and 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid disease</z:e> was unilateral in 34 and bilateral in 22 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Emboli signals were detected in 94% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The emboli signal count in patients with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the middle cerebral artery distal to the stenosed internal carotid compared to the contralateral middle cerebral artery [14 (10-22) versus 2 (0-7) signals per hour, median and 95% confidence intervals, p &lt; 0.001] and in symptomatic compared to asymptomatic cerebral hemispheres [15 (11-21) versus 4 (2-9) signals per hour, p &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Emboli were detected in the contralateral middle cerebral artery in 40% of patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e>, in 85% of whom an additional embolic source was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No emboli signals were detected after carotid endarterectomy distal to the operated internal carotid, or in any of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, intracranial emboli signals are common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
