<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inadvertent foreign body embolization is a rarely diagnosed and neglected complication of cerebral angiography that has not been studied systematically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook a comprehensive 5-year retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available postmortem cases of postangiographic neurologic complications, as well as a comprehensive histologic examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surgically resected central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the autopsy series, we found 3 patients for whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, sometimes catastrophic, is attributable to inadvertent cotton fiber, Gelfoam, or polyvinyl alcohol particulate emboli during cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases described had concurrent atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Particulate embolization, which is usually cotton fiber, is present in as many as 25% of resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>: the risk of finding such emboli is in part dependent on a history of prior interventional (as opposed to diagnostic) angiographic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is not surprising that the amount of tissue examined also increases the risk of finding such emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unintentional foreign body emboli remain common in modern angiographic practice and are probably underappreciated clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although such emboli are usually asymptomatic, they can be clinically devastating, and a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Foreign body emboli should be included in the differential diagnosis of postangiographic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or infarction </plain></SENT>
