<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The series consists of 70 female patients (mean age: 61 +/- 5), 25 of whom suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and 45 from thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; 40 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (mean age 43 +/- 5) were also considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each patient after an overnight fasting a withdrawal of venous blood was done within 24-36 hours after the admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each sample the determination of seven prothrombotic markers [(fibrinogen (F), factor VII (F VII), antithrombin III (AT III), protein C (PC), protein S (PS) (coagulometric method IL), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) (ELISA method Boehringer)] and of three prethrombotic markers [(fibrinopeptide A (FPA), beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) and D-dimer (D-D) (ELISA method, Boehringer)] was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results obtained in the group of the cerebrovasculopathic patients compared to the controls showed a significant increase of F (p &lt; 0.001), F VII (p &lt; 0.005), BTG (p &lt; 0.05) and D-D (p &lt; 0.01), whereas significant differences regarding AT III, PC, PS, t-PA, PAI and FPA were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that the increased levels of fibrinogen and factor VII in the cerebrovascular subjects, globally considered, may depend on a marked prothrombotic state, linked in a pathogenetic sense to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>; the existence of a prethrombotic state is also documented by the increase of betathromboglobulin and D-dimer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
