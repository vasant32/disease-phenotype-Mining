<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few data are available about its characteristics during the 2 different kinds of procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the incidence of microemboli occurring during angioplasty alone with that during stenting in the different phases of the procedures and to relate it to periprocedural cerebrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients underwent 41 procedures (15 angioplasty alone and 26 stenting) for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> of 70% or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring was performed to detect microemboli in the middle cerebral artery during 3 phases of the procedure: (1) guidewire crossing, (2) first <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in case of angioplasty alone or stent release with predilatation if performed, and (3) further <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microemboli occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in phase 1 of the procedure but less frequently in the arteries treated with stenting when compared with those treated with angioplasty alone in phase 2 and particularly (P&lt;.02) in phase 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean number of microemboli was highest in phase 2, predominant (P&lt;.05) during angioplasty alone, and particularly reduced (P&lt;.02) in phase 3 during the stenting procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 2 (5%) of the 41 procedures, cerebrovascular complications occurred in phase 1, with the number of microemboli being higher than mean values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral microembolism is a very common event, especially during guidewire crossing and angioplasty alone compared with stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies concerning the prognostic significance of this are advisable </plain></SENT>
