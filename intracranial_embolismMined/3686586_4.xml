<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of the photosensitizing dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and intense focal illumination of the brain produced a deep cortical infarction that resulted from singlet oxygen-induced peroxidative injury to the endothelial membrane, subsequent platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and eventual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was calculated from area measurements on consecutive histologic sections prepared from the brain cortex 4 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral treatment with 40 mg/kg flunarizine 3 hours before photoexcitation resulted in a significant reduction of the median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size from 11.75 mm3 in the untreated group to 6.40 mm3 in the treated group (n = 13, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At this dose, flunarizine had no effect on systemic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a separate experiment the area of thrombotic obstruction was quantified 30 minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of light exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flunarizine did not significantly reduce early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation (2.28 mm3 in the untreated and 1.78 mm3 in the treated group) (n = 12, p = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The infarcted area at 4 hours was considerably larger than the initial thrombotic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protection with flunarizine against development of cortical infarction has been unequivocally shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although some effect may already be present at the early stage of lesion formation, the major protective action admittedly occurred in the later postinsult period when the lesion was expanding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
