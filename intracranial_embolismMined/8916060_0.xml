<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No direct comparisons in a cross-over design of the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> and aspirin on asymptomatic circulating cerebral microemboli are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated 53 patients with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients were dosed for 2 weeks, 300 mg aspirin once daily and then for 2 weeks, 250 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 27 other patients the scheme was reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring (both middle cerebral arteries simultaneously for 1 h were performed at the end of the two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The signal was recorded on digitalised audio tapes and analyzed blinded off-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of embolic signals per hour and vessel was 15.7 under aspirin and 11.7 under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> (difference not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the number of emboli under the two medications was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest number of embolic signals was found in high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with a low number of embolic signals, reproducibility was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A minimum of 7 embolic signals in one treatment group is required for further therapeutic drug trials to allow reasonable comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study may help to plan further therapeutic trials using emboli detection </plain></SENT>
