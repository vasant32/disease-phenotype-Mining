<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with LAT or SCE are at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between SCE detected with TEE [5MHz] and coagulation and fibrinolysis factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We took blood samples from 83 patients to measure plasma levels of TAT, PIC, D-dimer, fibrinogen and thrombomodulin (TM) just before TEE examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into four groups according to SCE grade based on echo density and area of the left atrium occupied by SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma TAT and D-dimer were higher in the high grade SCE group than in the lower SCE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma TM was lower in the high grade SCE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these results, high grade SCE detected by TEE correlates with activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
