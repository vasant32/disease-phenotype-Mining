<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated prospectively <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients aged 50 years or below who were admitted with the diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to the University Hospital "Marqu√©s de Valdecilla" from April 1, 1986, to March 31, 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the main hospital of the region to which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with neurological problems are referred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients underwent a complete clinical and laboratory assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and had 1-year mean follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total series included 81 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual age-specific crude incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were 17.3 and 10.4 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (30%) were diagnosed as having nonembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, 14 (17%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262004" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic cerebral infarction</z:e>, 20 (25%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 22 (27%) spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and one case (1%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (22%) died within 30 days of the cerebrovascular event, and two others died during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine percent of the survivors recovered and were completely self-sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the young found in Cantabria is comparable with that in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The initial hospital mortality was not negligible, but the prognosis among the survivors was favorable </plain></SENT>
