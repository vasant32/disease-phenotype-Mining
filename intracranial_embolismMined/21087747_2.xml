<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the rate of periprocedural embolic ischemic brain injury during transapical aortic valve replacement in 25 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is rapidly being established as a new therapeutic approach for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although initial clinical results are promising, it is unknown whether mobilization and embolization of calcified particles may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients (10 men, 15 women, mean age: 81 ± 5 years, mean log EuroSCORE [European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation]: 32 ± 10%) scheduled for transapical aortic valve implantation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a baseline cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The scan was repeated approximately 6 days after valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The magnetic resonance imaging studies included axial diffusion-weighted, T(2)-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery-weighted, and T(2) gradient echo sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Standardized assessment of the neurologic status was performed before aortic valve replacement and post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transapical aortic valve implantation was successfully performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients (68%), new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> could be detected, whereas 8 patients showed no new cerebral insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pattern of distribution and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were typical of embolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the high incidence of morphologically detectable lesions, only 5 patients showed clinical neurologic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Out of these patients, only 1 suffered from a permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: New embolic ischemic cerebral insults are detected in 68% of patients after transapical valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms are rare and usually transitory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Larger trials will need to establish the clinical significance of asymptomatic ischemic lesions as well as the rate of ischemic events in patients undergoing transfemoral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
