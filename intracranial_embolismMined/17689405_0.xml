<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>Sleep apnea</z:hpo> leads to frequent episodes of nocturnal hypoxemia and may induce ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Snoring and daytime sleepiness are cardinal symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to determine differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and early neurologic course in patients at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> as determined by a sleep questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> completed the Berlin questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Berlin questionnaire examines habitual snoring, daytime sleepiness, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and body mass index (BMI) and classifies patients into a high or low risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score was determined on admission and day 5 of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, BMI, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism were determined prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We enrolled 190 patients with a mean age of 60 years and 53% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Berlin questionnaire classified 103 patients (54%) at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median NIHSS score on admission and day 5 of hospitalization did not differ between the two groups after multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Examined separately, we found no effect of snoring, daytime sleepiness, or BMI on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that a large number of patients admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were at high risk for having <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We were not able to show that a constellation of symptoms and features highly suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> influenced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity or early neurologic course after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
