<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those of 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic occlusion of the same artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial thrombolysis was performed in 10 patients and thrombolysis combined with <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> in 5 in whom symptoms reappeared due to restenosis or reocclusion, or in whom recanalisation was not successfully accomplished by thrombolysis alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients with embolism recanalisation was observed in 28 (93 %) and there was no patient with reocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> recanalisation immediately after thrombolysis alone was observed in 9 of 15 (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Restenosis, with reappearance of symptoms, occurred in 2 of these (22 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patients who also underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, angiography after 1 month did not demonstrate any restenosis or reocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis combined with <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may provide an effective procedure for restoring patency and preventing reocclusion of the occluded artery </plain></SENT>
