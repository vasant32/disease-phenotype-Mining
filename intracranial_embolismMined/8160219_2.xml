<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of uncertain etiology were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were divided into the following three groups: 13 patients with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (group A), 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (group B), and 6 asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of obvious etiology (group D) and 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy volunteers (group E) were also studied as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients transcranial Doppler sonography and contrast echocardiography were recorded simultaneously after intravenous injection of the contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings of positive patient foramen ovale in contrast echocardiography or "chirp" sounds in transcranial Doppler sonography were defined as positive for paradoxical contrast embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radioisotope phlebography of the lower extremities and pulmonary scintigraphy, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33371">technetium-99</z:chebi> macroaggregated albumin, were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 patients who had positive findings of paradoxical contrast embolization and in 12 patients whose findings were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive findings of paradoxical contrast embolization were found in 17 subjects by transcranial Doppler sonography but in only 8 on contrast echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These positive findings were detected more frequently in group A (77%) than in groups B, D, and E (9%, 18%, and 9%, respectively) (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group C, 4 of 6 patients (67%) had positive findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were positive findings on both phlebography and pulmonary scintigraphy only in 6 group A patients, with positive findings of paradoxical contrast embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial Doppler sonography is a sensitive detector of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Paradoxical cerebral embolization might be frequent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of unknown etiology, especially when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
