<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cognitive effects of these embolic events are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive change</z:e> after primary cemented hip arthroplasty using a range of neuropsychological tests and to measure intraoperative cerebral embolic load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty primary cemented total hip arthroplasties underwent a series of cognitive tests before and at four days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A range of validated tests assessed: global cognitive function; verbal fluency and speed; immediate and delayed memory recall; attention and mental processing speeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intra-operative transcranial Doppler ultrasound monitoring of the middle cerebral artery for embolic signals was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared median cognitive results post-pre surgery and a Mann-Whitney U test established if there was a cognitive difference between those patients who had detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Scatter plot graphs were also used to establish any correlation between the embolic load and clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant (p&lt;0.01) difference was noted in specific tests assessing mental processing speed, visual searching and sustained and divided attention following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intra-operative cerebral embolic signals were detected in 11 out of 20 patients and the majority occurred with femoral component cementation and hip reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> between those patients who had detectable cerebral embolic signals and those who did not and there appeared to be no direct correlation between the size of the embolic load and the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
