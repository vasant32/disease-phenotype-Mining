<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In embolic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) trunk occlusion, recanalization with direct percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) may be preferable to time-consuming thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, distal embolization with small crushed fragments is a complication of direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated combined direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and low-dose native tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients underwent direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was successfully crushed in 12, who received subsequent native t-PA infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was performed with a balloon catheter, which was advanced into the occlusion site and inflated several times until recanalization was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, 7.2 mg of native t-PA in 100 mL of isotonic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> solution was infused for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic status was evaluated at admission and immediately and 1 month after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, follow-up CT was performed within 24 hours and 3-7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> failed to crush the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in three of 15 patients; these three had no clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 11 of 12 patients, combined therapy was successful, with no technical complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although no symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred, one patient had a small <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with successful recanalization had marked clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although angiograms showed distal embolizations in 10, cortical infarctions were confirmed in only three at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined direct <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and IV low-dose native t-PA therapy may be a safe alternative to thrombolytic therapy in some patients with embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk occlusion </plain></SENT>
