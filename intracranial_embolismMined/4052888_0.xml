<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The morphologic data available suggests that the siphon plays only a small role in embolic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies, however, suggest that it has a significant ischemic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify this apparent discrepancy, we have designed a scanning electron microscope study of the carotid siphon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of the specimens from the carotid bifurcation and 30% of the siphon specimens showed evidence of damaged endothelium with attached red cell and platelet debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The embolic potential of the siphon is estimated to be between 1/3 to 1/2 that of the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This supports the most recent clinical studies </plain></SENT>
