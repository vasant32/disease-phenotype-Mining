<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> (AAA) is a common cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) shows not only the extension of atherosclerotic plaques but also the mobility of superimposed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most cases AAA is only detected after the embolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was therefore designed to identify predictive factors for AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seven consecutive patients referred for routine TEE were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy, with a history of recent surgery, or with any signs of infectious, immunological, or malignant diseases were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> carried the highest risk for AAA (odds ratio, 3.0), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (2.5) and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age &gt;70 years was accompanied with a 1.8-fold increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010522'>aortic calcifications</z:mp> on standard chest x-ray had a 4.6-fold higher prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe AAA was associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein (14.6+/-14.1 versus 4.9+/-7.2 mg/L), fibrinogen (4.20+/-1.22 versus 3.45+/-1.29 mg/L), plasmin/antiplasmin complexes (728+/-297 versus 453+/-243 microg/L), and D-dimers (980+/-652 versus 444+/-349 microg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AAA is accompanied by elevation of inflammatory and hemostatic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0010522'>aortic calcifications</z:mp> on chest x-ray have a higher prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are now warranted to establish a risk score to identify patients in whom TEE screening should be undertaken </plain></SENT>
