<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In this article we will review some of the issues surrounding the relationship between TCD-detected emboli and brain function and architecture, both during conventional surgical carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In both procedures, the cerebral embolic load was semi quantitatively assessed and associated with clinical outcome during the procedure and after a symptom free interval within 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In CEA, particulate emboli that occurred during the wound closure stage were associated with intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, odds ratios [OR] 2.3 95% CI 1.2-4.4, p = 0.007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In CAS, showers of microemboli that appeared at postdilatation of the stent (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.5-6.9, p = 0.002), particulate macroembolism (relative risk [RR] 10.2, 95% CI 5.9-17.3, p &lt; 0.001), and massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> (RR 10.2, 95%CI 5.8-17.7, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with new transient and persistent cerebral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In both CEA and CAS, recording of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> by TCD ultrasonography provides insight in the pathogenesis of procedure related adverse cerebral outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In several centres TCD monitoring during CEA is now accepted as a clinically relevant tool that helps the surgeon to make the operation safer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In CAS more research is needed, particularly with respect to the impact of cerebral protection devices </plain></SENT>
