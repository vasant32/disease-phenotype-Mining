<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical and haemodynamic findings in these 16 patients are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> appeared late in the course of the disease, and its occurrence did not seem to be related to the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular outflow obstruction</z:e> or to the amount of associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each patient the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was accompanied by severe clinical deterioration, which often necessitated urgent medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Digitalis was administered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 patients with subsequent clinical improvement in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrical cardioversion was uniformly successful in restoring sinus rhythm, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> usually recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In each of 8 patients catheterized during <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, cardiac output was strikingly low (average, 1.9 l./min./m.(2)), whereas it was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 10 of 13 patients studied in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The duration of follow-up from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has averaged 5 years, and 3 of the 16 patients have died of causes related to their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four have suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 5 patients are now in stable sinus rhythm; in general, they are less symptomatic than the patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has recurred.The unusually severe clinical deterioration at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and the low cardiac output measured during catheterization are thought to be related to the loss of the important contribution to ventricular filling of atrial systole in patients with poorly compliant ventricles, and to the effect of an irregular ventricular rhythm on the variable nature of the outflow obstruction </plain></SENT>
