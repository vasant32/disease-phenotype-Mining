<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cranial blood flow (BF) and the remaining 46 had subnormal cranial BF, determined by the intravenous RISA method at the time of the original attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a 7-year follow up, 7 patients (22.6%) of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cranial BF group died; 3 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the remaining 4 from other causes, while 24 patients (52.2%) of the subnormal cranial BF group died; 13 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the remaining 11 of various diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative survival rate was consistently lower in the subnormal cranial BF group than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This difference reached statistical significance at 5 and 7 years of follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence did not differ significantly between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a decreased cranial BF is an indicator of a poor long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
