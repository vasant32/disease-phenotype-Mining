<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are few studies of the impact of TEE on the medical management of patients with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The records of 52 consecutive, hospitalized patients undergoing both TEE and transthoracic echocardiography for suspected cardiac source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> were reviewed to determine the influence of TEE on the decision to anticoagulate patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 52 patients, 39 had focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, n = 9; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 of these 39 patients (10%), the TEE results changed the management of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 19 of 39 patients (49%), the TEE results helped confirm anticoagulation decisions, and in 16 (41%), the results had no effect on anticoagulation decisions, because of overriding clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten of the latter 16 patients had TEE evidence for a possible source of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, but were not anticoagulated; 5 of these were poor candidates for long-term anticoagulation, and the others had right-to-left shunting across a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> or an interatrial septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical variables (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, TEE findings and pre-TEE anticoagulation status) were considered as possible predictors of post-TEE anticoagulation status using logistic regression analysis; the strongest predictor of post-TEE anticoagulation status was pre-TEE anticoagulation status (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the selection of patients presumed to receive maximal benefit from TEE, this study suggests that TEE findings are not predictive of subsequent anticoagulation management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, TEE is at least confirmatory of anticoagulation decisions in most cases </plain></SENT>
