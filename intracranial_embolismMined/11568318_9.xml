<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine possible differences between the evolution of cerebral watershed infarction (WI) and that of territorial thromboembolic infarction (TI) by using diffusion-weighted (DW) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with TI and nine with WI underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infarction stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps were derived from DW images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue signal intensity ratios on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps (rADC), echo-planar T2-weighted images, and DW images were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> infarction stages were measured on DW images, and final lesion volumes were estimated on fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in temporal evolution patterns of rADC between WI and TI (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>rADC pseudonormalization following TI began about 10 days after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, but that following WI did not occur until about 1 month after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Pearson correlation coefficient between final and initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes was 0.9899 for both infarction subtypes, indicating that the initial ischemic injury volume measured at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage predicted the final lesion volume fairly well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The evolution time of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> is faster for TI than for WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference, which likely originates from the different pathophysiologic and hemodynamic features of the two infarction types, might account for the relatively large range of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values reported for the time course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
