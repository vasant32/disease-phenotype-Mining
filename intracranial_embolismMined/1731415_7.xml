<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The benefits and safety of thrombolytic therapy was studied in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We intravenously administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (20-30 MU for 1 hour) to 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (less than 6 hours) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> and examined the neurological outcomes in relation to the findings on computed tomography and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The symptoms ameliorated in four patients within 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and reopening of the occluded arteries occurred in two of the patients immediately after recombinant tissue plasminogen activator infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the initial computed tomographic scan (less than 3 hours), four patients had already demonstrated early indications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, that is, an obscure margin of the lentiform nuclei, reduced tissue attenuation, or effacement of cortical sulci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients failed to demonstrate reopening of the occluded arteries, and one developed a massive brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> with clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining six patients, two obtained clinical improvement with recanalization soon after the therapy and demonstrated little to slight hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcomes at 1 month were favorable in five patients and poor in three; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator may be safe and effective when there are no early computed tomographic findings within 3 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
