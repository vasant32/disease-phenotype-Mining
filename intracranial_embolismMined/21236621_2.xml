<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a major cause of morbidity in aortic and cardiac interventional procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although cerebral embolic protection devices have been developed for carotid interventions and for open heart surgery, a percutaneous device for cerebral embolic protection during aortic and cardiac interventions would be desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Embrella Embolic Deflector (Embrella Cardiovascular Inc, Wayne, Pa) is a percutaneously placed embolic protection device, inserted by a 6F access in the pig's right forelimb, and deployed in the aorta, covering the brachiocephalic vessel origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The device functions by deflecting embolic debris downstream in the aortic circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A swine model (n = 3) was developed for testing the deployment, retrieval, and efficacy of the device using a carotid filtration circuit for collection of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human atheromatous material was prepared as embolization particles with diameters between 150 and 600 Î¼m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deflection efficiency of the device was calculated by comparing numbers of embolic particles in the carotid circulation during protected and unprotected injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The device was reliably deployed, positioned, and retrieved (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant drop in blood pressure across the membrane of the device to suggest reduction of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The device did not become occluded by embolic debris despite an embolic load many times that encountered in the clinical situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Particles entering the carotid circulation after aortic injection of emboli were reduced from 19% of total (unprotected) to 1.3% (protected, P &lt; .0001), with 98.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> injected particles being deflected downstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of arterial injury related to the device found at necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Embrella Embolic Deflector performs safely and reliably in the swine model of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It effectively deflects almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> emboli downstream, away from the carotid circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The deflector shows promise as an aortic embolic protection device and merits further investigation </plain></SENT>
