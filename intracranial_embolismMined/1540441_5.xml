<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the value of transarterial balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the mitral valve for treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> over a period of five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Analysis of patients' functional state, and haemodynamic and echocardiographic variables, before and immediately after the procedure and during a follow up of up to five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A cardiovascular centre in Belgrade, Yugoslavia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Two hundred and ninety four patients who underwent percutaneous transarterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the mitral valve between February 1985 and February 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean mitral valve area was enlarged by 109% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (0.7%), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> (2.3%), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> (9.9%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (2%), and injury to the femoral artery (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two more patients died at two and 11 months after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late cardiac surgery was needed in eight patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> in three, restenosis in three, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in one, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restenosis occurred in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of these underwent repeat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and three had surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvement of symptoms was seen in 94% of patients during the follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transarterial balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the mitral valve gave good results with acceptable morbidity and mortality and had some advantages over the anterograde approach </plain></SENT>
