<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated 3-dimensional T1-weighted gradient echo (3D T1GRE) sequence to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> related to CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed quantitative analyses of the characteristics of 47 carotid plaques before CAS by measuring the signal intensity ratio (SIR) and plaque volume using 3D T1GRE images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used T1-weighted turbo field echo sequence to obtain 3D T1GRE images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated diffusion-weighted images (DWI) of the brain before and after CAS to detect ischemic lesions (DWI lesions) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SIR (2.17 [interquartile range 1.50-3.07] versus 1.35 [interquartile range 1.08-1.97]; P=0.010) and plaque volume (456 mm(3) [interquartile range 256-696] versus 301 mm(3) [interquartile range 126-433]; P=0.008) were significantly higher in the group of patients positive for DWI lesions (P-group: n=26) than DWI lesion-negative patients (N-group: n=21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, SIR (P=0.007) and plaque volume (P=0.042) were independent predictors of DWI lesions with CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SIR (rs=0.42, P=0.005) and plaque volume (rs=0.36, P=0.012) were positively correlated with the number of DWI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From analysis of a receiver-operating characteristic curve, the most reliable cutoff values of SIR and plaque volume to predict DWI lesions related to CAS were 1.80 and 373 mm(3), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative evaluation of carotid plaques using 3D T1GRE images may be useful in predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> related to CAS </plain></SENT>
