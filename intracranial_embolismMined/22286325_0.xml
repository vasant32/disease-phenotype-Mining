<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is associated with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that often result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effective in reducing these events, anticoagulation has several limitations and has been widely underutilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over 90% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> identified in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> without valvular disease originate in the left atrial appendage, whose occlusion is investigated as an alternative to anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of percutaneous occlusion of the left atrial appendage in patients at high risk of embolic events and limitations to the use of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report our initial experience with Amplatzer Cardiac Plugâ„¢ (St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical Inc., Saint Paul, Estados Unidos) in patients with nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We selected patients at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, contraindications to the use or major instability in response to the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The procedures were performed percutaneously under general anesthesia and transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the presence of periprocedural complications and follow-up program included clinical and echocardiographic review within 30 days and by telephone contact after nine months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results: In five selected patients it was possible to occlude the left atrial appendage without periprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no clinical events in follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Controlled clinical trials are needed before percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage should be considered an alternative to anticoagulation in nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>But the device has shown to be promissory in patients at high risk of embolism and restrictions on the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
