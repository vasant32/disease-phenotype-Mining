<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring in carotid endarterectomy has demonstrated embolic signals during this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used this technique in patients undergoing carotid angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was used to monitor for embolic signals in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery before and during 10 technically successful carotid angioplasties and at various standardized times in the following month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the month before angioplasty asymptomatic embolic signals were detected in 3 of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During angioplasty multiple embolic signals were detected immediately after balloon inflation in 9 of 10 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A minor ipsilateral cerebral ischemic event occurred in 1 of these 9, but the other 8 were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals were common immediately after the procedure and intra-arterial femoral catheter removal (8 of 10 subjects) but thereafter became less frequent and were present in 1 of 5 at 4 hours, 2 of 10 at 48 hours, 1 of 6 at 7 days, and 1 of 10 at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Embolization at the time of carotid angioplasty is very common but usually asymptomatic; monitoring by means of Doppler ultrasound will allow the effectiveness of measures to reduce this embolization to be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Late embolization occurs in a minority of patients and may account for the small but significant risk of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Doppler monitoring may allow identification of patients at risk and assessment of the effectiveness of prophylactic therapy </plain></SENT>
