<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals appear as uniform and predictable shapes within the RF signal, enabling pattern recognition and image processing techniques to be used for their automated detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper uses principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) to characterise the typical variation in embolic signal shape, within the RF signal, using training sets of in vitro and in vivo data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> techniques are then utilised to discriminate between previously unseen embolic and artifact signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the results of this study show that the algorithms described in this paper do not yet have the accuracy required for their use in a clinical setting, it does demonstrate that this novel technique has the potential to be developed further </plain></SENT>
