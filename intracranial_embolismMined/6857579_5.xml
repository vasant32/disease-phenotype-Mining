<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve was replaced in 31 patients, the mitral valve in four, and both in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (65.5%) were in functional class IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> according to the New York Heart Association criteria, and 13 patients (32.5%) were in class III <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> at the time of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient in class II was operated on urgently for multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> but died of fatal cerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 22 patients (55%) there were no pre-existing valvular lesions and these patients were found to be more liable to develop severe haemodynamic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Premature closure of the mitral valve, documented by M-mode echocardiography, was a useful <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33295">diagnostic aid</z:chebi> and successfully determined the best timing of surgery in 14 out of 20 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>Cardiac arrest</z:hpo> before operation appeared to be a significant risk factor (p = 0.0015) unless followed by immediate cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were eight operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 26 patients who were in functional class IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, 19 were operated on within four days of their haemodynamic deterioration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The operation was delayed in the remaining seven patients and none of them survived (p = 0.000003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among the patients in class III <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was only one episode of reinfection in the 16 patients followed up for at least three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The duration of postoperative antibiotic treatment (four to six weeks in our patients), rather than any preoperative antibiotic regimen, seems to be important for preventing reinfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At present there are 28 survivors, of whom 24 are in functional class I and four in class II </plain></SENT>
