<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SCAD density is increased with the use of cardiotomy suction to scavenge shed blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine whether various methods of processing shed blood during CPB decrease cerebral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> microembolic burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After hypothermic CPB (70 minutes), brain tissue from two groups of mongrel dogs (28 to 35 kg) was examined for the presence of SCADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the arterial filter (AF) group (n = 12), shed blood was collected in a cardiotomy suction reservoir and reinfused through the arterial circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three different arterial line filters (Pall LeukoGuard, Pall StatPrime, Bentley Duraflo) were used alone and in various combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the cell saver (CS) group (n = 12), shed blood was collected in a cell saver with intermittent preocessing (Medtronic autoLog model) or a continuous-action cell saver (Fresenius Continuous Auto Transfusion System) and reinfused with and without leukocyte filtration through the CPB circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean SCAD density (SCAD/cm2) in the CS group was less than the AF group (11 +/- 3 vs 24 +/- 5, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in SCAD density with leukocyte filtration or with the various arterial line filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean SCAD density for the continuous-action cell saver was 8 +/- 2 versus 13 +/- 5 for the intermittent-action device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of a cell saver to scavenge shed blood during CPB decreases cerebral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> microembolization </plain></SENT>
