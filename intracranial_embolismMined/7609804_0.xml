<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Neurological departments of Dutch teaching hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Analysis of data of patients admitted to the neurological wards of nine teaching hospitals, diagnosed from 1970 to 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a clinical diagnosis of CVST, confirmed by X-ray angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, surgery or autopsy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical condition of patients after 3 months was scored on a 4-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 93 patients 62 fulfilled the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three months after the diagnosis 41 patients (66%) had recovered, 10 patients (16%) were seriously disabled, 11 patients (18%) had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with a poor outcome were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> (relative risk 3.5) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> (relative risk 2.3) at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Signs of cerebral haemorrhage or infarction (by computed X-ray tomography) were associated with disability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment was not significantly associated with a better or poorer outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirms the variations in causes, clinical presentation, natural history, and treatment of CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No conclusion could be drawn about the effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
