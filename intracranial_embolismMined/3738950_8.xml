<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> accounted for 70% of cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) for the remaining 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By analysing this material we found an average age-adjusted incidence rate of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> of 14.4/100.000 among men and 15.5/100.000 among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates rose rapidly with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women aged 15-34 had significantly higher incidence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> compared to those of men of the same age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was reversed in the age group 35-44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the ratio between the female and the male mean incidence rates by increasing age corresponded exactly to the age distribution of the use of oral contraceptives in Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative risk for developing cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> among users of oral contraceptives was estimated to be 3.2-6.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality in male patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was 3.3% and in females 1.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of stay in hospital was 8.8 days for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and about 26 days for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen percent of men and 13.6% of women had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during their stay </plain></SENT>
