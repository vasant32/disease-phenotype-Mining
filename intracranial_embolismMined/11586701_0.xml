<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After routine TCD, bilateral embolic monitoring of middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) has been carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides, the functional test with breath-holding for cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) was made in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control group consisted of 18 healthy volunteers without any ICA abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the study reveal that CVR--the index of brain circulation autoregulation safety--is more exact marker of its stability than a degree of extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD embolic monitoring of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> enables not only to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> but to elicit the embolic source origin (arterio-arterial or cardial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, both TCD with breath-holding and TCD embolic monitoring facilitate identification of patients at high risk of ischemic events, which is important for brain ischemic disease prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
