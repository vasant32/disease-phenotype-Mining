<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nor does Broca area infarction cause Broca <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions in 20 cases observed since 1972 were documented by autopsy, computerized tomography, or arteriogram; the autopsy records from the Massachusetts General hospital for the past 20 years and the published cases since 1820 were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that infarction affecting the Broca area and its immediate environs, even deep into the brain, causes a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002300'>mutism</z:hpo> that is replaced by rapidly improving dyspraxic and effortful articulation, but that no significant distrubance in language function persists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The more complex syndrome traditionally referred to as Broca <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, including Broca's original case, is characterized by protracted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002300'>mutism</z:hpo>, verbal stereotypes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242186" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">agrammatism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is associated with a considerably larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> which encompasses the operculum, including the Broca area, insula, and adjacent cerebrum, in the territory supplied by the upper division of the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
