<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 2001 and 2005, 33 CAS procedures in 32 patients (23 [72%] male, 19 [58%] symptomatic, mean age 72.5 years [range 54.6 to 83.9]) scheduled for CAS were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral fundoscopy with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photography was performed by an experienced ophthalmologist immediately before, immediately after (fundoscopy only), and 1 day after the procedure and again at long-term follow-up (mean 37 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual field testing was performed before CAS and again at long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> were stratified to five procedural phases: wiring, predilatation, stent placement, postdilatation, and cerebral protection device (CPD) use (if applicable) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To establish correlation between TCD data and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolization, Mann-Whitney test was used, and P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were performed successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In five of 33 procedures (15%), new <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the procedures with emboli had small <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of five were performed using CPDs versus seven of 28 that had no <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli (P = not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of four patients (50%) with previous radiation therapy to the neck had new <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli versus three of 29 patients (10%) who had no previous radiation therapy (P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the other patient characteristics was associated with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 30 (91%) of patients with an adequate acoustic temporal window for TCD monitoring, there was no statistically significant correlation between TCD data and the incidence of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On long-term follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> embolization during CAS is not uncommon, and it occurs in both protected and unprotected procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Most <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli are clinically silent </plain></SENT>
