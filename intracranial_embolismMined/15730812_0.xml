<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of dynamic bubble trap (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi>) on air microbubble elimination from both the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit and middle cerebral arteries, and evaluate its possible impact on blood cells and coagulatory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), 12 males and 8 females, with similar perioperative data were assigned randomly to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> group and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each CABG was finished with identical circuit sets except the integration of a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> between the arterial filtrator and the aortic cannula in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Air microbubbles were detected before and after the integration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> with ultrasonographic detector and microembolism signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in middle cerebral arteries were counted by transcranial Doppler (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (PFH), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), fibrinogen, platelet count, coagulation factor II and anti-thrombin III (ATIII) were also assayed respectively before the operation, at the termination of CPB, and 6 hours after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> group the microbubbles of different size could be expelled significantly with the clearance rates between 68% - 74% (10 - 120 microm bubbles), 79% - 81% (20 - 120 microm bubbles), and 88% - 96% (40 - 120 microm bubbles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the total CPB phase, the mean number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> reached 197 +/- 137 in the control group and 158 +/- 178 in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> group, without a significant difference between these 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PFH and LDH levels raised while the platelet count, fibrinogen level, and coagulation factor II and AT III activities decreased sharply after CPB in these 2 groups, however without significant differences in these parameters between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> integration into the CPB circuit enhances neither blood cell damage nor coagulation disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> effectively eliminates air microbubbles in arterial conduit; however, its microembolus elimination function is prone to die down during the total period of CPB </plain></SENT>
