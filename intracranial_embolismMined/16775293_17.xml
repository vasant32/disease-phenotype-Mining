<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess by diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DWI) the efficacy of cerebral protection devices in avoiding embolization and new ischemic lesions in patients with severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis undergoing carotid artery stent placement (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred sixty-two CASs in the extracranial ICA were performed with the use of distal filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the patients was 68.5 years (range, 33-86) and 122 patients (75.3%) were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during the 3-day period before CAS, and DWI was obtained within 24 hours after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five patients (58.6%) were monitored by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography for microemboli detection in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), ipsilateral to the vessel being treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (17.3%) showed 58 new ischemic foci in DWI, and 13 patients (46.4%) had multiple foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Location of new lesions was mainly in the vascular territory supplied by the treated vessel (19 patients; 67.9%), but also in the contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (1 patient; 3.6%), and the posterior fossa (4 patients; 14.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship (P &lt; .03) was found between occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and appearance of new lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) were detected in 88 patients (92.6%), with no relationship between number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and the appearance of new ischemic foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: New ischemic foci were observed in 17.3% of the patients undergoing neuroprotected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Appearance of new ischemic lesions were only significantly related to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> but not to the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> registered or other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the encouraging results, the incidence of new ischemic lesions should promote research for safer techniques and devices </plain></SENT>
