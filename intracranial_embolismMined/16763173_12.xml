<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and energy failure from reduced oxygen supply are unknown in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> carotid-territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were studied prospectively with both diffusion tensor-imaging and back-to-back steady-state <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi>-PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Substantial numbers of voxels with oxygen extraction fraction &gt;0.70 (ie, significant ongoing <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>) were identified in 3 patients (imaged at 7, 16 and 21 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this voxel population, the quantitative relationships between the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and cerebral blood flow (CBF), were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> remained essentially unchanged until CBF reached values approximately 20 mls/100g per min, beyond which it declined linearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, except when severely reduced, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was a poorer predictor of CMRO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For both CBF and CMRO2, however, the relationship with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> became steeper with longer times since <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, ie, the same <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reflected lower perfusion and CMRO2 with elapsed time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small sample and late times from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the findings indicate that the degree of restricted water diffusion reliably reflects the severity of oxygen deprivation below the penumbral threshold but is less strongly related to metabolic disruption, which may explain why the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> does not reliably predict tissue outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the same degree of diffusion restriction may correspond to greater severity of tissue disruption with elapsing time, which has relevance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Time elapsed since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> should be taken into account when interpreting <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> declines and in voxel-based <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> prediction models </plain></SENT>
