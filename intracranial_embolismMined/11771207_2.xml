<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The symptomatic patient showing a string sign or ulcerative stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is subject to a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> or persisting intracranial embolization during the waiting period before operative revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: During one year 186 operative revascularization procedures of the ICA were performed on the symptomatic patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>26 of them fulfilled the prophylactic urgency criteria: symptoms of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> and a string sign or ulcerative stenosis of the ICA with ulceration greater than 2 mm in depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results were compared to the control group of the 157 procedures under elective circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean clamping time of the urgency and the elective patients were 23.8 min vs. 24.5 min and operation time 50.1 min vs. 54.3 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of our urgency patients presented new neurological defects in the postoperative phase, while this occurred in 3.8% in the elective group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate in the elective group was 2.7% and 0% in the urgency group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were fewer local complications in the urgency group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The urgent indication for the desobliteration of the ICA showing a symptomatic string sign or ulcerative stenosis can be recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or neurological defects during the waiting period may be prevented without increasing complication rates </plain></SENT>
