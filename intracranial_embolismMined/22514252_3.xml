<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Known risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment are largely the same as those predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate how to maximize the likelihood of avoiding both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 182 678 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register were studied for an average of 1.5 years (260 000 patient-years at risk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified according to risk scores with the use of historic International Classification of Disease diagnostic codes in the register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information about medication was obtained from the Swedish Drug Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our primary end point was net benefit defined as number of avoided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> with anticoagulation minus the number of excess <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleedings</z:mp> with a weight of 1.5 to compensate for the generally more severe outcome with <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleedings</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjusted net clinical benefit favored anticoagulation for almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The exceptions were patients at very low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 0 and moderately elevated <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk (-1.7%/y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results were broadly similar with CHADS(2), except for patients with very low embolic risk; the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc was able to identify those patients (n=6205, 3.9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients) who had no net clinical benefit or even some disadvantage from <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> without <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment is higher than the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the net benefit indicates that more patients may benefit from <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
