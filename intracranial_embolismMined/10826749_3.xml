<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In patients with mechanical heart valves (MHVs), transcranial Doppler methods commonly detect high intensity transient signals (HITS) representing microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These microemboli, which are presumably gaseous, may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A bovine model was therefore developed for studying the relationship between mitral MHV induced HITS and potential etiogenic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We placed an 18 mm, 4 MHz Doppler probe in the brachiocephalic artery to detect MHV induced microbubbles at baseline (rest) and under 9 other conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the gas composition (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> or N2) of the microbubbles, we administered 1%, 3%, and 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>, and 100% O2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine effect of the heart rate, we paced the heart at 120, 160, and 180 bpm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To alter the myocardial contractility, we gave dobutamine and esmolol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two independent, blinded observers counted the HITS from recorded doppler spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HITS were defined by an initial unidirectional spectral deviation, a signal power of &gt;8 dB relative to the background power, and lack of a cyclic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiogram, aortic and LV pressures, and LV dP/dt were obtained telemetrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The calves were studied 4 to 6, 8 to 10, and 12 to 14 weeks postoperatively, after which the animals were sacrificed at an approximate 4 month study duration, and a postmortem evaluation of the heart and the main viscera was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 27 HITS recordings were made in 10 calves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Myocardial contractility was the only factor to significantly affect HITS frequency; the heart rate and blood gas concentrations had minimal effect on HITS frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our bovine model will be useful for assessing valve designs, as well as the mechanism of HITS, the composition of the microemboli, and their possible pathophysiologic effects on the kidneys and brain </plain></SENT>
