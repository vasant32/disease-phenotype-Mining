<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about early indicators of complication risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective study on 330 consecutive patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were informed about oral anticoagulation by a structured teaching program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups were divided as to whether they received usual medical care provided by a family physician (n=220) or self-management (n=110) on a portable coagulation monitor (CoaguChek System) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow up of 13.3+/-4.4 months, the participants of the study were interviewed by a structured questionnaire to obtain information about hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications as well as survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison to patients under usual care, patients with INR selfmanagement were significantly younger (58 vs 64 years) and had fewer comorbidities (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) as well as a higher ejection fraction (53.6 vs 51.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indication for anticoagulation, age and heart rhythm explained 58% of the differences between the management groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the overall complication rates between the two groups (usual care vs selfmanagement): major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> 0.5 vs 0.9%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) 1.9 vs 0.9%, hospital admission 2.3 vs 1.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A high BMI (OR=1.5; 95% CI 1.06-1.25; p=0.001) or a high therapeutic INR range (OR=2.42; 95% CI 1.16-5.1; p=0.019) is associated with a higher complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Complication rates for patients with long-term oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy did not differ significantly between usual care and self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rather, the patient's body weight and the requirement of high anticoagulation intensity drive the complication risk under both management systems </plain></SENT>
