<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients, submitted to 34 carotid endarterectomies, from September, 1992 to April, 1996, on Hospital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1387055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Albert</z:e> Einstein, SÃ£o Paulo, have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these surgeries, Middle Cerebral Artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was miniaturized with Transcranial Doppler (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study were to verify the relationship between <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood flow velocity with postoperative neurologic complications: studying the velocity variations with risk of cerebral low perfusion and carotid stump back pressure, during carotid clamping; confirming that the TCD information, could show when it is necessary to use shunting, and its efficiency; and to know whether the method could detect intraoperative embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The equipment used was a Transpect TCD-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e> 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During surgery, when carotid stump back pressure was bellow of 54.4 mmHg, Pruitt-Inahara shunt was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The flow velocity value observed with TCD was divided in 3 parts: phase 1, basal, since anesthesy induction until carotid clamping; phase 2, clamping, during the period when the carotid artery was occluded; phase 3, post-declamping, from the time the carotid artery was declamping until the end of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocity was available on three phases, in cm/s and percentually on phases 2 and 3, in relation to basal phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The embolizations, detected by TCD, were classified in: a) a few embolizations in less than 10 second period, b) many embolizations in more than 10 second period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the results obtained, its possible to conclude that the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocity is related to the risk of cerebral low perfusion during carotid clamping; it was not possible to stablish any relation of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocity to carotid stump back pressure; the TCD informs when the use of shunt is necessary and its efficiency; the postoperative neurologic complications were caused by embolizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The conclusion is that the TCD is useful and easily applicated on carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
