<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the significance of these emboli has not yet been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We monitored 82 patients during coronary artery bypass grafting with this technique and related the numbers of emboli to the outcomes and length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 4; 4.9%) had a mean of 449 emboli, as compared with 169 emboli in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 78) (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with major cardiac complications (n = 7) had a mean of 392 emboli, as compared with 163 in patients without such complications (n = 75) (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean hospital stay of survivors was 8.6 days in patients with fewer than 100 emboli (n = 40), 13.5 days in patients with 101 to 300 emboli (n = 23), 16.3 days in those with 301 to 500 emboli (n = 16), and 55.8 days in patients with more than 500 emboli (n = 6) (p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This relation was unchanged when patients with complications were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between embolization and outcome was independent of the extent of aortic atheroma or age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Emboli detected during coronary artery bypass grafting are significantly related to major cardiac and neurologic complications and affect length of stay in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, even in the absence of such specific complications </plain></SENT>
