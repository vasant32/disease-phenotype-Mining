<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No dose rate response of cerebral arterial recanalization was observed in 93 patients who completed the rt-PA infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery division (M2) and branch (M3) occlusions were more likely to undergo recanalization by 60 minutes than were internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
