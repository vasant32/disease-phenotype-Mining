<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dynamic bubble trap (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi>), which removes air microbubbles from the arterial blood, was tested in a clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to evaluate the efficiency of microbubble removal under clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As blood passes through the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi>, which is placed in the arterial line between the arterial filter and arterial cannula, it is converted into a rotating stream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bubbles are directed to the centre of the blood flow and are collected in the distal end of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi>, from where they are returned to the cardiotomy reservoir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasonography was used to detect the microbubbles before and after the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi>, and also the number of high-intensity transient signals (HITS) in the right and left middle cerebral artery during extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction of microbubbles in the arterial line (3,990 before <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi>, 537 after, p &lt; 0.001) and HITS in the brain (51 in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> group, 77 in the placebo group, p = 0.04) was measured </plain></SENT>
