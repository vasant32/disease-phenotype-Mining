<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The true incidence of ABE, including subclinical brain embolization, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively studied 56 patients with definite left-sided infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined by a study neurologist, and those without contraindication had magnetic resonance imaging of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients without clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but with magnetic resonance imaging evidence of ABE were considered to have subclinical brain embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was present in 14 of 56 patients (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 40 patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, the incidence rates of subclinical brain embolization and any ABE were 48% and 80%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ABE was present in 18 of 19 patients (95%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318973" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Staphylococcus aureus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, mortality was similar among patients with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and subclinical brain embolization (62% versus 53%; P=NS) and was higher among patients with any ABE than among those without ABE (56% versus 12%; P=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Valvular surgery was performed in 25 patients (45%), including 16 with ABE, at a median of 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered a postoperative neurological complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgery was independently associated with a lower risk of mortality at 3 months (odds ratio, 0.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.6; P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging detected subclinical brain embolization in a substantial number of patients with left-sided infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, suggesting that the incidence of ABE may be significantly higher than reports based on clinical and computed tomography findings have indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging may play a role in the complex decision about surgical intervention in infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
