<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the number and extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, as represented by new lesions on diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DWI), in patients treated with filter-protected carotid stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Standard DWI (B0 = 1000) was performed within 48 hours before and 48 hours after filter-protected carotid stent placement in 50 patients with symptomatic, high grade (&gt;70%), atherosclerotic ICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Number, extent, and vascular territory of new DWI lesions after stent placement were assessed by consensus of 2 experienced neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multifactorial statistical analysis was performed to determine risk factors associated with DWI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: New punctate DWI lesions with a median diameter of 2 mm were detected in 14 of 50 cases in the territory of the stented ICA and in 7 of 50 cases in other vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median lesion load was 1 lesion (range, 1-15) per positive case in the stented ICA and 1 lesion (range, 1-7) in other vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> DWI lesions were clinically asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of 1 hyperperfusion syndrome with temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, the 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age &gt;or =70 years was the only significant predictor for new DWI lesions, whereas sex, degree and site of stenosis, vascular risk factors, and stent and filter type showed no significant correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: New DWI lesions after filter-protected carotid stent placement are substantially more frequent in the ipsilateral ICA territory compared with other vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, intraluminal filters cannot completely protect the brain from procedure-related embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, individual lesion load and the risk of clinically relevant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is low </plain></SENT>
