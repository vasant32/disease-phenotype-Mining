<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While contrast transthoracic echocardiography has been used to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, contrast transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has a greater sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior studies reported the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in patients presenting with a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: To determine the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in a more general population, we reviewed 1,000 consecutive TEEs performed with contrast and color Doppler for the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and other cardioembolic risk factors, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>), aortic plaque, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AFib), and atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While imaging with monoplane or biplane TEE, multiple injections of agitated saline solution were injected during cough or Valsalva maneuver to detect flow through a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: There were 482 male and 518 female patients with mean age of 60 +/- 17 years (range 11 to 93 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>Patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> was found in 9.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and, though seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups divided by decade, the incidence in patients aged 40 to 49 years was greater than those aged 70 to 79 years (12.96% vs 6.15%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrast TEE had a much higher detection rate than color Doppler alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, there was no greater incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in patients with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> vs those without <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, or in male vs female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, there was a very strong correlation between the presence of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> (p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thus, <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> detected by TEE, frequently seen with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, is seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups and does not in itself present a risk factor for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002641'>peripheral thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> needs further study </plain></SENT>
