<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies have shown that use of the Trendelenburg position does not prevent air emboli from reaching the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the position can decrease the velocity at which bubbles approach the brain, giving more time for nitrogen in the bubbles to be absorbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We applied a validated mathematical model to estimate that the maximum rate of absorption of microscopic air emboli in blood during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) equals 1.57 microns/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This rate is very small, since clinically relevant microbubbles have radii 50-1500 microns, and travel from the aorta to the brain within seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The result holds for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> usual conditions of CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that absorption does not affect the disposition of air introduced into the arterial circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of the Trendelenburg position cannot decrease neurologic injury from cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> by permitting greater bubble absorption </plain></SENT>
