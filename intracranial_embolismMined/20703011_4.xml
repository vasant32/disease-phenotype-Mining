<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to establish a novel embolic model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and to evaluate the effect of Stachybotrys microspora triprenyl <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>-7 (SMTP-7), a novel fungal triprenyl <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> metabolite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic occlusion was induced by transfer of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> into the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The regional cerebral blood flow was measured by a laser Doppler flowmeter to check the ischemic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infarction area was assessed by 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores were determined by a modified version of the method described by Longa et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emboli were accumulated at the temporal or parietal region of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we found that this model showed decreased cerebral blood flow and increased infarction area and neurological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) reduced infarction area and the neurological scores in a dose-dependent manner; moreover, the decreased cerebral blood flow recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SMTP-7 also reduced these values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic time window of SMTP-7 was longer than that of t-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that this model may be useful for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and evaluating the effects of therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, SMTP-7 is a promising approach to extend the therapeutic time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this novel compound may represent a novel approach for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
