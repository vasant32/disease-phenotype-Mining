<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients harboring an unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> may present with ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study is to assess the clinical and radiological characteristics and the outcome following treatment of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included 463 patients with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> treated between January 2000 and November 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> manifesting with ischemic events were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was assessed 12 months following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment using the modified Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients were included in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesion in the symptomatic territory was demonstrated in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were located on the internal carotid artery (n=4), middle cerebral artery (n=4), superior cerebellar artery (n=2) and basilar artery (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They measured 10 mm or less (n=7); 11-20 mm (n=2); more than 21 mm (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were partially thrombosed on imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients were referred for coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of these, one patient had an unsuccessful coiling attempt, one had a residual neck, and three presented an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six patients were treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> occurred after surgery in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> exclusion was documented in five of six operated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nine of the ten treated patients had a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even though <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> presenting with ischemic events are often small and located on the anterior circulation, in this series the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment is noteworthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This information is relevant given the possible benign natural history in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> for some of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
