<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is unclear if low flow velocity in the left atrial appendage (LAA) is a predisposing factor to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (NVAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated flow velocity in the LAA in NVAF patients in relation to a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other potential embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured and analyzed peak flow velocities into (FV-in) and out of (FV-out) the LAA in a middle portion of the LAA in 35 NVAF patients by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We divided the NVAF patients into 3 groups: the Eaf group had a history of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without any other potential embolic sources; the Emulti group had other potential embolic sources, and the control group had no embolic history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FV-in and FV-out in the Eaf group (12.3 +/- 6.7 and 10.2 +/- 7.3 cm/s) were significantly lower than those in the control group (24.3 +/- 11.3 and 19.9 +/- 8.8 cm/s; multicomparison Scheff√©'s test, p = 0.0123 and 0.0395, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Emulti group varied in those values from less than 5 to above 35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low flow velocity in the LAA seems to be a predisposing factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in NVAF patients without any other sources of emboli </plain></SENT>
