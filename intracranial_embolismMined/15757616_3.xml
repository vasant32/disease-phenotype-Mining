<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between July 1998 and March 2002, 305 consecutive patients who underwent elective or urgent percutaneous carotid intervention at The Cleveland Clinic were prospectively followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During this period, the clinical practice of carotid stenting evolved from the routine use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs) to routine emboli-prevention device (EPD) placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 199 patients received adjunctive GPIs (91% abciximab), and 106 patients underwent the procedure with an EPD (85% filter design, 15% occlusive balloon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 30 days, the composite end point of neurologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, was significantly lower among patients treated with EPDs compared with those treated with GPIs (0% vs 5.1%, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EPDs may provide an overall safer and more effective means of neuroprotection during carotid stenting than GPIs </plain></SENT>
