<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study determined whether a new aortic cannula (Cardeon Aegis) could substantially reduce brain embolization in a swine CPB model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen 70-kg pigs underwent normothermic CPB, 7 animals with the Aegis device and 7 with a control cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was determined using 15-microm fluorescent microspheres before bypass and twice during CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the second bypass CBF measurement, animals were embolized with 120,000 78-microm fluorescent microspheres at normothermia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiment the brain, eyes, kidneys, myocardium, and small bowel were removed and the microspheres isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral blood flow was equivalent between groups before bypass and during both bypass periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the two groups were equivalent with regard to pump flow, temperature, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and PaCO2, use of the Aegis cannula markedly reduced embolization to three of four brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deployment of the baffle reduced total brain embolization by 91% from a mean of 22 +/- 21 emboli per gram in the control animals to 2 +/- 6 emboli per gram in animals receiving the Aegis device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral blood flow with the Aegis device is equal to or greater than that observed under nonbypass conditions and that seen with conventional aortic cannulas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, cerebral embolization is profoundly reduced by use of the Aegis device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The application of this cannula may reduce postcardiac surgical neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
