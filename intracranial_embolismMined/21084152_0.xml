<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This novel explanation should help the development of sensitive microembolus discrimination techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the frequency modulation detected is caused by the ultrasonic radiation force (URF) acting directly on microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency modulation and the imposed displacement were calculated using a numerical dynamic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By setting simulation parameters with practical values, it was possible to reproduce most microembolic frequency modulation signatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most interesting findings in this study were that: (1) the ultrasound radiation force acting on a gaseous microembolus and its corresponding cumulative displacement were far higher than those obtained for a solid microembolus, and that is encouraging for discrimination purposes; and 2) the calculated frequency modulation indices (FMIs) (â‰ˆ20 kHz) were in good agreement with literature results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By taking into account the URF, the flow pulsatility, the beam-to-flow angle and both the velocity and the ultrasound beam profiles, it was possible to explain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> erratic FM signatures of a microbubble </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, by measuring FMI from simulated Doppler signals and by using a constant threshold of 1 KHz, it was possible to discriminate gaseous from solid microemboli with ease </plain></SENT>
