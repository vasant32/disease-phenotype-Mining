<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty patients were catheterized for closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> with the Rashkind <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo> umbrella device, a modified Rashkind umbrella device, and the newly designed Lock Clamshell Occluder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients weighed 8 kg or more (a requirement for transvenous access with the 11F delivery sheath) and had defects suitable for closure based on two-dimensional echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The new device was at least 1.6 times the diameter of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> as determined by balloon sizing at catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up by telephone, clinical examination, and echocardiography at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We attempted closure in 34 patients, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> ranging in diameter from 3 to 22 mm; device sizes ranged from 17 to 33 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial device position immediately after release was correct in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> occurred in one elderly patient before device placement--the patient died 1 week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two instances of early device embolization occurred, and devices were retrieved by catheter without complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of 31 patients discharged with devices in place, for a total of 31 patient-years, has yielded no umbrella-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adequate imaging studies in 19 patients 6.5 months after device placement revealed no atrial shunt in 12; residual flow through separate, previously unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> occurred in two; and small residual leaks (less than 3 mm) around devices were present in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This initial success indicates that double-umbrella closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> will aid in the treatment of intracardiac defects </plain></SENT>
