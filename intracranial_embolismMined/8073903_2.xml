<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> represents a risk factor of early thrombotic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In a group of patients under 55 years of age (n = 33, 19 males) which had suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from 3 months to 1 year before the study, defined by clinical criteria and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> confirmed by tomography, without history or predisposition to embolic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were matched with a group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls of checkup program, in terms of age, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients and controls with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e>, clinical or laboratory signs of renal or hepatic insufficiency or with a history of recent ingestion of Group B vitamins were excluded since these conditions would influence homocysteinemia levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured the plasmatic basal homocysteinemia of patients and controls (HC) and 6 hours later a methionine overload of 0.1 g/Kg body weight (LOAD HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients; Controls; Signific.; Age 46.0 +/- 7.7; 45.9 +/- 7.8; NS; Basal HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>10.1 +/- 3.4; 8.5 +/- 1.7; p &lt; 0.05; Load HC 28.0 +/- 7.6; 22.7 +/- 5.5; p &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> appears as a risk factor for thrombotic cerebrovascular disease before the age of 55;-The measurement of homocysteinemia after the methionine loading test was more discriminative than the basal measurement;-A larger number of patients and controls will be necessary to establish the relative importance of homocysteinemia among other vascular risk factors in cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
