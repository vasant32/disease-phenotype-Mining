<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In most patients, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>valvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo> can be accurately assessed non-invasively by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, retrograde catheterisation of the aortic valve is often undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This procedure has a potential risk of neurological complications, with an unknown incidence of clinically silent embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to establish the frequency of clinically apparent and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> after this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively randomised 152 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>valvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo> at a German university hospital to receive either cardiac catheterisation with (n=101) or without (n=51) passage through the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent cranial MRI and neurological assessment within 48 h before and after the procedure to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Controls were 32 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>valvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo> who underwent coronary angiography and laevocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 22 of 101 patients (22%) who underwent retrograde catheterisation of the aortic valve had focal diffusion-imaging abnormalities in a pattern consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral embolic events after the procedure; three of these patients (3%) had clinically apparent neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, none of the patients without passage of the valve, or any of the controls, had evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> as assessed by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>valvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo> who undergo retrograde catheterisation of the aortic valve have a substantial risk of clinically apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, and frequently have silent ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients should be informed about these risks, and this procedure should be used only in patients with unclear echocardiographical findings when additional information is necessary for clinical management </plain></SENT>
