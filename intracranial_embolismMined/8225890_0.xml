<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether RBCs treated with hypertonic contrast media could induce circulatory as well as metabolic disturbances in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Autologous blood was mixed with an equal volume of meglumine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53691">diatrizoate</z:chebi> (306 mgI/mL); 50 microliters of this mixture was infused into the left internal carotid artery of rats 2 minutes after mixing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five minutes after infusion, the cerebral blood flow was determined using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>[<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi>-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), 1H-MRS and 1H-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were performed before and after infusion of the mixture to study changes in energy metabolites and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>), as well as the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The blood flow decreased by 70% to 80% in the left cerebral cortex and caudate-putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi>-MRS and 1H-MRS demonstrated derangement of oxidative phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1H-MRI demonstrated instant destruction of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and gradual progress of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that intracarotid infusion of RBCs treated with hypertonic contrast medium can induce embolization and subsequent ischemic damage to the brain </plain></SENT>
