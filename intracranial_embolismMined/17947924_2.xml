<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Intraoperative cerebral embolization is a greater concern in patients undergoing carotid-artery stenting (CAS) than in those undergoing the reference standard treatment carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and transcranial Doppler monitoring during CAS and CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 75 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, 40 undergoing CEA and 35 transfemoral protected CAS, underwent preoperative and postoperative cerebral DW-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 75 patients, 64 (85%) underwent intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring to evaluate the mean number of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) recorded in each procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient in the CEA but two in the CAS group had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (5.7%, P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> count on transcranial Doppler monitoring was higher in the CAS than in the CEA group (330.0 MES, range 2754 vs 13.2, range 0-49 MES; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI disclosed a significantly larger number of new ischemic lesions in the CAS than in the CEA group (40 lesions in 12/35 patients, 34.3% vs 4 lesions in 3/40 patients, 7.5%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the CEA group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with ischemic lesions were asymptomatic whereas in the CAS group 5 were symptomatic (14.3%) and 7 asymptomatic (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cerebral distribution also differed in the two groups: no CEA but 20% of CAS lesions were contralateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CAS is associated with a significantly higher rate of cerebral embolization than CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even though the clinical meaning of new postoperative ischemic lesions remains debatable, it seems prudent to reduce the embolic load by improving procedural techniques and cerebral protection devices </plain></SENT>
