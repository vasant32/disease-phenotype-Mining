<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging technique appears to be essentially without hazard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It does not rely on ionizing radiation, and no intravenous injections of contrast agent are necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI exploits the tissue's inherent biophysical characteristics to provide superior contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infarctions are well delineated by MRI, often better and earlier than CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the lack of MRI signal from bone and thus the lack of transverse artifact from bone often seen with CT, lesions in the posterior fossa are very well visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With MRI it is possible to obtain images in the transverse, coronal, and sagittal planes, which provides for good evaluation of lesion size and extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>Arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> have been visualized by MRI, but it is still too early to know whether MRI has any detection capability over CT in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>Subdural hematomas</z:hpo> have been well visualized by MRI, including cases of isodense subdurals not visualized by CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, MRI has not proven to have any advantage over CT in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, hemorrhagic infarction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In fact, for detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, CT may be better at the present time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infarction the surrounding area of Wallerian degeneration may cause the area of infarction to appear larger than it actually is </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hopefully, with further research into the use of different pulse sequence techniques and with good neuropathological correlation, the present limitations of MRI can be eliminated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
