<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was felt to be related to a procedure, and this occurred 3 weeks after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> or emboli, 8 cerebral vascular accidents, and 7 femoral artery complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient experienced a residual neurologic change following a procedure-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accident</z:e>, and this was a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clotting of the catheter without sequelae but necessitating procedural changes occurred in 10 instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transient nature of the neurologic deficits and the low mortality suggest that the emboli which occurred in these patients were small, possibly platelet-fibrin accumulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that with the use of careful technic larger emboli capable of producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> with shock or disabling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accidents</z:e> can be prevented, even in a training situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, smaller embolic phenomena probably cannot be completely avoided by the use of careful technic, and it is for prevention of small emboli that systemic anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> may be of value </plain></SENT>
