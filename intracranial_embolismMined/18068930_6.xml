<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of an optimized bright blood MRI protocol at 3 T in combination with contrast agent administration for the detection and characterization of aortic high-risk plaques for the improved workup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: ECG synchronized T1-weighted 3D gradient echo MRI was performed in 45 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were acquired with high near isotropic spatial resolution (approximately 1 mm(3)) covering the entire thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To compensate for breathing and vessel motion artifacts, images were collected using respiratory navigator gating in combination with short diastolic data acquisition windows adjusted on a patient-by-patient basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with aortic plaques &gt; or =3 mm in thickness, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> contrast agent was administered and both pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted 3D measurements with identical vessel coverage were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bright blood 3D MRI detected 33 high-risk plaques with an average maximum plaque thickness of 4.2+/-1.0 mm in 23 of 45 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The availability of pre- and post-contrast images acquired within the same session enhanced the identification of calcified plaque components in 77% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyzed plaques: post-contrast MRI clearly improved the delineation of hypointense plaque cores in 23 of 30 cases and assisted in the classification of core shape and of core fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 3D bright blood MRI at 3 T was feasible for the detection of aortic high-risk sources and may help to improve the detection of causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
