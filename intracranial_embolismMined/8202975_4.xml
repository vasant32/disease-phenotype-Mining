<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vital statistics show a sharp decline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality since the late 1960s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether this has been associated with a decline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1966 the Honolulu Heart Program has monitored the incidence and mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a target population of 11,136 men of Japanese ancestry living on Oahu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trends were analyzed from January 1, 1969, through December 31, 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 7893 men aged 45 to 68 years and free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at entry examination, 530 developed first episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the period 1969 to 1988 (389 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo>, 124 cases of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 17 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of unknown type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence declined from 5.1 per 1000 person-years in 1969 to 1972 to 2.4 in 1985 to 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo>, hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> decreased 3.5%, 4.2%, and 4.4% per year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 1-month case-fatality rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> decreased moderately; those for hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> fell dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the decline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality in the past two or three decades results from a decline in both incidence rates and early case-fatality rates in thromboembolic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of unknown type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decreases may be related to changes in risk factors, such as the decline in blood pressure and the decrease in cigarette smoking, as well as improvements in diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
