<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, due to nonstandardized reporting requirements for in-flight medical emergencies, the true incidence of pulmonary barotrauma in airplane passengers is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a passenger with an asymptomatic intrapulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> in whom a severe case of cerebral gas embolism developed during an aircraft flight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decrease in ambient pressure during the aircraft climb resulted in expansion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> volume based on Boyle's law (pressure x volume = constant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> expansion, we believe tears in the wall led to the leakage of air into the surrounding vessels followed by brain gas emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adult patients with intrapulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> should be strongly considered for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> resection or should at least be advised to abstain from activities leading to considerable changes in ambient pressure </plain></SENT>
