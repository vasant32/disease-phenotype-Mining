<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some form of predisposing factor was present in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a remarkably high incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease among the parents of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> victims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 50% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> known prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had received adequate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were six females on oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immediate mortality, i.e. within one month, was 35% essentially caused by a very high initial mortality among patients with cerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were checked after 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At this time, 16 patients were still alive and 11 able to perform some sort of work </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The chances of survival and vocational rehabilitation seem to be fairly good, compared with higher age groups, thus urgently calling upon the resources of the community for active therapeutic measures and training </plain></SENT>
