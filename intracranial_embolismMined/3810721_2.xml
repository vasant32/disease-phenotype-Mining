<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the anatomic origin of micro-emboli influences their intracranial distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In twenty-two baboons, we examined the distribution of 99-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">Technetium</z:chebi> labelled albumin aggregates (5 to 40 microns in size) after injection into the circulation at the left atrium (LA), carotid trifurcation (CA), and anterior and posterior common carotid artery (CCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a further subgroup, the emboli were introduced at the carotid trifurcation with the contralateral carotid artery ligated (CA + L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of this study demonstrated that aggregates introduced at the carotid artery lodged preferentially in the ophthalmic (p = 0.032) and middle cerebral artery territories (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the contralateral common carotid artery was ligated, however, more aggregates were found in the ipsi- and contralateral anterior cerebral artery territories (p = 0.01, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aggregates introduced into the cardiac circulation were equally distributed throughout the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This experimental model determined patterns of flow that might be analogous to the human situation where unilateral or bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or stenosis with contralateral occlusion has occurred or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> from cardiac source has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results do not imply that the 40 micron microaggregates do cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These experimental findings support clinical observations that cardiac lesions may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) anywhere in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, those of carotid artery origin cause predominantly middle cerebral or ophthalmic artery territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> unless the contralateral carotid artery is severely stenosed or occluded </plain></SENT>
