<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Much of the brain is perfused by penetrating arteries that are the "single source" of blood to their surrounding tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These tissues should be equally vulnerable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> from embolic occlusion, but there are questions about whether emboli have access to the penetrating arteries serving the deep brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine this issue in humans we recorded the number and distribution of new ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) after carotid artery stenting (CAS), a procedure producing showers of numerous small atheroemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine men (aged 62-81) underwent 30 CAS procedures with distal protection in place, and DWMRI 48 hours after the procedure documented new lesions had developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were asymptomatic, and 16 had experienced recent symptoms ipsilateral to the treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A DWMRI study was done in each patient â‰¤72 hours before the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> MRI studies were read by the same neuroradiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient sustained a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DWNRI found 131 new lesions (median, 3; range, 1-17; interquartile range, 2-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lesion size was &lt;5 mm in 96.6% and 5 to 10 mm in 3.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lesions were ipsilateral in 83.1% and contralateral in 16.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lesions were in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery (91.6%), posterior cerebral artery (6.1%), and superior cerebellar artery subclavian artery (2.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most lesions were in the cortex but at a depth where they were best described as cortical/subcortical (90.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rest were in the periventricular white matter (6.1%) and deep gray matter (3.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ischemic areas developing after CAS were predominately in the deeper layers of the cortex in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery, but lesions were seen throughout the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The distribution of lesions caused by CAS-induced embolization coincided with estimates of blood flow to the respective areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These data add to the evidence implicating microemboli in ischemic pathologies throughout the brain </plain></SENT>
