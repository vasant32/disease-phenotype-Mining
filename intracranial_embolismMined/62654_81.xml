<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The response normally consists of seven components in the initial 10 msec following click signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interruption of audiotory pathway at the junction of VII nerve with brainstem results in loss of response components after Wave I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interruption of auditory pathway at the midbrain results in loss of response components after Wave III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Wave I reflects activity of VIII nerve, Waves II and III reflect activity of cochlear nucleus, trapezoid body, and superior olive and Waves IV and V reflect activity of lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The generators of Waves VI and VII were not defined </plain></SENT>
