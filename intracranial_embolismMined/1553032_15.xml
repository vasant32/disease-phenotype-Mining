<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify regional vasodilatory capacity and its sequential change, we evaluated prospectively a total of 78 acetazolamide tests in 51 patients with occlusion or greater than 75% stenosis of the carotid or middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative distribution of cerebral blood flow was determined by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography using N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[123I]-iodoamphetamine before and after intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduced vasodilatory capacity was demonstrated in 20 patients (38%), including 5 patients with hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> tests revealed asymptomatic progression of the arterial lesion (from stenosis to occlusion) in 1 patient and almost complete improvement of vasodilatory capacity in 5 patients, including 3 without surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During an average follow-up period of 18.5 months, 4 patients died from cardiac causes or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>; no neurovascular events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Much larger numbers of patients with longer observation periods will be necessary to clarify the contribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodynamic failure to subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the present data indicate that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> test is useful for assessing the course of high grade stenosis or occlusion of major cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
