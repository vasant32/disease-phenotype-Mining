<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty subjects (28 male, 32 female aged 64 +/- 6 years) were included in the study of which 30 suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and 30 from cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>; the first group was subdivided into those subjects with quiescent preinfarction <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (21 cases) and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (9 cases), whereas the second group was subdivided into subjects with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (20 cases) and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (10 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each subject underwent an assay to assess fasting blood levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, antithrombin III (using a chromogenic method), plasminogen tissue activator, beta-thromboglobulin and dimer-D (ELISA method) 24 hours after being admitted to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From an analysis of results it was observed that of the four prothrombotic markers used, fibrinogen and factor VII showed a generic increase in comparison to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and cerebrovascular disease patients; this was paralleled by significant reduction of antithrombin III; differences were even more marked and significant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombo-occlusive (infarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) compared to functional forms (<z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In line with other studies, the Authors favour an irritative type endothelial response leading to a marked and surprising increase of tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two prothrombotic markers (BTG, D-D) also showed a thrombotic development in the two groups of patients examined with more significant findings in the occlusive forms (infarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) in comparison to transitory forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these and other published results the Authors confirm the usefulness of monitoring prothrombotic markers (fibrinogen, factor VII, AT III) in apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects with or without risk factors or with slight initial signs of arteriosclerotic disease; these call for longitudinal or cross-sectional studies of an epidemiology type, in addition to isolated assay for a generic assessment of the patient's biological status, even if it is not yet possible to elaborate a protocol for the certain and specific diagnosis of a thrombophilic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The value of prethrombotic markers is apparent in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusive stage of the disease as a form of prognostic and therapeutic monitoring, and in preinfarction and above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> silent transitory forms where, together with the use of other techniques (Holter), it provides interesting openings for confirming the diagnosis of an in vivo microthrombotic genesis and the consequent introduction of antithrombotic drug therapy </plain></SENT>
