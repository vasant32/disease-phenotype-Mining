<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> has not received wide acceptance because of the availability of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with its excellent results and because of the risk of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The feasibility and efficacy of cerebral protection devices that may prevent such embolic complications have yet to be shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our initial results with CAS performed with cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For a period of 28 months, 31 patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, most of whom were considered at high risk for CEA (87%), underwent treatment with CAS in conjunction with either the PercuSurge GuardWire (n = 19; Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn), the Cordis Angioguard filter (n = 7; Cordis, Warren, NJ), or the ArteriA Parodi Anti-embolization catheter (n = 4; ArteriA, San Francisco, Calif) with US Food and Drug Administration-approved investigational device exemptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors that made CEA high risk included restenosis after CEA (n = 6), hostile neck (n = 6), high or low lesions (n = 4), and severe comorbid medical conditions (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative neurologic symptoms were present in 58%, and the mean stenosis was 85% +/- 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were prospectively recorded and analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic evaluation was performed before and after CAS by a protocol neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CAS was performed with local anesthesia with the Wallstent (n = 23; Boston Scientific Corp, Natick, Mass) or the PRECISE carotid stent (n = 7; Cordis) in conjunction with one of the protection devices in an operating room with a mobile C-arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Each patient received dual antiplatelet therapy before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall technical success rate was 97% (30/31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the lesion could not be crossed with a guidewire because of a severely stenosed and tortuous lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This patient was not a candidate for CEA and was treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 30 cases, CAS had a good angiographic result (residual stenosis, &lt;10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients tolerated the protection device well, and no intraprocedural neurologic complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic embolic particles were recovered from each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One patient (3%) with a severely tortuous vessel had a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> immediately after CAS, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The combined 30 day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 17 months, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> occlusion of the stent occurred but did not result in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Three other patients had duplex scan-proven in-stent restenosis, and two underwent treatment with repeat percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with a good result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>No patient had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CAS with cerebral protection devices can be performed safely with a high technical success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although many patients who underwent treatment with CAS were at high risk, the neurologic complication rate was low and CAS appears to be an acceptable treatment option for select patients at high risk for CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Tight lesions and tortuous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> may make the use of distal protection devices difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Further study is warranted </plain></SENT>
