<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data showed the possibility to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation when the electrode-tissue interface cooling is optimized by a homogeneous flushing of saline along the entire surface of the distal electrode through a larger number of irrigation holes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study aim is to compare procedural parameters and safety of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) performed by using open-irrigated catheters with different irrigation design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty patients (74% males; age 57 Â± 12 years) with paroxysmal AF randomly underwent PVI performed with a new irrigation design catheter (group A, 40 patients) versus a standard irrigated catheter (group B, 40 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprocedural brain MRI unveiled SCL in 2 patients in group A and in 3 in group B (5% vs 7.5%, P = 0.500) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedural ACT was the only independent factor associated with the occurrence of SCL (OR = 0.996; 95% CI 0.994-0.998, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among procedural parameters, we observed a reduction of irrigation saline volume of 662 mL in group A versus group B (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PVI performed with a new irrigated catheter did not reduce significantly the SCL risk when compared to a standard irrigated catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedural ACT reduces the SCL risk of 0.4% for each point of ACT increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For ACT &gt; 320 seconds no SCL occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, compared to a standard irrigated catheter, PVI performed with a new irrigation design catheter reduces significantly saline volume infusion </plain></SENT>
