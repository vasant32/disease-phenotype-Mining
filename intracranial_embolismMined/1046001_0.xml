<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most suffered head injiries in traffic accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many patients were severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> or in a so-called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow was measured at rest and during various forms of stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resting values were on the whole markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The flow patterns often showed distinct correlations with the original brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the best preserved patients, mental activation caused increases in flow with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cutaneous electric stimulation gave rise to increases in cortical flow even in highly reduced patients with severe brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with total or less than total loss of telencephalic structures with retained brainstem reflexes and respiration ('apallic' patients) did not show any changes in flow on sensory stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the technique for measuring rCBF enables us to assess severe damage to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system quantitatively and also to estimate whether higher functions are retained in severely reduced patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, stupor and apallic state--patients who more or less completely lack behavioural responses </plain></SENT>
