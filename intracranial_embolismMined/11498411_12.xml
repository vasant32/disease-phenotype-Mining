<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There has been concern regarding the safety of revascularization procedures of vessels supplying the brain vessels because of the risk of cerebral embolization during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have observed a high incidence of hyperintense lesions on diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of the brain after stenting at the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis of this study is that diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain can reveal new diffusion abnormalities after angioplasty or angioplasty plus stenting of arteries supplying the brain, other than at the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we prospectively obtained diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of the brain before and after such revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven revascularization procedures were performed in 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven interventions were performed at the distal internal carotid artery, two at the external carotid artery, two at the common carotid artery, five at the innominate artery, five at the vertebral artery, and 12 at the proximal subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain was performed before and 24 hours after the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After eight (22%) of 37 procedures, new hyperintensities were visible on the diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With six of these eight procedures, the hyperintensities occurred in the vascular territory supplied by the treated vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In total, 35 new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> could be seen, 33 (94%) of which occurred in the vascular territory supplied by the treated vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in whom new diffusion abnormalities were found had new neurologic symptoms or deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No new lesions could be seen after procedures at the subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Revascularization procedures of arteries supplying the brain were associated with new lesions on the diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of the brain after 22% of the procedures, provided that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging could be performed, indicating the occurrence of cerebral microemboli during such procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain can be used as a tool to assess the impact of modifications of procedural technique and/or the use of cerebral protection devices on the occurrence of such lesions </plain></SENT>
