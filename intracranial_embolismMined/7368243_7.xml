<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From October 1, 1978 to March 31, 1979, 152 new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred giving an estimated overall incidence (per 100,000 population) for total and first attacks of 202 and 162, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No major sex difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages) was noted, although males did have a significantly higher incidence at 55--64 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence increased strikingly with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> comprised 83% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> 13% of attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Males and females differed little in distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was higher among older than younger cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The opposite was true regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> constituted a significantly higher proportion of cases at 65--74 years of age than at other ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>Hemiplegia</z:hpo> and speech deficits dominated the clinical picture at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 3-week case fatality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both a lowering of consciousness (found among 38% of cases during the first 24 hours) and a history of prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were found related to a reduction in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of patients surviving 3 weeks 25% were completely dependent and 25% partially dependent upon others for personal care </plain></SENT>
