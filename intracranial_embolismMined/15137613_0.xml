<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> puts the patient at risk for progressive neurological deficit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and, most importantly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> The hypercoagulation disorder may result in an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors describe a 42-year-old man with a Spetzler-Martin Grade 5 <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> who experienced progressive neurological decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was subsequently discovered to have partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, deep cerebral and cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and a hypercoagulation disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypercoagulation disorders causing neurological deficits are usually treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> medications; however, this approach was not thought to be safe in the presence of a large <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> nidus was surgically extirpated and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed to treat the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> caused by the cortical and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, lifelong oral anticoagulation was prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient had a progressive neurological recovery and is now living independently at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of partial or complete spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of an <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> nidus should raise the possibility of an underlying hypercoagulation disorder </plain></SENT>
