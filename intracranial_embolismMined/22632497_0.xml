<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESCRIPTION: Delivery tool and implant consisting of connectors imbedded in a compliant, soft <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> applied to the base of the LAA flush with the external wall was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EVALUATION: Patients in this prospective, multicenter trial were undergoing elective, nonendoscopic cardiac operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A core laboratory independently assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> intraprocedural and 90-day transesophageal echocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients (37 men), aged 33 to 86 years, enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean LAA application time was 27 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiograms at 90 days were available in 54 patients, and no leaks were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The residual LAA cavity exceeded 6 mm in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One delivery device failed to close, and an adjunctive suture was required to complete LAA exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient required adjunct sutures at a small tear site related to manual manipulation after fastener application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated safety and efficacy of this LAA exclusion device, offering an alternative to manual suturing or staples with or without reinforcement </plain></SENT>
