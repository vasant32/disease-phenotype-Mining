<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reactive elevations in fibrinogen levels that occur within hours of a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> invalidate most cross-sectional case-control studies evaluating fibrinogen as a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, as no elevation is seen following fresh episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e>, reliable conclusions drawn from a case-control study using such patients support the findings of the prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association is related to occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the relationship with intracerebral haemorrhage is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship has been found to be independent of other haemostatic and haemorheological factors (e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, tissue plasminogen activator and packed cell volume) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for regression dilution bias would further strengthen the observed relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, after blood pressure, fibrinogen is the most important potentially treatable risk factor for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are several mechanisms whereby fibrinogen could promote athero-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> through a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e>; the acceleration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>; or the reduction of blood flow due to high blood or plasma viscosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism, however, is unlikely to be mediated through high blood viscosity per se as secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>erythrocytosis</z:hpo> (another major determinant of blood viscosity) has not consistently been found to be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies relating fibrinogen levels to the degree of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> support the accelerating influence of fibrinogen on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen should be considered a risk factor for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and included in the assessment of individual risk factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
