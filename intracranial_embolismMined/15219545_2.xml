<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transesophageal approach has enhanced the ability to detect cardiac sources of embolism by allowing a better visualization of posterior cardiac structures such as the left atrium with left atrial appendage, pulmonary veins and thoracic aorta and by providing higher resolution images to improve assessment of the presence and extent of cardiac masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this case report, echocardiography, using both transthoracic and transesophageal approach, allowed to detect a neoplastic mass arising from the upper left pulmonary vein in a patient presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further investigations showed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> involving the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which a cerebral embolic episode represents the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, pointing out the importance of echocardiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of undetermined cerebral ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
