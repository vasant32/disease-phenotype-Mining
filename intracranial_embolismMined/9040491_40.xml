<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In male Wistar rats (n = 77), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was induced at the origin of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) by injection of thrombin via an intraluminal catheter placed in the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> induction and consequent ischemic cell damage were examined by histopathological analysis and neurological deficit scoring, and by measuring changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) using laser-Doppler flowmetery (LDF), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and by diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathology revealed that a fibrin-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> localized to the origin of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the right parietal cortex was reduced by 34-58% of preinjection levels after injection of thrombin in rats administered 30 U of thrombin (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a reduction in CBF and a hyperintensity DWI encompassing the territory supplied by the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats administered 80 U of thrombin was 31.29 +/- 12.9% of the contralateral hemisphere at 24 h (n = 13), and 34.7 +/- 16.4% of the contralateral hemisphere at 168 h (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats administered 30 U of thrombin exhibited a hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of 34.0 +/- 14.5% (n = 9) at 24 h and 29.7 +/- 13.9% (n = 8) at 168 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, thrombotic rats (n = 3) treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (10 mg/kg) 2 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> showed that CBF rapidly returned towards preischemic values as measured by PWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This model of thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is relevant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> in humans and may be useful in documenting the safety and efficacy of thrombolytic intervention as well as for investigating therapies complementary to antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
