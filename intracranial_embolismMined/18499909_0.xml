<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after transbrachial digital subtraction angiography under ambulant conditions using diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 200 patients were included in a prospective study design and received transbrachial digital subtraction angiography under ambulant conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after digital subtraction angiography, diffusion-weighted imaging of the brain was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our study population no new lesions were found in diffusion-weighted imaging after digital subtraction angiography during the 3-hour window after angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One new lesion was found 3 days after angiography as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the frequency of neurological complications is at the level of the confidence interval of 0 - 1.5 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The transbrachial approach under ambulant conditions is a safe method for digital subtraction angiography resulting in a low rate of ischemic lesions in diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
