<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment of large artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral occlusions</z:e> is rapidly evolving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that patients with intracranial embolic occlusions secondary to an extracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion have a higher probability of successful endovascular recanalization compared with those with cardioembolic occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the databases of three institutions (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), Michigan State University (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSU</z:e>) and Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF)) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> treated with endovascular therapies from January 2006 to July 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After collection of demographic, radiographic and angiographic variables, two groups were identified: artery to artery embolic occlusions and cardioembolic/cryptogenic intracranial occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We defined recanalization as TIMI 2 or 3 flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A binary logistic regression model was constructed to determine which characteristics were unique to patients with carotid embolic occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 207 patients were identified (UPMC=100, CCF=71, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSU</z:e>=36) with a mean age of 69±11 years and mean NIHSS of 17±5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 157 (75%) were due to a cardiac or cryptogenic source and 50 (25%) were from a carotid embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of multimodal therapy (OR 2.6 (1.2-5.6), p&lt;0.009) and the presence of a carotid embolic intracranial occlusion (OR 3.6 (1.2-7.1), p&lt;0.012) were associated with successful recanalization, while carotid terminus occlusions were associated with unsuccessful recanalization (OR 0.35 (0.18-0.68), p&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with intracranial occlusions secondary to an extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or total occlusion appear to have more successful recanalization rates when treated with endovascular therapy compared with those with cardioembolic occlusions </plain></SENT>
