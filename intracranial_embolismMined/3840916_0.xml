<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Highly significant correlations between activity and antigen prove the suitability of the methods </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The course of AT III and HC II during the process of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> suggests that HC II may function as a thrombin inhibitor reserve when AT III becomes subnormally low </plain></SENT>
