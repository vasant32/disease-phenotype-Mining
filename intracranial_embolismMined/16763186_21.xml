<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A 6-point scoring system (ABCD) was described recently for stratifying risk after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This score incorporates age (A), blood pressure (B), clinical features (C), and duration (D) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A score &lt;4 reportedly indicates minimal short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated this scoring system in an independent population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients (diagnosed by a neurologist using the classic &lt;24-hour definition) hospitalized &lt;48 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome assessment consisted of dichotomization of patients into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high-risk group included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 90 days, &gt; or =50% stenosis in a relevant artery, or a cardioembolic source warranting anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> others were classified as low risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Findings on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) were also evaluated when performed and patients classified as DWI+ or DWI- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 3 years, 117 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to enrollment was 25.2 hours (interquartile range 19.8 to 30.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, 26 patients (22%) were classified as high risk, including 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 15 with &gt; or =50% stenosis, and 10 with cardioembolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The frequency of high-risk patients increased with ABCD score (0 to 1 13%; 2 8%; 3 17%; 4 27%; 5 26%; 6 30%; P for trend=0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ABCD scores in the 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were 3 and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of those who underwent MRI, 15 of 61 (25%) were DWI+, but this correlated poorly with ABCD score (0 to 1 17%; 2 10%; 3 36%; 4 24%; 5 13%; 6 60%; P for trend=0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the ABCD score has some predictive value, patients with a score &lt;4 still have a substantial probability of having a high-risk cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> or radiographic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction despite transient symptoms </plain></SENT>
