<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this model an inflatable silastic balloon cuff has been implanted by transorbital approach around the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), proximal to the take-off of the lenticulostriate arteries (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inflation of the balloon for 3 hours in six animals produced a stereotypic sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome characterized by contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An infarction volume of 3.2 +/- 1.5 cm3 in the ipsilateral corpus striatum was documented by computerized tomographic (CT) scanning at 10 days following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction and 3.9 +/- 1.9 cm3 (n = 4) at 14 days by morphometric neuropathologic determinations of brain specimens fixed in situ by pressure-perfusion with 10% buffered formalin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediate pressure-perfusion fixation following deflation of the balloon was performed in 16 additional animals given Evans blue dye intravenously prior to the 3 hour <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> balloon occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy consistently confirmed the presence of thrombotic material occluding microcirculatory branches of the right <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> in the region of Evans blue stain, but not those of the contralateral corpus striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When autologous 111In-platelets were infused intravenously in four animals from the above group prior to the transient 3 hour occlusion of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, gamma scintillation camera imaging of each perfused-fixed whole brain demonstrated the presence of a single residual focus of 111In-platelet activity involving only the Evans blue-stained right corpus striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Focal right hemispheric activity was equivalent to 0.55 +/- 0.49 ml of whole blood, and the occlusion score derived from histologic examination of the microcirculation of the Evans blue-stained corpus striatum averaged 34.8 +/- 2.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar 111In-platelet imaging and histologic scoring experiments carried out in four animals pretreated with the antithrombotic combination <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> showed marked reduction of both 111In-platelet activity (0.01 +/- 0.03 ml vs. 0.55 +/- 0.49 ml; p less than 0.01) and thrombotic occlusion of the microcirculation (10.8 +/- 7.4 units vs. 34.8 +/- 2.8 units; p less than 0.01) in the right corpus striatum following 3 hours of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In separate control experiments 111In-labeled autologous platelets were infused after the 3 hour period of right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and subsequent balloon deflation in two animals; no focus of 111In-platelet activity was demonstrated in fixed whole brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
