<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old woman developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> after cardiac catheterization from a near-occlusive calcific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> to the left middle cerebral artery origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The calcific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was shown to be hemodynamically limiting by computed tomographic perfusion and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patient was treated medically for 6 days with anticoagulation, antiplatelet, and hypertensive therapies but continued to deteriorate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decision was made to attempt retrieval of the calcific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conventional intracranial mechanical clot and coil retrieval systems were used initially but were unsuccessful and caused migration of the calcific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, leading to complete occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At this point, the decision was made to wedge the calcific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> against the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A balloon-mounted coronary stent was used to achieve this successfully, resulting in recanalization of the middle cerebral artery trunk and flow restoration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Symptomatic calcific emboli, which are poorly responsive to pharmacological therapy and difficult to recover using conventional retrieval systems, may be treated by immobilization against the vessel wall using a balloon-mounted stent </plain></SENT>
