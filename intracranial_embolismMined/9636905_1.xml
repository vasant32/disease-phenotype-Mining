<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Cerebral microemboli are responsible to a large extent for the neuropsychiatric deficits after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in cannula size during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) will result in different velocities of blood exiting the aortic cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study determined whether the number of transcranial Doppler (TCD)-detected emboli in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) during CPB correlated with blood speed or the direction of flow as determined by the shape of the aortic cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients were studied prospectively for evidence of TCD-detected emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If patients met the inclusion criteria, the choice of cannula was determined by surgical preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies were conducted at a single tertiary care academic cardiac surgery hospital by a single observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two patients undergoing first-time elective aortocoronary bypass surgery who were free of neurologic dysfunction or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> and weighed 60 to 85 kg were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who had other concurrent cardiac operations or who were in cardiogenic shock were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Three aortic cannula types for elective aortocoronary bypass surgery were used: 24F curved (n = 19), 24F straight (n = 6), and 22F straight (n = 7), with internal diameters (IDs) of 7.2, 6.6, and 5.9 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD-detected emboli were identified in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The rate of TCD-detected emboli (0.02 to 11.4 emboli per minute) was not related to the velocity of blood (46 to 77 cm/s) and was not affected by the choice of either a straight or curved aortic cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The choice of a straight or curved aortic cannula or of a 24F versus 22F cannula may not be important with respect to the number of cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
