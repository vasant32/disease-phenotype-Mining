<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the dilemma posed by the observations that carotid angioplasty dislodges significant numbers of plaque fragments but is reported to have a low rate of neurologic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the fragments released by ex vivo carotid angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The smaller and most numerous were separated by size and injected into rats to determine the tolerance of the brain to microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ex vivo angioplasty was performed on a total of 20 human carotid plaques removed en bloc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plaques were placed within <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> grafts, and three manipulations were performed: guide wire insertion, 3.5- or 4.0-mm balloon angioplasty, and 5-mm angioplasty with or without a Palmaz stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After each manipulation, the lumen was flushed, effluent was collected, and fragments were counted under 100x magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using 200-microm and 500-microm micropore mesh, we separated fragments by size into two groups: (1) less than 200 microm and (2) 200 to 500 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We then injected rats with saline alone (Group A), with 100 fragments less than 200 microm (Group B), or with 100 fragments 200 to 500 microm (Group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Animals were euthanized at 1, 3, and 7 days, and brain sections were examined for cell viability and expression of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>- 72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total number of fragments dislodged from the plaques varied from 30 to 553 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean number of fragments released with each manipulation was as follows: guide wire passage, 24; initial balloon angioplasty, 97; second balloon angioplasty, 68; and second angioplasty plus stent, 172 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of the 20 plaques dislodged fragments that were 1 mm or more in greatest dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in Group A at any time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Group B also showed no injury at 1 or 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, injection of 200- to 500-microm fragments (Group C) caused a scattered pattern of neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At 7 days, brain sections from both Group B and Group C animals had a scattered pattern of ischemic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There were no classic wedge-shaped infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The brain appears to have a surprising tolerance for microembolization in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, carotid angioplasty may dislodge plaque fragments, but there may still be a low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, even small plaque fragments, less than 200 microm, may cause neuronal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at later time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural microemboli could cause subtle neurologic dysfunction in late follow-up </plain></SENT>
