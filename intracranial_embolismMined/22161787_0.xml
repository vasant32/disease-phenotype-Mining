<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate multifaceted factors that constrain early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment, from both clinical and social standpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a general hospital in northern Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on time to presenting to hospital after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and its potential associated factors were retrospectively extracted from the medical records of hospitalised <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median time of presenting to hospital after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> for 287 patients was 12 hours (range, 0.4-347 hours), and 16.7% of cases presented within 2 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed a significant level of association between a Japan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score of ≥1 (OR=0.41; 95% CI, 0.20-0.86) and cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (OR=0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, those with a Modified Rankin Scale score of ≥2, and those in a rehabilitation hospital/long-term care ward or who died were significantly higher among patients who presented within 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Less than one fifth of our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients presented to hospital within 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although our results are preliminary given their limited generalisability and the retrospective nature of data collection, medical rather than social factors were found to be associated with time of presenting to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe symptoms presented to the hospital at an earlier stage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is important to promote the earliest possible presentation to hospital after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
