<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We describe our therapeutic strategy and correlate the anatomic results and clinical outcomes in patients who received immediate fibrinolytic therapy for thromboembolic complications occurring during endovascular treatment of an intracerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records and angiographic examinations of 19 patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> endovascular procedures were performed with the patients under general anesthesia and fully heparinized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients received an intravenous bolus injection of aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thromboemboli occurred during catheterization or insertion of embolic material (Guglielmi detachable coils or mechanical detachable spirals) or in the first hours after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clot distribution was within the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in 14 patients, the ACA in three patients, and the basilar trunk in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A continuous intraarterial injection of urokinase was administered immediately, either superselectively distal to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> or selectively within or closely proximal to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nine cases, chemical lysis was combined with mechanical clot fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial anatomic recanalization as well as clinical outcome at 3 months were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients showed complete recanalization and nine patients showed partial recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had a good clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient was moderately disabled and two were severely disabled according to their scores on the Glasgow outcome scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients died, one as a consequence of the preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and the other because of a large intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> that developed after fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 patients with a good clinical outcome, nine exhibited complete recanalization and five partial recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pharmacological thrombolysis seems to be a safe and efficient therapy that facilitates the natural fibrinolytic process, increasing the rate of recanalization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Clot fragmentation and superselective drug infusion appear to improve the rate of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization increases the chance of a better clinical outcome; however, clinical outcome does not always correspond to recanalization and vice versa </plain></SENT>
