<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To classify transcranial Doppler (TCD) spectral patterns and analyze the significance of the patterns in the determination of hemodynamic alterations occurring during filter-protected carotid artery stent (CAS) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) monitoring and post-CAS diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) were reviewed for 53 patients (45 men; mean age 67.6 Â± 8.3 years) who underwent TCD evaluation before CAS and TCD monitoring during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TCD spectral patterns were classified according to the hemodynamic changes that occurred after different portions of the CAS procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationships among the spectral patterns and the frequency and location of new DWMRI lesions were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TCD spectral changes were classified into 4 patterns: (1) microemboli signals (53, 100%), (2) right-left collateral signals (31/53, 58%), (3) spectral suppression after balloon inflation (31/44, 70%), and (4) continuous spectral suppression after balloon removal (4/44, 9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even though microembolic signals were frequently observed during CAS, the new DWMRI lesions were more frequently observed outside of the cerebral territory (78%) rather than in the territory ipsilateral to CAS (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of right-left collaterals was related to less severe balloon-related spectral suppression on ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuous spectral suppression appeared after stent deployment and balloon dilation and was immediately reversed after removal of the filter device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The spectral patterns classified in the present study may prove useful in anticipating CAS procedure-related hemodynamic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Close hemodynamic observation using these spectral patterns could be helpful in preventing serious complications during CAS </plain></SENT>
