<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fear of distal embolization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has aroused concern regarding carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Devices to protect the cerebral circulation may make carotid stenting safer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multidisciplinary study group tested a balloon occlusion-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> emboli entrapment device in conjunction with carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The device consists of an elastomeric balloon on a steerable wire with a detachable adapter that inflates and deflates the distal temporary occlusion balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> catheter is used to remove trapped emboli after stenting and before occlusion balloon deflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-five patients with severe internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were treated with stents deployed with this cerebrovasculature protection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 75 patients (100%) had grossly visible particulate material aspirated, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were treated successfully without major or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preintervention stenosis was 81+/-10%, and residual stenosis was 5+/-7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (12%) had angiographic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> before intervention, but no patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> or vessel cutoff after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients (5%) developed transient neurological symptoms during protection balloon occlusion, but symptoms resolved with balloon deflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 22 to 667 particles aspirated per patient ranged from 3.6 to 5262 microm in maximum diameter (mean, 203+/-256 microm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These particles included fibrous plaque debris, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> or cholesterol vacuoles, and calcific plaque fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Protected carotid stenting was performed successfully and safely in this study early in the experience with cerebrovascular protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Particulate emboli are frequent with stenting, and cerebral protection will likely be necessary to minimize <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Randomized trials comparing protected carotid stenting with endarterectomy are warranted </plain></SENT>
