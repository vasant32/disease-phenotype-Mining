<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and echocardiographic risk factors have a relevant risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is little knowledge about the long-term fate and the rate of clinical silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> under continued oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to assess the prognosis of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and determine a high-risk group with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> under oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 173 consecutive patients with persistent or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and left atrial (LA) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, dense spontaneous echocontrast, reduced LA appendage peak emptying velocities, or a combination of these were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 169 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and without echocardiographic risk factors served as control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed serial and prospective transesophageal echocardiography, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical examinations during a period of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period 7 (4%) of the patients at high risk had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 4 (2%) patients died because of embolic events and 19 (11%) patients had silent embolism as documented on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group, 10 (6%) patients had embolic events documented on magnetic resonance imaging; one was clinically apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Study patients with an event had more often previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with persistent or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and LA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, dense spontaneous echocontrast, or reduced LA appendage peak emptying velocities have an explicitly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (17%) despite oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Previous thromboembolic event is another important predictor for an event </plain></SENT>
