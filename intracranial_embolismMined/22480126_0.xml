<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hydatid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> can develop in any segment or organ, but the most frequent locations are liver and lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mediastinal hydatid lesions are extremly rare and only a few cases exists in the medical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Between 1994 and 2011 Thoracic Surgery Clinic, UMF "Carol Davila" there were 3 patients diagnosed and surgical trated for hydatid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> of mediastinum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were 2 men and 1 woman aged of 20, 37 and 52 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hydatid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were located in the anterior mediastinum and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were solitary lesions when diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 1 case the positive diagnosis was made preoperatively, in the other 2 the diagnosis was intraoperative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The approach was through thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> was complicated (nonviable thymic hydatid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath>), treated by ideal cystectomy, and 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were viable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was 1 postoperative complication: gaseous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> remitted after medical treatment, caused by the intraoperative use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> as scolicide agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although very rare, anterior mediastinal hydatid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> must be considered in every patient with anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240318" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinal mass</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice; surgery followed by parasiticide therapy provides complete cure </plain></SENT>
