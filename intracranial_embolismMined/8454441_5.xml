<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> post-surgical patient is frequently difficult and therefore the initiation of specific therapy is often delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only limited information is currently available on the effects of delayed HBO treatment in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recently used HBO to treat five patients with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> resulting from invasive medical procedures; hyperbaric treatment was begun 15-60 h after the embolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> were: cardiopulmonary bypass accidents, pulmonary barotrauma induced by mechanical ventilation, and central vein catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received initial treatment according to U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Navy Compression Table 6A in a multiplace chamber, followed by subsequent treatments with 100% O2 at 2.5 to 2.8 ATA for 90 min as indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant, partial or complete recovery was observed in three patients, one patient did not respond, and one died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The salutary effects of HBO in our subgroup of patients suggest that this treatment should be used in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> even when referral to a hyperbaric facility is delayed </plain></SENT>
