<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the site of the ischemic lesion, the underlying cause, and the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with distal arm <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The authors investigated 14 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> distal arm <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> with a diagnostic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> protocol and early MRI, including T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images (DWI), and perfusion-weighted images (PWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> DWI lesions were shown on coregistered T2-weighted images for analysis of the exact anatomic lesion location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients showed a uniform (7/14), radial (3/14), or ulnar (4/14) distribution of hand <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, DWI identified small lesions located in the motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Topographic lesion analysis, which was correlated with the clinical deficit, showed lesions centered in the hand knob area (2/14), involving the lateral (6/14), medial (4/14), or both (2/14) borders of the hand knob </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PWI (calculated time-to-peak maps) did not show a mismatch between the DWI lesion and the PWI lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six patients, DWI and PWI lesions were identical in size and location; no definite perfusion deficit was seen in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In agreement with PWI, no patient showed clinical worsening, and six patients recovered completely within a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further investigations showed a potential source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> ischemic distal arm <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> is usually caused by a small cortical lesion in the motor hand cortex attributable to distal Rolandic artery obstruction without additional tissue at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm the observed benign clinical course and its apparent main cause (artery-to-artery or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
