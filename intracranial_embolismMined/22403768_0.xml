<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We describe the first-in-human experience with a novel cerebral embolic protection device used during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One current challenge of TAVI is the reduction of procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Procedural mobilisation of debris is a known source of cerebral embolisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mechanical protection by transient filtration of cerebral blood flow might reduce the embolic burden during TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the Claret CE Pro™ cerebral protection device in patients undergoing TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients scheduled for TAVI were prospectively enrolled at three centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Claret CE Pro™ (Claret Medical, Inc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Santa Rosa, CA, USA) cerebral protection device was placed via the right radial/brachial artery prior to TAVI and was removed after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was technical success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints encompassed procedural and 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates, as well as device-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deployment of the Claret CE Pro™ cerebral protection device was intended for use in 40 patients, 35 devices were implanted into the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Technical success rate with delivery of the proximal and distal filter was 60% for the first generation device and 87% for the second-generation device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Delivery times for the first-generation device were 12.4±12.1 minutes and 4.4 ± 2.5 minutes for the second-generation device (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The quantity of contrast used related to the Claret CE Pro System was 19.6 ± 3.8 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Captured debris was documented in at least 19 of 35 implanted devices (54.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No procedural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e>, minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day follow-up showed one minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurring 30 days after the procedure, and two major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> both occurring well after the patient had completed TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of the Claret CE Pro™ system is feasible and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Capture of debris in more than half of the patients provides evidence for the potential to reduce the procedural cerebral embolic burden utilising this dedicated filter system during TAVI </plain></SENT>
