<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Selected patient groups have a high incidence of such signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases to identify the incidence of Doppler emboli in different etiologic subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients presenting with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler examination of both middle cerebral arteries, carotid color duplex ultrasound, and transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography were completed within 48 hours of deficit <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and imaging data were interpreted independent of emboli data, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology was classified according to recent multicenter trial criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Middle cerebral artery signals were identified in at least one cerebral hemisphere in 41 of the 45 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Emboli signals were present in 29 of these 41 cases (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These signals were bilateral in 22, within the affected (symptomatic) cerebral hemisphere only in 5, and contralateral only in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No emboli signals were detected in any of 8 patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall difference in emboli signal counts between etiologic subgroups was significant (P = .001, Kruskal-Wallis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher emboli signal count was found within affected cerebral hemispheres than contralaterally in the 8 patients with large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (11.3 versus 1 signals per hour, median [95% confidence interval, 3 to 40 and 0 to 3, respectively], P = .02), but this interhemisphere difference was not present for other etiologic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Emboli signals are common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with the notable exception of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the small vessel etiology for the latter group and provides support for the relevance of Doppler emboli signal detection in thromboembolic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
