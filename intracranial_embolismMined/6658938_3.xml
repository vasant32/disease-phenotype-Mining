<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of radioactive microspheres as embolic agents enabled the number of microspheres to be determined in each cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> was assessed 24 h after embolization by measuring brain water, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Equiosmolal doses (40 mmol/kg) of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> were injected i.p. at various times before sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both treatments caused similar changes in water and electrolyte content, brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> being maximal 30 min after <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> and 2 h after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral energy metabolism and regional blood flow were evaluated at the times of maximal brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">Urea</z:chebi> treatment resulted in an improvement of the cerebral circulation whereas <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> treatment led to a deterioration of cerebral blood flow which cannot be explained by failure to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and the consequent microcirculatory impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">Urea</z:chebi> treatment had no marked effect on cerebral energy metabolism whereas <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> injection resulted in an important increase in brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level which may be relevant to the impairment of cerebral reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results point out that administration of a metabolized solute like <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> may exert deleterious effects on the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
