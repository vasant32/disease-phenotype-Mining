<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral embolism</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are feared complications of left atrial catheter ablation such as pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to assess the thrombogenicity of left atrial catheter ablation, knowledge of both clinically evident as well as silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to examine the use of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, apparent as well as silent, caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> undergoing lasso catheter-guided ostial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ablation using an irrigated-tip ablation catheter were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral MRI including DW single-shot spin echo echoplanar, turbo fluid attenuated inversion recovery, and T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequences were performed the day after the ablation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients also underwent preprocedure cerebral MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ablation procedures were performed without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A mean of 3.2 +/- 0.6 PVs were ablated per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient had neurological symptoms following the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 2 of 20 patients (10%), DW-MRI revealed new embolic lesions, which were located in the right periventricular white matter in one and in the left temporal lobe in the other patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in age, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, left atrial volume, and procedure duration between the 2 patients with and the 18 patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> following AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study using highly sensitive DW-MRI of the brain to detect asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> after left atrial catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Even small, clinically silent, embolic lesions can be demonstrated with this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI can be used to monitor and compare the thrombogenicity of different AF ablation approaches </plain></SENT>
