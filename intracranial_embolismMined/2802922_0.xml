<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three cases of spontaneous intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the posterior fossa were operated upon, and the diagnosis of thrombosed vascular malformation was histologically confirmed in two of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So-called "angiographically occult" vascular malformations often present characteristic magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images, namely, iso- to high intensity signal core surrounded by a low intensity signal rim or area on both T1 and T2 weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such findings are thought to indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> has a relatively short T1 and long T2 relaxation times, resulting in an area of relatively increased signal intensity, and that hemosiderin deposits apparently decrease T2 relaxation time by paramagnetic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most such lesions do not show significant perifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, however, perifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> may be seen as in our Case 3, and the differential diagnosis from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, particularly <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, may become difficult even with the recent technical standards of high resolution CT and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reasons responsible for non-visualization of such vascular malformations at angiography are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small size of the lesion, slow blood flow through it, compression by adjacent clot or gliotic scar, spontaneous or secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with hyalin degeneration, and destruction at its rupture are possible factors </plain></SENT>
