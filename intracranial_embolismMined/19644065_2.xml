<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The typical lesion patterns and the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with concurrent stenoses are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> features of such patients in Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study in a university hospital from January 2002 to December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consecutive Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> underwent CT brain, MRI brain (with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences), and carotid duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 251 patients were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 109 (43%) had concurrent stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who had concurrent stenoses, as compared with those without concurrent stenoses, had more symptomatic stenoses (84% versus 58%; OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.1 to 7.3; P&lt;0.001), more concomitant perforating artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, pial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and borderzone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (14% versus 4%; OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 9.7; P=0.007), more multiple diffusion-weighted imaging lesions (55% versus 37%; OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.4; P=0.005), and more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the territory of the leptomeningeal branches of middle cerebral artery (26% versus 13%; OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.3; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analysis, smoking; prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; the presence of concomitant pial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, pial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and borderzone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; multiple diffusion-weighted imaging lesions; and symptomatic stenoses were significantly associated with concurrent stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with concurrent stenoses, those who had tandem lesions, as compared with those who had nontandem lesions, had more perforating artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and borderzone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (27% versus 8%; OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 0.9 to 19.8; P=0.04); more concomitant pial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, pial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and borderzone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (18% versus 0%; P=0.02), and more multiple diffusion-weighted imaging lesions (65% versus 23%; OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.2 to 17.2; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> in the territory of middle cerebral artery leptomeningeal branches and symptomatic stenoses were more common in patients with tandem lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant perforating artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, pial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and borderzone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; multiple diffusion-weighted imaging lesions, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the leptomeningeal branches of the middle cerebral artery were more common in patients with concurrent stenoses, especially those with tandem lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study suggested that the combination of hemodynamic compromise attributable to concurrent stenoses and artery-to-artery embolization is a common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism in these patients </plain></SENT>
