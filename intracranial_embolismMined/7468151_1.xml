<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate this phenomenon platelet aggregation and fibrinolytic activity were studied in 29 alcoholic males under 50 years of age who showed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age matched healthy nonalcoholic volunteers made up the control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation did not differ significantly (P greater than 0.05) in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolytic activity was significantly reduced in the alcoholics as compared to the controls (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the alcoholics have an increased thrombotic tendency </plain></SENT>
