<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Decision analysis using a Markov-chain technique and quality-adjusted life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatient clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients aged 40-80 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: The following strategies were studied: 1) obtain echocardiograms for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and anticoagulate those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo>; 2) anticoagulate patients with classic auscultatory sounds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> and obtain echocardiograms for patients with other murmurs; if an echocardiogram reveals <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo>, anticoagulate; 3) anticoagulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with murmurs; 4) anticoagulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; 5) observe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (natural history) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: The base analysis, using data available in the literature and on site, indicated that though performing echocardiography on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> gave the best quality-adjusted life expectancy, the differences among the five strategies studied were small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, sensitivity analysis revealed that the decision was sensitive to many of the variables used in the analysis, especially the efficacy and the risks of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A recommendation that cardiac ultrasonography be done for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in order to detect clinically unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> cannot be made </plain></SENT>
