<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing prosthetic valve insertion and coronary artery bypass surgery were examined with transcranial Doppler ultrasound, recently shown to be capable of detecting continuing subclinical emboli in patients with embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 30 patients examined at least 1 year after valve surgery, and in whom warfarinisation was stable within defined limits, 20 of 24 patients (83%) with mechanical valves and 3 of 6 patients (50%) with porcine valves had embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a serial preoperative and postoperative study in a further 30 patients, of whom 29 had native or bioprosthetic valves, only the one patient with a previous mechanical mitral valve prosthesis had embolic signals preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of embolic signals increased to 9 (30%) on the first postoperative day, and 20 (67%) on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a similar serial study in 25 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery, 8 (32%) had preoperative embolic signals, which were explicable by cardiac and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> signal incidence and count did not increase postoperatively in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No embolic signals were found in 15 volunteer controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that prosthetic valves cause continuing microembolisation, detectable by transcranial Doppler; coronary artery bypass cases may have incidental embolic signals which are unaffected by cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This new application of Doppler ultrasound may improve the clinical assessment of embolic risk of new prosthetic valve types and deserves further examination </plain></SENT>
