<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Early computed tomography (CT) signs are crucial to predict the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and are preventive to avoid a fatal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients receiving heparinization to investigate the correlation between early CT signs and the frequency of HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 96 patients with cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were admitted within 24 h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and were subsequently given 5000-15,000 units of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> per day for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Owing to CT on admission, early CT changes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics were also estimated, including evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and history of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of hemorrhagic transformation, or good outcome and independence was assessed by backward stepwise logistic regression analysis based on the maximum likelihood ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score, early CT signs and absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> diversely correlated with the occurrence of HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, the presence or absence of early CT signs was significantly related to HT classification (Ï‡(2)-test; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was statistically significant that a higher baseline NIHSS score (OR 8.51; 95% CI 3.11-27.75) affected the outcome without showing a significant relationship to early CT signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Presence of early CT signs correlated more strongly with HT than with the interval from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to hospital arrival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We might extend the therapeutic time for thrombolytic therapy, only if the early CT sign does not appear </plain></SENT>
