<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Jude valves were implanted in 155 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While 141 patients received one valve, 95 in the aortic, 45 in the mitral and 1 in the tricuspid position, 14 patients had a double (aortic and mitral) valve replacement </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Jude valve: whereas 81.9% of patients were in NYHA functional class III or IV preoperatively, 87.1% were in class I or II after valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients generally had a slight increase in LDH levels but <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> was responsible for moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> only in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 10 nonfatal neurological accidents, probably due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, resulting in a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> of 4.04% per patient year; 4 of the 10 patients were incompletely anticoagulated and 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
