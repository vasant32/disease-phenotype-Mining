<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of LA infusion on NO formation, vasodilation, and reduction of thromboembolic burden in organs and tissues after CPB was quantified with In-111-labeled autologous platelets in two major groups: 180 minutes CPB (CPB) and 90 minutes CPB plus 90 minutes reperfusion (RP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelets labeled with In-111 tropolone (650-780 ÂµCi) were administered 24 hours before CPB and LA infusion (bolus, 10 mg/kg and infusion at 2 mg/kg/min, 21 pigs for 180 minutes CPB) in 8 groups of 30 Yorkshire pigs (30-35 kg, 6 pigs; LA 2 mg/kg/min, 3 pigs; sham-thoracotomy control, 6 pigs; unoperated control, 6 pigs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups of 9 pigs (control CPB, 6 pigs; LA 2 mg/kg/min, 3 pigs) underwent 90 minutes of CPB and 90 minutes of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pigs were heparinized (ACT &gt; 400 seconds); CPB was instituted with a roller pump, an oxygenator (OX: Bentley Univox, 1.8 m2), and an arterial filter (AF: 0.25 m2, Bentley) at a blood flow of 2.5-3.5 l/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radioactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in OX and AF and emboli in viscera, brain, and connective tissues were imaged with a gamma camera and were finally measured with an ion chamber and a gamma counter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percent of injected platelets (mean +/- SD) in the organs and tissues of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pigs was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral emboli</z:e> were mapped in 25 regions of both hemispheres of pig brain </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral mapping of In-111 platelets showed reduced emboli in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions, including the medulla, hip pocampus, and posterior cerebral cortex in both LA-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry of blood samples demonstrated the shift of equilibria from single platelet to platelet-aggregate-microparticle during CPB and steady-state level after the first 5-10 minutes of initiation of CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> infusion reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and emboli during CPB in the pig model </plain></SENT>
