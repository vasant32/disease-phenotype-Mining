<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between intraoperative cerebral microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) and postoperative neuropsychological deficit in patients with valve replacement (VR) and patients with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neuropsychological examination (10 tests) was performed 1-2 days before and 2 months after surgery (VR (n=26) and CABG (n=14)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intraoperative number of cerebral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were monitored from the right middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A higher number of cerebral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in VR patients with neurological deficit (6/26) compared with those without deficit (20/26) (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> median number 2083 v 645, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No such difference was found in patients with CABG (2/14 v 12/14) (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> median number 50 v 112, p=0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in patients with VR with neuropsychological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with CABG with such a deficit, a low number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference in number may be explained by relatively more gaseous emboli in the first and more solid in the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the results in the patients with CABG should be interpreted with caution due to the few patients in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
