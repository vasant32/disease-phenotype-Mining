<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The intention of minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC) is to reduce priming volume and minimize contact of blood with polymers and air in a closed system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to conventional extracorporeal circulation (ECC), a venous reservoir is missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, air trapping is limited and avoidance of bubble embolism is a major concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigates microbubbles (MBB) number and size in the venous and arterial lines of ECC and MECC compared to the number of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in the right and left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients undergoing coronary surgery were operated either with conventional ECC (cardiotomy reservoir, Rotaflow pump, Quadrox oxygenator, Quart filter) or MECC (Quart filter, Rotaflow pump, Quadrox oxygenator) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Number and size of MBB were monitored in the venous and arterial lines with an ultrasound Doppler system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in right and left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing MECC had additional sealing of the venous cannula by a ligature at the site of its insertion into the right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups with respect to age, X-clamping, bypass time and number of distal anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and MBB in the arterial line was comparable between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the venous side, MECC-perfusion shows a significantly lower number of MBB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This could be explained with the additional sealing of the venous cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data indicate that the MBB-volume reaching the pump will also appear in the arterial outflow and into the patient's <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For this reason, the avoidance of air contamination is a major concern for surgeons, anaesthesiologists and perfusionists </plain></SENT>
