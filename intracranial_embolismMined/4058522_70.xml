<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We determined the long-term prognosis for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral-valve prolapse</z:hpo> documented by echocardiography by following 237 minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic patients for a mean of 6.2 years (range, 1 to 10.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The actuarial eight-year probability of survival was 88 per cent, which is not significantly different from that for a matched control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An initial left ventricular diastolic dimension exceeding 60 mm was the best echocardiographic predictor of the subsequent need for mitral-valve replacement (17 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 97 patients with redundant mitral-valve leaflets identified echocardiographically, 10 (10.3 per cent) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, or a cerebral embolic event; in contrast, of the 140 patients with nonredundant valves, only 1 (0.7 per cent) had such complications (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients with echocardiographic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral-valve prolapse</z:hpo> have a benign course, but subsets at high risk for the development of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, cerebral embolic events, or infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> can be identified by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
