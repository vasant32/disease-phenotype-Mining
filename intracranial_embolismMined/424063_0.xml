<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study analysed the clinical course, the serial angiograms and the CT scans of the patients with angiographic <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> following vasospasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occlusion was observed in 6 out of 84 patients with vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The angiograms which showed this phenomenon were obtained between the 11th and the 30th day of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The affected vessels were the branches of middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between antifibrinolytic therapy and this phenomenon except in one case </plain></SENT>
