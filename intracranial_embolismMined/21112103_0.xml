<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of cerebrovascular events associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in a large population of patients during mid-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively investigated 446 consecutive patients (58% female, age 50 Â± 14 years) in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was detected by contrast echocardiography following cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (30.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 23.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>(10.5%) or evaluation for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e>(35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of other clinical conditions potentially associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were 31%, 12.5%, 11.2%, respectively; 99 out of 446 patients (22%, group 1) underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure, shortly after diagnosis, while 347 (78%, group 2) received only medical therapy (antiplatelet drugs and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 54 months (range 12-96) of average follow-up few events had been observed: one fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1%) in group 1 and 3 nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (0.86%) in group 2 (not significant); there were more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in group 1 than in group 2 (5, 5% versus 3, 0.86%, p=0.02): 8/12 new cerebrovascular events occurred in patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and in 7/12 there were other cardioembolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival free from cerebrovascular events showed a slightly better prognosis in unclosed <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> patients compared to closed <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> ones, statistically significant (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: New cerebrovascular events are rare in unselected subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, even in those with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and those who have not undergone <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure, with an event rate similar to that observed in the general population </plain></SENT>
