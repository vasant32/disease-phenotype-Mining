<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is frequently administered clinically as thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We injected recombinant t-PA into rats with cerebral 125I-labeled blood clot emboli to evaluate the dissolutive effect of recombinant human single-chain t-PA (rt-PA; TD-2061) on such emboli and to examine the possibility of improving neurological damage in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When rt-PA was given intravenously at a dose of 350,000 IU/kg 2 minutes before embolization, radioactivity in the affected cerebral hemisphere decreased to 20% of that in the vehicle control 2 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in radioactivity in the cerebral hemisphere was also found on the administration of 700,000 IU/kg of rt-PA 30 or 60 minutes after embolization, but not when rt-PA was administered 2 minutes after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marked inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0004924'>abnormal behavior</z:mp> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> was seen on treatment with rt-PA 2 minutes before embolization, but not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> when rt-PA treatment was given 30 or 60 minutes after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that rt-PA can dissolve blood clot emboli in cerebral vessels and that prompt thrombolytic therapy is important to minimize neurological dysfunction in cases of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
