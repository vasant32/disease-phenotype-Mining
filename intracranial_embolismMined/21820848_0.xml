<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome (CFES) was retrospectively investigated among 2345 simultaneous bilateral TKA procedures performed from August 2006 to May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During that period, 9 patients presented with neurologic deficits after surgery and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For identification of CFES among them, we used both magnetic resonance imaging findings and clinical criteria modified from the original one of Gurd and Wilson (J Bone Joint Surg Br 1974; 56B:408) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients fulfilled the modified criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of CFES occurring after simultaneous bilateral TKA was 0.17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome should be ruled out, although rare, in patients who present with neurologic impairment after TKA </plain></SENT>
