<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such data have not been available until recently for Southeastern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, during the last decades, strategies for the modification of risk factors and primary prevention may have changed the prevalence of each subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated 1, 042 consecutive patients who had first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, during a period of 5 years (from June 1992 to May 1997) and classified them prospectively based on etiopathogenic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 613 male and 429 female patients, with a mean age of 70.2 +/- 11.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six percent of the patients arrived within 3 h from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probable mechanisms were: large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, 156 (15%); lacunes, 177 (17%); cardioembolic, 335 (32.1%); <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of unknown cause, 182 (17.5%); miscellaneous causes, 35 (3.3%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), 157 (15.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cardioembolic group, nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (NVAF) was the probable cause in 225 patients, especially in patients older than 75 years (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall hospital mortality was 15.2% (from 0.6% for lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to 34% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our population, cardioembolism is the most frequent subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NVAF is the most likely source, especially in older patients </plain></SENT>
