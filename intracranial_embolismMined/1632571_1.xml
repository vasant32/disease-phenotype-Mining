<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated microcirculatory changes in cerebral embolization induced by an injection of glass beads (mesh size 20/400, 15 mg/body) using intravital microscopy and reflectance spectrophotometry in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral embolization with the glass bead injection reduced the inner diameter of cerebral arterioles, the index of cerebral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration (IHb), and the index of oxygen saturation (ISO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, platelet aggregation rates and plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi>) and 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">prostaglandin F1 alpha</z:chebi> (6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>) appreciably increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During observation of the pial vasculature, "white bodies" became visible at the entrance of arteriolar branchings two to three minutes after the glass bead injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> administration (3 mg/kg, IV), they could not observe white bodies, and platelet aggregation rates were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> and 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> were also significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that glass beads do injury to the microvascular endothelial cells leading to development of white bodies, ie, "flying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>." Therefore, the cerebral microvascular embolization induced by the glass bead injection appears to be an experimental model for evaluating efficacy of remedies for the cerebral microcirculatory disorders </plain></SENT>
