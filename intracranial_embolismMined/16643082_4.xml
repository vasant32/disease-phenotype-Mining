<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report a case of successful stenting after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 75-year-old man presented with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of right-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and difficulty speaking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imaging revealed an occlusion of the left petrous to lacerum internal carotid artery (ICA) segment and slightly decreased cerebral blood flow in the left hemisphere; there were stenoses of the ostial and cavernous ICA segments on the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the seventh day after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, he underwent protected carotid angioplasty of the left intracranial ICA occlusion to reduce the high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> owing to bilateral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An external arteriovenous shunt was established with an occluding balloon in the proximal ICA and a filter in the femoral vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After protected balloon dilation of the ICA occlusion, a 3.5 x 18-mm balloon-expandable coronary stent was deployed across the residual stenotic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An intraluminal filling defect of the petrous ICA segment suggested an <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> or intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, so another 2 coronary stents were deployed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Macroscopically visible materials were captured in the filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient had a good clinical course and was discharged without neurological deficits on the twelfth day after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiography at 3 months confirmed no restenosis of the stented vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This experience suggests that short atherothrombotic intracranial ICA occlusions can be opened in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> stage without distal migration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> under proximal protection and flow reversal </plain></SENT>
