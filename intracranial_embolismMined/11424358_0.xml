<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and ten patients with cerebrovascular occlusive diseases including 6 of IC occlusion and 4 of post EC/IC bypass surgery underwent time-resolved projection MRA on a 1.5 T clinical MRI system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Projection angiograms are acquired with 2 D-fast SPGR sequence with a time resolution of approximately one image per second, 40 images being acquired consecutively before and after bolus injection Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> images were calculated by complex subtraction from the background mask in a work station </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers, the quality of images of time-resolved projection MRA was satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The arteries from internal carotid artery through M 2 segment of middle cerebral artery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major venous systems were well portrayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases of IC occlusion who were assessed the collateral flow through the anterior communicating artery and posterior communicating artery, there were delayed to demonstrate the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in 2 cases of IC occlusion that were assessed the collateral flow through leptomeningeal anastomosis, ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and collateral circulation were not demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients of post EC/IC bypass surgery, the patency of EC/IC bypass could be evaluated as properly with time-resolved projection MRA as 3 D-TOF MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the temporal and spatial resolutions are insufficient, time-resolved projection MRA was powerful non-invasive method to evaluate the cerebral hemodynamics via the basal communicating arteries in IC occlusion and identify the patency of EC/IC bypass </plain></SENT>
