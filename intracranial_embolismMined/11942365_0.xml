<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a case of transcortical mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> caused by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 77-year-old right-handed man was admitted to our hospital with speech disturbance and a right hemianopia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His spontaneous speech was remarkably reduced, and object naming, word fluency, comprehension, reading and writing were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> severely disturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, repetition of phonemes and sentences and reading aloud were fully preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the left frontal and parieto-occipital lobe which included the inferior frontal gyrus and angular gyrus, single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT revealed a wider area of low perfusion over the entire left hemisphere except for part of the left perisylvian language areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="19" ids="2673">amytal</z:chebi> (Wada) test, which was performed via the left internal carotid artery, revealed that the left hemisphere was dominant for language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, it appears that transcortical mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> may be caused by the isolation of perisylvian speech areas, even if there is a lesion in the inferior frontal gyrus, due to disconnection from surrounding areas </plain></SENT>
