<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evidence suggests that dietary calcium is protective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report examines whether the effect has an influence on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1965, the Honolulu Heart Program has followed a cohort of men in a study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report examines the effect of baseline dietary calcium and milk intake on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in 22 years of follow-up in 3150 older middle-aged men (55 to 68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Men who were nondrinkers of milk experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at twice the rate (P &lt; .05) of men who consumed 16 oz/d or more (7.9 versus 3.7 per 100, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> decreased with increasing milk intake (P &lt; .05), the decline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk with increased consumption was modest for those who consumed under 16 oz/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intake of dietary calcium was also associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P &lt; .01), although its association was confounded with milk consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calcium intake from nondairy sources was not related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, suggesting that other constituents or covariates related to milk consumption may be important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that an association between milk consumption and a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in older middle-aged men cannot be explained by intake of dietary calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since milk is often part of a diverse pattern of dietary intake, it is difficult to determine whether milk consumption has a direct role in reducing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data suggest that consumption of milk in older middle age is not harmful, and when combined with a balanced diet, weight control, and physical activity, reductions in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may occur </plain></SENT>
