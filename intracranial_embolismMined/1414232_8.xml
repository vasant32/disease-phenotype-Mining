<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have measured PAF-AH activity in red blood cells (RBCs) from patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activities in 34 patients and 34 controls were 1.29 +/- 0.28 and 1.64 +/- 0.26 nmol/10(9) RBCs/min (or, 30.0 +/- 5.8 and 35.1 +/- 4.7 nmol/g protein/min) (mean +/- SD), respectively, and the difference was significant (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients, RBC PAF-AH activity correlated positively with RBC filterability, an index of RBC deformability (r = +0.501, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RBC activity may play a role in scavenging oxidation products of membrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lower RBC PAF-AH activity may predispose to ischemic diseases by disturbing microcirculatory behavior of the RBCs </plain></SENT>
