<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who could receive drug treatment within 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of ebselen granules suspended in water (150 mg BID) or placebo was started immediately after admission and was continued for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major end points were the Glasgow Outcome Scale scores at 1 month and 3 months after the start of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The modified Mathew Scale and modified Barthel Index scores at 1 month and 3 months were also studied as secondary outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred two patients were enrolled in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intent-to-treat analysis of 300 patients (151 given ebselen and 149 given placebo) revealed that ebselen treatment achieved a significantly better outcome than placebo at 1 month (P = .023, Wilcoxon rank sum test) but not at 3 months (P = .056, Wilcoxon rank sum test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The improvement was significant in patients who started ebselen within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> but not in those who started treatment after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a corresponding improvement in the modified Mathew Scale and modified Barthel Index scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with ebselen improved the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ebselen may be a promising neuroprotective agent </plain></SENT>
