<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study showed that EEG findings are particularly misleading when the lesions were in the locations as follows: 1) subcortical deep infarctions, 2) cortical infarctions occupying a small proportion of cerebral convexity, or involving an entire hemisphere, or affecting the right hemisphere, 3) basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and infratentorial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (primary or secondary to supratentorial lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological significance of these results has been discussed </plain></SENT>
