<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In three patients with a cerebrovascular event the diagnosis was established by the transesophageal approach only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interatrial shunting on transthoracic imaging with use of echocardiographic contrast imaging or Doppler color mapping, or both, was detected in 7 (41%) of 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On performing contrast imaging in combination with color flow mapping during transesophageal echocardiography, positive shunting was demonstrated in 15 (83%) of 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic identification of multiple fenestrations (n = 4) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (n = 2) could be achieved for the first time by transesophageal ultrasound application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular events occurred in 12 (52%) of 23 patients and were regarded as being definitely thromboembolic in 10 (43%); 8 (67%) of the 12 patients had repeated cerebral events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> in one patient, no other potential cardiac source of embolism could be identified despite the use of transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A thickening of the aneurysmal membrane greater than or equal to 5 mm was found in 9 (75%) of 12 patients with versus 3 (27%) of 11 patients without a cerebrovascular event (p less than 0.05); this proved to be the only significant difference between the two patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of embolization may be both primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and paradoxic embolization through an interatrial communication as demonstrated by the findings in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> with thromboembolic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with this lesion and a history of an embolic event, long-term <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy is indicated </plain></SENT>
