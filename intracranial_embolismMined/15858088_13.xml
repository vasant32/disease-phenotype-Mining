<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the extent of vessel wall damage caused by cerebral protection devices designed for carotid angioplasty by using ex vivo porcine carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The local animal experimentation committee did not require its approval for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a benchtop vascular model (flow rate, 470 mL/min; dicrotic pulsatile flow, 76 pulses per minute; pressure, 115/67 mm Hg [mean pressure, 91 mm Hg]) into which 85 porcine internal carotid arteries (ICAs) were inserted, five different protection devices (Angioguard [Cordis/Johnson &amp; Johnson, Miami, Fla], Filterwire EX [Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass], Trap [Microvena, White Bear Lake, Minn], Neuroshield [Abbott Laboratories, Redwood City, Calif], and Percusurge [Abbott Laboratories]) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adverse movement (1 cm up, 2 cm down, and 1 cm up again) of the activated devices (deployed filters or inflated balloons [Percusurge only]) was simulated, and the device was retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each of these steps (deployment, movement, retrieval) the amount of debris from the vessel wall in the effluent of the ICA was determined by using a 100-microm filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Mann-Whitney test was used to test for differences, and a correction for multiple comparisons was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>P &lt; .05 was considered to indicate a significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors attempted to determine whether there was a notable association between the total amount of debris captured and the classification of damage at microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carotid arteries were analyzed histologically with light and scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> examined protection devices caused dislodged debris, which was captured in the effluent filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences among the devices in terms of the total amount of debris captured in the filters (lowest amounts of debris, 4.75 mg [Angioguard] and 5.02 mg [Filterwire EX]; highest amount, 7.51 mg [Trap]; P &lt; or = .001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> devices caused histologically visible wall damage, with the degree of intimal denudation correlating with the mass of the debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Trap device caused the most severe intimal and subintimal wall damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Adverse movement resulted in no increased debris dislodgment as compared with the debris dislodged during deployment and retrieval of the devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the basis of the data obtained, cerebral protection devices themselves have a potential influence on embolization rates by causing debris to be dislodged during carotid stent placement </plain></SENT>
