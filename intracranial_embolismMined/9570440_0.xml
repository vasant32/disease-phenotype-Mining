<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no data available on the prevalence of ulcerations located at the origin of these vessels in the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this pathological study the topographic distribution of ulcerated lesions were determined in these arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and one consecutively autopsied patients composed the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ulcerated plaques were sought for in both carotid arteries, from their origin in the arch up to the carotid canal, and also in the aortic arch and ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two anatomical sites mostly affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were the region of the carotid sinus and the orifices of cervical arteries in the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than one third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were at the orifices of cervical arteries in the arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> at the orifice of the left common carotid artery in the arch were accompanied with other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> located elsewhere in the remaining segments of the left carotid system, whereas ulcerations at the orifice of brachiocephalic trunk were not accompanied with other concomitant lesions in the right carotid system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no symmetric distribution of ulcerated plaques in both carotid systems </plain></SENT>
