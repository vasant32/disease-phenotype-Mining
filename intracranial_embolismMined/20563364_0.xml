<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed TTE reports and hospital records of patients diagnosed with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), screening for potential cardiac sources of embolism (CSE) from January 2006 to December 2008 at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by considering at least 15 predefined TTE criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic interventions employed as a consequence of the TTE findings were sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analyzed 240 patients (mean patient age 58.514) out of 10563 TTEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While only one patient exhibited a definite CSE on TTE, potential CSEs were found in 35 patients (14.6%), most commonly caused by left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (31.4%), followed by LV regional wall motion abnormalities (25.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed 2 independent predictors for identifying a CSE on TTE: history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 6.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]:2.6-14.8, p=0.0001), and nationality (OR 0.16, 95% CI: 0.3-0.7, p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TTE findings affected therapy in only 3 patients (1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The TTE performed to exclude a CSE in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> resulted in low diagnostic yield, and had little impact on therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future refinement of clinical strategies to predict a CSE is needed to improve diagnosis, and possibly cost-effectiveness, of TTE </plain></SENT>
