<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were obtained serially at 2 hours, 1 and 4 days, and 1, 2, and 3 weeks after embolization with 0.05 mL of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53753">triolein</z:chebi> into the internal carotid artery in 19 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Any abnormal signal intensity and change in the signal intensity were evaluated on T2-weighted images, T1-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images (DWIs; including apparent diffusion coefficient [<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>] maps), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced T1-weighted images (Gd-T1WI) over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging at 3 weeks, brain tissue was obtained and evaluated for light microscopic (LM) examination using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin and Luxol fast blue staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For electron microscopic examination, the specimens were obtained at the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histologic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The embolization lesions showed hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, hyperintensity, or isointensity on DWIs, hypointensity, or isointensity on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps and contrast enhancement on Gd-T1WIs at 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The T2-weighted hyperintensity extended to the white matter at day 1 and decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contrast enhancement decreased continuously from day 1, and hyperintensity on DWI decreased after day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hypointensity on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps became less prominent after day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By week 3, most lesions had reverted to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images and were correlated with LM findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, small focal lesions remained in the gray matter of 8 cats and in the white matter of 3 cats on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, and this correlated with the cystic changes on LM findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic examination of the cortical lesions that reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at week 3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images showed that most of these lesions appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> intracapillary fat vacuoles and disruption of the endothelial walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The embolized lesions of the hyperacute stage were of 2 types: type 1 lesions, showing hyperintensity on DWIs and hypointensity on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps, have irreversible sequelae, such as cystic changes; whereas type 2 lesions, showing isointensity or mild hyperintensity on DWIs and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps, reverted to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
