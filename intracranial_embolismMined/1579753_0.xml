<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between April 1972 and May 1990, a total of 300 patients in our institution underwent insertion of a Bj√∂rk-Shiley aortic valve prosthesis, and development of a thrombosed valve was observed only in 4 female cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was considered that the thrombosed valves in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 cases were caused by inadequacy of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As reoperative procedures, thrombectomy, resection of the excessive granulation under the valve, and a method of turning the opening direction of the valve 180 degrees were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These procedures were reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One case died late in the day after the operation, while the remaining 3 cases progressed favorably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although control of one of these three cases was favorably maintained after reoperation, a restriction of 43.2 degrees of the opening angle of the valve was again observed by valve-fluoroscopy performed in the 3rd postoperative year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, progress of this patient was observed on an outpatient basis because flow velocity at the position of aortic valve was also within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was shown Doppler's test using ultrasonic waves and the patient showed no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this patient was admitted to our institute due to sudden right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> on May 1990 in the 5th year after reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> due to the recurrent thrombosed valve was diagnosed because a low density in the middle cerebral area was observed by CT, and increase of the opening angle of the valve (compared with that at ambulation) was also noted by valve-fluoroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> remained even though this patient was saved from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
