<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To discriminate metabolic mechanism from neurogenic and myogenic mechanism, complete cerebral venous occlusion model of cat was used to obtain high venous pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In twenty-one anesthetized cats, 0.3 ml of cyanoacrylate were injected into anterior part of SSS to occlude SSS and cortical vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diameter of pial vessels and ICP were measured through the cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An average of ICP was 6.7 +/- 1.8 mmHg before occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 minutes after occlusion ICP was elevated to an average of 10.4 +/- 4.8 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, ICP increased over 20 mmHg in nine animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pial vein dilated immediately after injection of cyanoacrylate and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> rate was 2-55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pial arteriole between 50 microns and 100 microns in diameter was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In early stages, 2-24% contraction of arteriole were observed in fifteen animals and 2-16% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> were observed in six animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In later stages, 1-87% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of arteriole were observed in ten cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten of twelve ( 83%) cases with ICP under 20 mmHg showed contraction of pial arteriole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eight of nine (89%) cases with ICP over 20 mmHg showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of pial arteriole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, the elevation of ICP and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of pial arteriole were observed simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Correlation between ICP and arterial diameter is obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The dominant mechanism of cerebral blood flow control is metabolic, not neurogenic and myogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Increase of ICP, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of vein and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of artery with increasing ICP are consistent with the theory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
