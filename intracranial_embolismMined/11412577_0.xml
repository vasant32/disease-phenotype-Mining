<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk factors determining the appearance of a new cardio-embolic cerebral accident on secondary thrombophylaxis of non-valvular auricular <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> (NVAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Controlled observational study on a series of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53766,53768,53769">acenocoumarol</z:chebi> for a period of 2.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Anticoagulation Unit of the La Paz Hospital and patients from Madrid Area 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 172 patients with NVAF, over 55 and with <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> for at least a year, and who had suffered at least one ischaemic cerebral accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53766,53768,53769">acenocoumarol</z:chebi> and controlled at an INR of 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk factors were determined and the appearance of new cardio-embolic phenomena was watched during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 12 cardio-embolic phenomena were recorded (11 CVA and one peripheral embolism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The univariate study showed there was a significant association between patients who suffered a new ictus and those who suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) and had a history of more than one ictus before the start of the study (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis found that what had independent predictive value was having suffered more than one ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The greatest threat for developing a new ischaemic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> during anticoagulation in NVAF is having a history of two or more previous ictus, as if the tendency to recur was due to these patients having more extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
