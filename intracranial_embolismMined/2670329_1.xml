<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To reduce the risk of disrupting highly degenerated but nonpalpable plaques, we used quantitative ultrasonic techniques to intraoperatively image the ascending aorta in 33 patients (mean age, 71 years) as a guide to selection of cross-clamping or cannulation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional, integrated backscatter images (integration time, 1.6 mu sec) were obtained with a 5-MHz transducer wrapped in a <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> sheath and placed directly on the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant atherosclerotic disease was detected in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Calcified lesions were found in 13 patients, and fibrofatty lesions were found in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four patients undergoing repair of degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, the extent and distribution of ultrasonically delineated regions of calcification and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were confirmed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In eight (24%) patients, the composition, severity, and location of plaques delineated ultrasonically led to selection of alternate cannulation sites without resultant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, ultrasonic tissue characterization sensitively delineates the extent of aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and its use may decrease the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
