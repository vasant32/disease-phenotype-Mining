<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine changes in platelet function during CEA and the antiplatelet effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran 40</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Platelet function was measured by whole-blood flow cytometry in the peripheral arterial blood of patients during CEA and 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The binding index of P-selectin and PAC-1 expression were measured as markers of activation and aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were kept on aspirin 75-150 mg until the day of surgery and received an intravenous bolus of 5000 units unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> before carotid artery clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-intensity transient signals (HITS) in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery were measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography before, during and after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results are presented as median (interquartile range) and statistical significance was determined using the Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients undergoing CEA were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The P-selectin binding index rose significantly from incision (0.9 (0.2-2.7)) after carotid clamping (1.5 (0.6-3.6); P &lt; 0.01), clamp release (1.7 (0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3-3.0); P &lt; 0.01), 1 h after operation (1.5 (0.3-2.6); P &lt; 0.05) and 24 h after operation (1.3 (0.6-2.5); P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PAC-1 binding index increased from incision (0.4 (0.1-0.8)) after carotid clamping (2.0 (0.4-4.2); P &lt; 0.01) and clamp release (1.8 (0.3-2.9); P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring showed an increase in preoperative HITS per 30 min (2 (0-3)) during dissection (8 (1-15); P &lt; 0.05), after clamp release (16 (2-27); P &lt; 0.01) and during recovery (10 (2-29); P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After operation, patients with more than 50 HITS per 30 min were started on an infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran 40</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six patients had a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran 40</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The P-selectin binding index decreased from 1.6 (0.7-1.9) to 0.6 (0.3-1.5) 1 h after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) and 0.1 (0.1-0.2) 24 h after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>PAC-1 expression decreased from 0.4 (0.3-0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>5) to 0.1 (0.1-0.1) 24 h after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significant platelet activation and aggregation occurs during CEA despite the use of antiplatelet treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A simultaneous increase in HITS was demonstrated with TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran 40</z:chebi> was shown to have an antiplatelet effect after CEA; this is further evidence that it may have a role in reducing thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
