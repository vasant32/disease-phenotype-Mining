<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is caused by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether RLS is associated with the occurrence of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Contrast saline transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was performed to detect RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects comprised 23 consecutive sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> patients and 46 age- and gender-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics, including vascular risk factors, were compared between sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RLS was more frequent in the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> group than in controls (48 vs. 17%, p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in other clinical characteristics were seen between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RLS may be a potential cause of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
