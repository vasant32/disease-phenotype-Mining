<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Assessment of left atrial (LA) function by transesophageal echocardiography is useful for detecting patients with a high risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent study showed that the atrium is the main source of brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) in AF patients without overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the possible relationship between LA function and plasma BNP levels in very elderly patients with non-valvular AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-four consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> non-valvular AF (aged, 82+/-6 years) underwent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography and measurement of plasma BNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen AF patients who had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> or echocardiographic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (TE+ group) were compared with 61 AF patients who had no such complications (TE- group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TE+ group demonstrated a lower LA appendage (LAA) velocity and higher plasma BNP level than the TE- group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assessment of variables by multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that BNP was a significant predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between the plasma BNP level and the LAA peak flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present findings would suggest the usefulness of measuring plasma BNP to detect very elderly non-valvular AF patients at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
