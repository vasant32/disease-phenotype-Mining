<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombolytic treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> carries the risk of hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the potential of MRI for prediction of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is explored to identify patients in whom rtPA treatment may provoke such complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (n=9) were submitted to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) clot embolism, followed 3 hours later by intra-arterial infusion of 10 mg/kg rtPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Untreated SHR (n=9) were infused with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI imaging was performed before treatment and included apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), T2, and perfusion mapping and contrast enhancement with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> was studied 3 days later by histological staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clot embolism led to the rapid decline of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> in the territory of the occluded artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue lesion volume derived from <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> imaging increased by 155+/-69% in the untreated animals and by 168+/-87% in the treated animals (P=NS), determined on the histological sections after 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This same lesion growth in both groups indicated absence of therapeutic effect after 3-hour treatment delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic transformations were significantly more frequent in treated SHR (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In untreated rats, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were found in the border zone of the ischemic territory; in treated animals, hemorrhagic transformations occurred in the ischemic core region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>rtPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were predicted by a disturbance of the blood-brain barrier in 3 of 4 animals before treatment by Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> contrast enhancement but not by <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, T2, or perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The region of contrast enhancement colocalized with subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The disturbance of blood-brain barrier but not of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> parameters allows risk assessment for hemorrhagic transformation induced by subsequent thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
