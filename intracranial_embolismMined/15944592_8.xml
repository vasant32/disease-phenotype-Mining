<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distal filter devices may provide cerebral protection by capturing clinically significant debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, they increase procedural time and expense and have their own set of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study was undertaken to identify the clinical factors predictive for the presence or absence of visible debris captured by distal filter devices during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing CAS with use of a distal filter device (n = 279) were prospectively entered into an investigational carotid registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recorded variables were classified as patient-, lesion-, or procedure-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The filter was assessed for visible debris in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined for each variable to predict visible debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ability of each variable to predict the absence of visible debris was assessed by calculating the individual negative predictive value (NPV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Visible debris was present in 169 filters (60.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was an increased risk of visible debris found with several variables (OR, 95% CI): <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (2.9, 1.7 to 5.2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (2.3, 1.4 to 3.9), stent diameter &gt;9 mm (16.6, 9.0 to 30.0), and any neurologic event (4.2, 1.5 to 9.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The NPV failed to exceed 0.80 (80%) for any variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The NPV of the variables with a significantly elevated OR was as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (0.60), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (0.52), stent diameter &gt;9 mm (0.75), and any neurologic event (0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several clinical variables are associated with the presence of visible debris captured by distal filter devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The current study failed to identify any variables capable of consistently predicting the absence of visible debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings support the routine rather than the selective use of cerebral protection during CAS </plain></SENT>
