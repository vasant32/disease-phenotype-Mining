<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neurological change after surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> caused by embolic events is commonly suspected, but direct detection of emboli has not been possible in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) is able to detect emboli, and large numbers of emboli detected in TCD studies have been associated with radiological changes and clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 2-year period, 11 patients were observed to have emboli during routine TCD studies after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The computed tomographic (CT) scans of these patients were reviewed for low-density areas, suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients studied during a 1-year interval (July 1995-July 1996) served as a control group and were reviewed for similar CT findings, and the two groups were compared using Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine of the 11 patients (82%) observed to have emboli developed low-density areas on their CT scans, whereas 30 of the 123 (24%) patients without emboli developed low-density areas on their CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference was significant (P &lt; 0.001, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Credible sources for emboli were readily identified in each of the 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TCD allows detection of emboli after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery, and this detection is strongly associated with CT evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although detection of emboli was relatively rare in this study, rates of emboli occurrence may increase if systematic monitoring is used </plain></SENT>
