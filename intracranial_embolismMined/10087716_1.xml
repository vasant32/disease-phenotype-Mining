<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentations, diagnostic method, operative findings, and postoperative course were also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 20 female and 12 male patients, age range 10 to 60 years (mean 37.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentations included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (56.2%), atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (25.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (18.9), and constitutional symptoms (9.3%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient was essentially asymptomatic and incidentally detected during clinical check-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> made by two dimensional (2-D) echocardiographic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 29 left atrial, 2 right atrial and 1 combined right atrial and right ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 3 postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, two due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> and the other due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
