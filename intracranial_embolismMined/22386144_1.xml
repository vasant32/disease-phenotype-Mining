<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the effects of open (O) and closed (C) cell stents on the size and number of embolic particles generated during carotid artery stenting (CAS) and assess the impact on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Embolic debris from carotid filters after CAS was analyzed using photomicroscopy and imaging software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient comorbidities, preoperative cerebrovascular symptoms, stent type, and outcomes (perioperative major adverse events) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carotid filters from 173 consecutive CAS procedures (O, 125 and C, 48) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 70.9 ± 9.2 years; 58% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean stenosis was 88.2% ± 8.1%; 36.6% had neurological symptoms preprocedurally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in preoperative symptoms between the two groups (O, 38.7% vs C, 31.3%; P = not significant [NS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, closed cell stent use was associated with higher degree of stenosis (O, 87.2% ± 8.0% vs C, 90.6% ± 7.8%; P = .01), an older age (O, 70.0 ± 8.6 years vs C, 73.4 ± 10.2 years; P = .03), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (21.1% vs 43.5%; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A larger mean particle size was observed in patients treated with open cell stents compared to closed cell stents (O, 416.5 ± 335.7 μm vs C, 301.1 ± 251.3 μm; P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the total number of particles (O, 13.8 ± 21.5 vs C, 17.6 ± 19.9; P = NS), periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P = NS), and major adverse events between the two groups (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Open cell stents are associated with a larger mean particle size compared to closed cell stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No impact on procedural outcomes based on stent type was observed </plain></SENT>
