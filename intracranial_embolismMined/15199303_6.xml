<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Blood pressure (BP) management in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains a matter of little consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on BP changes during the first hours of ictus are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the early spontaneous time course of BP in different ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (IS) subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four h BP monitoring was performed in 200 first-ever hyper-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recording was initiated and terminated at 3 h and 27 h of ictus respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> IS patients were classified on admission into the following subgroups of different etiology: large artery atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (LAA), cardio-embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (CE), lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (LAC) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of undetermined cause (IUC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparisons between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subgroups were performed using one-way ANOVA and linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the influence of different factors in BP course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although there were no significant differences in 24 h systolic (SBP) and diastolic (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) BP values between IS subgroups, a distinctly different SBP course was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SBP dropped sharply in the LAA and LAC subgroups, while a more gradual decrease was monitored in the CE subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Throughout the BP-recording, a SBP decrease of 10.1% (95% CI: 8.6-11.5) and 10.4% (95% CI: 9.0-11.8) was documented in patients with LAA and LAC respectively, while a milder drop was recorded in CE (3.7%, 95% CI: 2.4-5.0) and IUC (5.5%, 95% CI: 4.1-6.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity (p&lt;0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> (p=0.013) was independently associated with a milder spontaneous SBP reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous SBP course varies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes of different etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may have implications in the optimal management of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
