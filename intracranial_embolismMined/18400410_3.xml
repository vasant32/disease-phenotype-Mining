<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mild ME upregulated endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) and protein tyrosine nitration in brain microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Strong beta-amyloid immunoreactivity coincident with increased eNOS immunoreactivity was observed in microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting of purified brain microvessels revealed that beta-amyloid accumulation significantly increased 1 week after ME induction and remained elevated for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, beta-amyloid accumulation in brain parenchyma was also observed in areas surrounding injured microvessels at 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of Alzheimer's-related hyperphosphorylated tau proteins also concomitantly increased in neurons surrounding regions of beta-amyloid accumulation 12 weeks after ME induction, as did <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase (GSK3beta) (Tyr-216) phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, ME-induced aberrant eNOS expression and subsequent protein tyrosine nitration in microvessels preceded beta-amyloid accumulation both in microvessels and brain parenchyma, leading to hyperphosphorylation of neuronal tau proteins through GSK3beta activation </plain></SENT>
