<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To review a single-institution experience with endovascular repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> (ATAR) performed on an emergency basis using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) exclusively as the navigation tool for stent-graft implantation (no arteriography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 1998 and November 2006, 26 consecutive patients (19 men; mean age 38+/-19 years, range 15 to 83) underwent endovascular repair of ATAR performed by a surgical team using IVUS and fluoroscopy for lesion characterization and stent-graft deployment guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography was routinely used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients to visualize the aortic lesion and rule out residual flow after device deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sealing of the aortic tear was evaluated by postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IVUS revealed an extensive disruption of the tunica intima and media (&gt;180 degrees ) in 46% (12/26) of patients; the disruption was circumferential in 3 cases, with pseudocoarctation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aortic diameter at the site of rupture measured 24+/-4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary technical success was 92% (24/26); 1 persistent but small proximal endoleak and an intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (4% in-hospital mortality) from abdominal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in an octogenarian accounted for the failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related complications (2, 8%) included the aforementioned endoleak and a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> secondary to cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> associated with the repairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> traumatic aortic disruption yields promising results, with high technical success and minimal procedure-related morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IVUS as the primary navigation tool for device implantation allows prompt endovascular setup, instant aortic measurements, and precise visualization of the aortic disruption </plain></SENT>
