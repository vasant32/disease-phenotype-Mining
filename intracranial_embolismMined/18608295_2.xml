<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the standard of care in the treatment of CAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of CAGE after accidental ingestion of 33%<z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> treated with HBOT resulting in reversal of both the clinical and radiologic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 48 year-old male took two sips of 33% <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A short time later, he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002248'>hematemesis</z:hpo>, left sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>, and left homonymous hemianopsia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial laboratory studies, chest x-ray, and brain CT were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI demonstrated areas of restricted diffusion and T2 hyper intensities in multiple vascular territories consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to CAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen hours after arrival, the patient underwent HBOT at 3 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for 30 minutes and 2.5 ATA for 60 minutes with clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI at six months demonstrated resolution of the hyper intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: A search of MEDLINE from 1950 to present revealed only two cases of CAGE from ingestion of concentrated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> treated with HBOT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both cases, similar to ours, had complete resolution of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the seven reported cases of CAGE from <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> that did not undergo HBOT, only in one patient was there a report of symptom resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ingestion of even a small amount of concentrated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> can result in cerebral air gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be of benefit in reversing the symptoms and preventing permanent neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
