<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Summary: There are some problems such as a narrow therapeutic time window and severe side effects of fibrinolytics in the therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method to remove a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0936263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral thrombus</z:e> more rapidly with fewer fibrinolytics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Q-switch pulsed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49648">holmium</z:chebi> (Ho): YAG laser with 86 mJ/pulse, pulse duration of 200ns and wavelength of 2.1 mm was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The laser beam was transmitted through a 0.6 mm diameter <z:chebi fb="115" ids="46727">quartz</z:chebi> optical fiber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments were conducted in a stainless steel container equipped with observation windows  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The test chamber was filled with distilled water at 283K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At first, the formation of laser-induced bubbles in a 4 mm diameter glass tube was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bubble gradually expanded and reached a maximum size at about 1 ms after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A shock wave induced by ignition of silver <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40910">azide</z:chebi> pellet was interacted with it at 500mus before Ho:YAG laser irradiation, which resulted in forming a liquid jet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This liquid jet penetrated into an artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> made of gelatin, and its maximum penetration depth was 4.2 mm, which was nearly twice deeper than the laser irradiation only (2.2 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combination of this liquid jet and fibrinolytics will realize more rapid recanalization with fewer drugs </plain></SENT>
