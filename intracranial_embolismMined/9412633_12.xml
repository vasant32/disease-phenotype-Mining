<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There has been concern about carotid percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) carrying a greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> than carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We set out to compare cerebral hemodynamics and microembolization during carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used transcranial Doppler to monitor the middle cerebral artery of 28 patients undergoing carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> (n = 14) or carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with a shunt (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each period during which the internal carotid artery was occluded by <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> balloon or by clamp when the shunt was not in place was timed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual periods were summated to give a total occlusion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic time was defined as the period for which mean middle cerebral artery velocity fell to a third or less of baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals were counted during each procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CEA resulted in significantly longer individual and total occlusion time than <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> (mean individual occlusion time, seconds), CEA, 168 +/- 51; <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, 20 +/- 7; P &lt; .001; mean total occlusion time; CEA, 337 +/- 70; <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, 26 +/- 10; P &lt; .001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ischemic time was also significantly longer during CEA than during <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> (CEA, 165 +/- 40; <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, 17 +/- 5; P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were significantly more microembolic signals during <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> than during CEA (mean number of microembolic signals during CEA, 52 +/- 64; during <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, 202 +/- 119; P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between any of the parameters measured and periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which occurred in one patient in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> results in less hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but more cerebral microembolism than CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this small series, however, it is not possible to comment on the relations between ischemic time, microembolism, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
