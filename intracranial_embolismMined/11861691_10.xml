<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the reduction of embolic signals after the initiation of an antithrombotic secondary prevention in patients with recent arterioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to determine the predictive value of decreased microembolism on the risk of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty six consecutive patients (55 men, 31 women; mean age 60.6 years) with a non-disabling arterioembolic ischaemic event in the anterior circulation within the last 30 days and a medium grade or high grade stenosis (&gt; or =50%) of the ipsilateral carotid or middle cerebral artery underwent 1 hour transcranial Doppler monitoring as part of the admission examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic secondary prevention was started after completion of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom embolic signals were detected underwent a second monitoring within 4 days (mean time 1.8 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up prospectively to evaluate the relation between presence and persistence of embolic signals and the risk of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within the next 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 44 patients, embolic signals were detected at admission, a mean 5.4 days (range 0 to 21 days) after the initial event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty five were positive for embolic signals also at the second monitoring, in 19 signals had ceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty two patients without embolic signals at admission served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow up, six ischaemic events (two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>) occurred in 25 patients with persisting embolic signals but none in 19 patients in whom signals had ceased by the second monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient in the control group had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of a recurrent event was 0.45 per 30 patient-days if embolic signals persisted compared with 0.015 if signals could not be detected or had ceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Persistence of embolic signals was an independent predictor of a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio 37.0; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3.5 to 333; p&lt;0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cessation and decrease of embolic signals was associated with the administration of antiplatelet agents but not with anticoagulation with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rapid cessation of embolic signals detected in patients with recently symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> decreases increased risk of an early ischaemic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Effect of antithrombotic agents on embolic signals might serve as a marker for their efficacy on preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
