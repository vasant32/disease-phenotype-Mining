<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical features and predisposing factors of recurrent embolization have not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were 227 consecutive patients (128 men and 99 women, aged 68.6 +/- 13.2 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who did not receive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy during the first 14 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assigned the subjects to two groups according to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of recurrent attacks within 14 days of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed their clinical features, coagulation study results, and underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recurrent brain or systemic embolization during the first 14 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was noted in 46 patients (20.3%, group A) but not in the other 181 (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrent embolization was more frequently noted at an early phase than at a late phase during the initial 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality was higher in group A (19.6%) than in group B (8.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma level of antithrombin III (77.8 +/- 19.5%) at admission in group A patients was significantly lower than that in group B patients (87.9 +/- 15.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After admission, hematocrit decreased in group B patients but slightly increased in group A patients, in whom <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> were more commonly used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">Rheumatic heart disease</z:e> and prosthetic valves, in addition to the presence of intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, were seen more commonly in group A patients, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747057" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organic heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were more frequent in group B patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low plasma levels of antithrombin III, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>, the use of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e>, prosthetic valves, and intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> seem to be predisposing factors for recurrent embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Immediate anticoagulation may be considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients if such predisposing factors are demonstrated </plain></SENT>
