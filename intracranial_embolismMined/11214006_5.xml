<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies investigating the relationship between atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> and subsequent adverse clinical outcomes have demonstrated that the single most important risk factor for neurologic injury following cardiac surgery is the presence of aortic atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of these studies suggest that atheroemboli are correlated with neurologic injury following cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
