<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we report our experience with the neuronal protective effects of citicoline alone and in combination with urokinase in a model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both medications were injected 2 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a focal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced with embolization of a clot into the origin of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This produces a large infarction involving the cortex and the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were observed for neuronal deficts at 2 and 24 h after surgery and were sacrificed 72 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Saline-treated animals showed a large infarction involving the cerebral cortex and basal ganglion in most animals (volume 33.1 +/- 9.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with citicoline alone were divided in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first group of animals were treated with a single injection (300 mg/kg, ip) of the medication 2 h after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The second group was treated with the active medication intermittently (3 x 300 mg/kg, ip) over a 72-h period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in the neuronal damage in the cortex in the animals treated with citicoline (single dose, 20.9 +/- 9.7%, P = 0.01; intermittent injection, 18.9 +/- 11.4%, P &lt; 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The last experiment evaluated the usefulness of the combination of citicoline with intraarterial urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combination showed significantly more protection than with urokinase or citicoline alone (volume 13.6 +/- 9.1%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude from our experiments that citicoline may offer significant neuronal protection that may be further enhanced with the addition of a thrombolytic agent </plain></SENT>
