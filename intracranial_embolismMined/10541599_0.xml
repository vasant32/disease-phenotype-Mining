<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With the aim of quantifying the use of oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) therapy in clinical practice, we surveyed 150 consecutive patients admitted with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each patient was administered a questionnaire relating to the classic vascular risk factors and to the antithrombotic treatment received at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of AF was formulated at the time of admission in 45 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 105 cases with a previous diagnosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> therapy was relatively or absolutely contraindicated in 21 patients (20%), whereas the other 84 (80%) were ideal candidates for the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 20 (24%) were actually receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, 16 (19%) were on platelet anti-aggregants (PA), and 48 (57%) were receiving no antithrombotic treatment at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even lower percentages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> use were found in the patients with a previous (20%) or recent (16%) history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon discharge, of the 115 patients without contraindications to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (84 with previously known and 31 with newly diagnosed AF), 50% were receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> and 20% PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this survey show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> therapy is little used in the Valle d'Aosta Region for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in AF patients at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lack of knowledge among the general population, the difficulty of initiating the therapy in patients such as ours with severe comorbidities, and the absence of disorganization of centers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> monitoring may be the main reasons underlying this low level of use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Population screening or a sensitization campaign could increase the identification of subjects at risk, whereas better organization of coagulation monitoring centers could encourage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> use in subjects at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
