<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The auditory sensitivity of 16 participants to 574 simulated "emboli" was examined using psychoacoustic techniques to assess how the probability of detection varies with embolic signal parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed measurements of the threshold for detection of simulated embolic signals are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These provide evidence that the measured <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>-to-blood threshold ranges between 2 dB and 14 dB as a continuous function of signal duration and frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of the threshold is closely linked to both embolic signal parameters and the properties of the blood flow signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the current fixed choice of threshold does not provide a good approximation to the true threshold of detection across the full range of embolic signal parameters </plain></SENT>
