<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we induced cerebral atheroembolic infarction in adult male NZW rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post induction we treated groups of animals with saline, streptokinase (SK)-only, or streptokinase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9407">taurochenodeoxycholate</z:chebi> (TCDC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tissues were fixed 24 hours later and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were then measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No remarkable damage resulted from the agents' use in the cerebral vascular bed, or in the hepatic parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both treatments produced a dramatic reduction in the area and perimeter measurements of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> when compared to control-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both SK treatments drastically reduced the sizes of induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that a combined thrombolytic/emulsification treatment may drastically reduce the extent and distribution of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> which result from cerebral atherothromboembolism </plain></SENT>
