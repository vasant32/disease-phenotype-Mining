<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study we evaluated 61 patients consecutively admitted to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit after their first ischemic neurological deficit involving the vascular territory of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and/or ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients underwent a 30-minute bilateral transcranial Doppler monitoring of their <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> for the identification of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monitoring was performed within 12.3 + -9.3 (average mean + -SD) hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> for the first time, the second time 48 hours after first TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prognosis for the recovery of neurological deficits was evaluated by using the Barthel index (BI) and Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (SSS) at the time of admission of the patient to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit, and with Barthel indices after one month and after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, 56% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients showed <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in at least one of the two registrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were recorded not only on the symptomatic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> prevalence between both TCD monitorings was significantly different (total <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> prevalence: 1st TCD: 26 patients: 2nd TCD: 13 patients; p &lt; 0.04; ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> prevalence: 1st TCD: 19 patients; 2nd TCD: 9 patients; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regression analysis showed a significant influence of the total <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> rate on both neurological scores at admission (SSS: 0.03; Barthel index: 0.04), but not for the Barthel scores after one and three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found an influence of the time interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> rate and the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
