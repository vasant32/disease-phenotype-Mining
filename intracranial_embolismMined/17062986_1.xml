<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Use of the device was evaluated using experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model systems were created: <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> embolism model with flow system, pig embolism model, and <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-pig tortuous artery model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The series of extraction procedures (capture, retrieval, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>) was examined in the models under flow control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coagulated blood clot was adopted as embolic material, to simulate embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of the carotid or middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retrieval of the clot was successful in only one of six trials in the <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> model of the carotid artery, as the clot easily worked free from the helical tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo> was successful in three of the six trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retrieval was successful in two of four trials in the middle cerebral artery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> was successful in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Retrieval was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five trials in the pig embolism model, and three of five trials in the <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-pig tortuous artery model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Merci Retriever does not always retain the embolism, and the helix tends to distort in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or rough lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo> is not always successful </plain></SENT>
