<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate large <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> by contrast-enhanced 3D MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients, nine women and two men, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> involved the internal carotid artery in seven patients, the middle cerebral artery in one, the basilar artery in two, and the posterior cerebral artery in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were obtained using FLASH (fast low angle shot) on a 1.5 T system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We obtained axial images first, then sagittal and coronal images by multiplanar reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those images were reviewed for comparison with conventional and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We could easily evaluate the true aneurysmal size, the intraaneurysmal constitution (patent lumen and intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>), and the detailed relationship of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to the surrounding vascular and neural structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for the cavernous internal carotid artery, we could identify the aneurysmal neck by carefully observing axial, sagittal, and coronal images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the progression of intraaneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the patency of the parent arterial lumen after the endovascular treatment were well appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We consider that 3D MRI appears to be useful for evaluation of the large <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
