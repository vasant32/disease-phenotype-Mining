<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> presumably related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) are at risk for recurrent cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in long-term clinical outcome were investigated among patients with percutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure and those who received medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 1994 and 2000, 308 consecutive patients with cerebrovascular events presumably related to <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> underwent either percutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure (150 patients) or medical treatment (158 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up prospectively for up to 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were lost during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, or peripheral embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 103 propensity score-matched pairs of patients who underwent percutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure or medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 9 years, the primary composite outcome occurred in 11 patients slated to <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure (11%) and 22 patients slated to medical treatment (21%; hazard ratio=0.43; 95% confidence interval=0.20-0.94; P=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment effect was driven by a decrease in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> of 5% versus 14%, respectively (hazard ratio=0.31; 95% confidence interval=0.10-0.94; P=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause (6% in both groups) and cardiovascular (3% in both groups) mortality appeared to be identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this long-term observational, propensity score-matched study, percutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure was more effective than medical treatment for the secondary prevention of recurrent cerebrovascular events among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
