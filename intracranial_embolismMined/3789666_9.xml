<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of EEG monitoring and selective shunting was associated with a reduction in the frequency of carotid shunts (49 to 12%) and a decline in combined major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> and mortality (2.3 to 1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the routine use of intraoperative EEG monitoring is a valuable procedure, particularly in patients at high risk for perioperative neurological complications </plain></SENT>
