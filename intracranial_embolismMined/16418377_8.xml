<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated the association of the number of solid cerebral microemboli during unprotected CAS with the frequency of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> as detected by diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed multifrequency transcranial Doppler detection of solid microemboli in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) during CAS in 27 consecutive patients with symptomatic high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection was used in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DWI before and 24 +/- 2 hours after CAS was used to detect new ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected 484 solid microemboli in 17 patients (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging 24 +/- 2 hours after CAS, 6 patients (22%) had developed 13 new clinically silent DWI lesions within the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with Doppler evidence of solid emboli during CAS, the incidence of new DWI lesions was higher (29%) than in patients without Doppler evidence of solid emboli during the procedure (10%); this difference was not statistically significant (P = .25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of solid microemboli during CAS in patients with new ipsilateral DWI lesions was not significantly different from that in patients without new ipsilateral DWI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Solid microembolism is a common event during unprotected CAS; however, the frequency of procedure-related silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> appears to be independent of the number of solid cerebral microemboli during the procedure </plain></SENT>
