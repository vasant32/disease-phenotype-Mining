<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> generally results in severer disability, since it typically has a larger ischemic area than the other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is difficult to differentiate cardioembolic from noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (atherothrombotic and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), whenever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients have sinus rhythm at the time of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the levels of plasma brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with cardioembolic or noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and assessed whether this could provide a basis for differentiating cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (especially due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>) from noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our patient cohort consisted of 99 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> who were admitted to Kagawa University School of Medicine Hospital from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We excluded 23 patients with valve disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the remaining 76 patients (51 males, 25 females) was 70.0 +/- 10.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six patients had cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (including permanent and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>); the remaining 40 had noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was evaluated on the first morning after admission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (permanent and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>), the plasma brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, ratio of peak early filling velocity to peak atrial systolic velocity (E/A) and left atrial diameter were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001), and the left atrial appendage flow was significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.001), compared with noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analyzed in those 4 factors, cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was strongly predicted with &gt;95% accuracy assessed by plasma brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and left atrial appendage flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From our results, it was suggested that the first-day brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and left atrial appendage flow measurements would be helpful in differentiating cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> from noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
