<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because there is no biologic marker offering precise information about <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology, many patients receive a diagnosis of undetermined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> even after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available diagnostic tests are done, precluding correct treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To examine the diagnostic value of a panel of biochemical markers to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiologies, consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain computed tomography, ultrasonography, cardiac evaluations, and other tests were done to identify an etiologic diagnosis according to TOAST classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn on Emergency Department arrival (&lt;24 hours) to test selected biomarkers: C-reactive protein, D-dimer, soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products, matrix metalloproteinase-9, S-100b, brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP), neurotrophin-3, caspase-3, chimerin, and secretagogin (assayed by ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 707 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients included, 36.6% were cardioembolic, 21.4% atherothrombotic, 18.1% lacunar, and 23.9% of undetermined origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High levels of BNP, soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products, and D-dimer (P&lt;0.0001) were observed in patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors (odds ratios with CIs are given) of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> 15.3 (8.4-27.7, P&lt;0.001); other embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathies</z:e> 14.7 (4.7-46, P&lt;0.001); total anterior circulation infarction 4 (2.3-6.8, P&lt;0.001); BNP &gt;76 pg/mL 2.3 (1.4-3.7, P=0.001); and D-dimer &gt;0.96 microg/mL 2.2 (1.4-3.7, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even among patients with transient symptoms (n=155), a high BNP level identified cardioembolic etiology (6.7, 2.4-18.9; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A model combining clinical and biochemical data had a sensitivity of 66.5% and a specificity of 91.3% for predicting cardioembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using a combination of biomarkers may be a feasible strategy to improve the diagnosis of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, thus rapidly guiding other diagnostic tests and accelerating the start of optimal secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
