<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Responses were received from 247 (71%), and 219 identified themselves as primary or consulting physicians for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the previous 12 months, these 219 physicians estimated that they had seen a total of 14,636 patients within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and 22% of these patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported indications were prevention of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (82% of physicians) and progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the frequent use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, only 6.4% of neurologists felt that it has been shown to be effective, and 16.4% felt that it has been shown to be of no value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary concern about the use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was lack of proven efficacy in 48% and safety concerns in 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of a future trial testing the efficacy of antithrombotic drugs would be useful for most neurologists in their management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
