<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are associated with increased perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral embolization is an additional risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) accurately identifies mobile atheroma </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> associated with mobile atheromas is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 1994 and July 1998, 40 patients with mobile atheromas by TEE and evidence of embolization were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were captured prospectively in a vascular registry and were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid artery disease</z:e> was evaluated using carotid duplex imaging in an accredited vascular laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e>, 70% or greater stenosis, underwent arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with significant carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> then underwent carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with mobile atheromas were maintained on anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients with mobile atheromas of the aortic arch were diagnosed with TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 40 patients had evidence of embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patient age ranged from 57 to 73 years (mean 68.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were 22 men and 18 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Twenty of 40 (50%) patients presented with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 40 (28%) patients presented with diffuse atheroembolization (lower extremity embolization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Six of 40 (15%) patients presented with a completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Three of 20 (7%) patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> extremity <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> secondary to a peripheral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of 40 (58%) of patients had significant carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, 70% or greater stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These 23 patients underwent both arteriography and carotid endarterectomy without complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with anticoagulation and have remained anticoagulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up between 2 to 48 months (mean 18) has demonstrated no further evidence of systemic embolization in these 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Repeat TEE was performed in 6 of 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These follow-up studies no longer visualized mobile atheromas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mobile atheromas are recognized sources for embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Routine carotid duplex imaging should be performed in patients found to have mobile atheromas of the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy appears to be safe in patients who have combined carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and mobile atheromas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation may have therapeutic considerations in the management of this condition </plain></SENT>
