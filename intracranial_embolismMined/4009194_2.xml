<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A five-year neurological and EEG follow-up was carried on 55 patients who had undergone open-heart surgery for valve replacement in order to investigate the long-term results of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The five-year survival rate was 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> after operation was 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">Transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> occurred in five patients but no more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of embolic events was 2.8 per 100 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various subjective symptoms and complaints showed a highly beneficial outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also the five-year EEG outcome was encouraging; the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> had fallen from the value before operation of 45% to 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The harmful influence of long perfusion time (extracorporeal circulation) during operation was found to be reflected in the long-term EEG outcome and, significantly, not only in the patients who had, but also in those who had not developed clinical abnormalities complicating the immediate course after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although a valvular surgery patient faces a number of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> problems before, during and after operation, the overall long-term outcome of successful surgery seems highly beneficial in neurological terms </plain></SENT>
