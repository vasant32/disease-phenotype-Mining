<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine if adjustments in the arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) level can reduce cerebral and ocular embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty pigs underwent cardiopulmonary bypass at 38 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At either hypercarbia (PaCO2 = 50-55 mmHg, group H, n = 10) or hypocarbia (PaCO2 = 25-30 mmHg, group L, n = 10), an embolic load of 1.2 x 10(50 67-microm orange fluorescent microspheres was injected into the aortic cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before and after embolization, cerebral and ocular blood flows were determined at normocapnia using 15-microm fluorescent microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After cardiopulmonary bypass was completed, the eyes were enucleated and brain tissue samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microspheres were isolated and the fluorescence was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In groups H and L, the mean PaCO2 values at embolization were 52+/-3 mmHg and 27+/-2 mmHg, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total and regional embolization were significantly less in <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> than in hypercapnic animals: 142% more emboli were detected in the brain in group H than in group L (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow after embolization was unchanged in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, fewer ocular emboli occurred in hypocapnic animals than in hypercapnic animals (P = 0.044), but in contrast to the brain, ocular blood flow decreased significantly in both groups after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral embolization is determined by the PaCO2 at the time of embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In cardiopulmonary bypass practice, reductions in PaCO2 during periods of embolic risk may reduce the risk for brain injury </plain></SENT>
