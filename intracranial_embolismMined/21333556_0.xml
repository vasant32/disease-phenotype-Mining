<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are, however limited data on the differential prevalence of SE in the first few days/weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 156 consecutive patients (symptomatic n = 123, asymptomatic n = 33) underwent Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) during an 18 month period and had an accessible window permitting 30 min of pre-operative TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A prospective study was conducted with assessors blinded to clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Spontaneous embolisation was detected in 31 symptomatic patients (25%) of which 1/1 (100%), 14/35 (40%), 8/37 (22%) and in 8/50 (16%) patients presented within 48 h, 3-7 days, 8-14 days and &gt;14 days respectively from the index clinical event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SE occurred in only 6% of asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of 31 symptomatic patients with SE, seven (22.6%) suffered recurrent cerebrovascular events following admission as opposed to 11/92 patients (11.9%) who had no evidence of spontaneous embolisation after admission (OR 2.2 (95% CI 0.8-6.1))(P = 0.2) CONCLUSION: Patients presenting for CEA in the hyperacute period after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/Minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have a high incidence of SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with SE had a 23% risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data support the current drive towards expedited CEA in recently symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
