<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight of these cases had not experienced a high intracranial pressure during life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 19 cases had been rendered unconscious at the moment of impact and had remained so or in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e> until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is therefore concluded that diffuse damage to white matter may occur as a primary event at the moment of impact, that is, it is one type of immediate impact damage to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is also concluded that this type of damage is the pathological basis of 'primary brain-stem injury' since in no patient thought clinically to have sustained 'primary brain-stem injury' were abnormalities confined to the brain-stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since no patient with this type of brain damage recovered consciousness after injury, it is probable that diffuse damage to white matter is the most important single factor governing the outcome in a patient who sustains a non-missile head injury </plain></SENT>
