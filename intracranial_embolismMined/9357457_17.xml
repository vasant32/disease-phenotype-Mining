<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of particulate embolization after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran-40</z:chebi> infusion in patients with sustained postoperative embolization, and the impact of transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring plus adjuvant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> therapy on the rate of postoperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective study in 100 patients who underwent CEA with 6-hour postoperative monitoring using a TCD that was modified to allow automatic, intermittent recording from the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery waveform (10 minute sample every 30 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An incremental <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran-40</z:chebi> infusion was commenced if 25 or more emboli were detected in any 10-minute period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 48% of patients had one or more emboli detected in the postoperative period, particularly in the first 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, sustained embolization that required <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> therapy developed in only five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each case, the rate of embolization rapidly diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A small proportion of patients have sustained embolization after CEA, which in previous studies has been shown to be highly predictive of thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intervention with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> reduced and subsequently stopped <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the emboli in those in whom it was used and contributed to a 0% perioperative morbidity and mortality rate in this series </plain></SENT>
