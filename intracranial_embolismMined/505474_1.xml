<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dogs were divided into 3 general groups: A) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> placement 1 h following anastomosis; B) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> placement 5 h prior to anastomosis; C) control group without anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anastomosis prior to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion has a favorable clinical effect and reduces the size of an infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anastomosis 5 h after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> placement is deleterious unless other therapeutic modalities can be shown to delay the course of infarction </plain></SENT>
