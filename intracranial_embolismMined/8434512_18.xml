<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were then followed for a mean period of 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four percent of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were categorized as either being giant or large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Late complications were observed in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A rupture of newly formed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at the anterior communicating artery occurred in 2 cases 8 or 9 years after either trapping or performing a ICA ligation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these patients, previous angiography could not reveal any abnormalities at the anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A rupture of a contralateral ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was seen in a patient whose ipsilateral ICA was ligated for a ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> 22 years previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An enlargement of the contralateral giant cavernous ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> became symptomatic 6 years after a partial ligation of the ICA combined with an EC-IC bypass for a giant cavernous carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> on the other side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> occurred in a young patient and an elderly patient with a small anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, 9 and 19 years respectively, after trapping of the ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, although the cause could not be definitely ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding occurred in one patient who died 8 years after a carotid ligation and a partial clipping of the ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic stress may therefore play a major role in inducing new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or growing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
