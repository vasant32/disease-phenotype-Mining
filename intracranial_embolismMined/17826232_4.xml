<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although few patients have clinically evident neurologic deficit, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) presents a number of cases with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study should elucidate preoperative risk factors for perioperative microemboli that cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 183 patients (58 women, 69.2 +/-12.7 years; 125 men, 69.3 +/- 8.9 years) with high-degree carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DWI was performed before and after CEA to analyze new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained before operation to measure fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CRP), and preoperative high-sensitive CRP (hsCRP) was analyzed in 30 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative DWI revealed new ipsilateral ischemic lesions in 41 patients (22.4%), and eight (4.4%) showed new neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative fibrinogen levels were higher in patients with new lesions (397.6 mg/dL +/- 104.7 mg/dL) than in those without (324.7 mg/dL +/- 74.2 mg/dL, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative levels of hsCRP were also higher in patients with new lesions (7.9 mg/dL +/- 5.2 mg/dL) than in those without (2.8 mg/dL +/- 2.6 mg/dL, P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant association was found between fibrinogen and CRP (Spearman rho = 0.402; P &lt; .001) as well as hsCRP (Spearman rho = 0.603, P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No association was found between postoperative lesions and CRP (P = .833) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that preoperative levels of fibrinogen and hsCRP are independent determinants for new periprocedural cerebral ischemic lesions caused by microembolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is still not sufficient evidence to recommend measurement of CRP as a prognostic marker for perioperative cerebral lesion </plain></SENT>
