<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have estimated plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28667">11-dehydroTXB2</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects studied were 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (62 +/- 9 years old) and 41 healthy controls (61 +/- 7 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28667">11-dehydroTXB2</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> were determined by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28667">11-dehydroTXB2</z:chebi> levels in patients and controls were 5.4 +/- 2.5 and 1.8 +/- 0.9 pg ml, respectively, and the difference was significant (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> also was higher in patients than in controls: 401 +/- 61 vs 311 +/- 51 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28667">11-dehydroTXB2</z:chebi> was found to be a more effective parameter to distinguish between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Estimation of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28667">11-dehydroTXB2</z:chebi> levels is a reliable method to detect platelet hyperfunction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
