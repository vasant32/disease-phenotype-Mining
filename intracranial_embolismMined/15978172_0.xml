<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Clinically silent microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) can be detected by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is theoretical evidence that lower ultrasound emission frequencies may lead to a higher signal intensity and thus sensitivity to detect <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared a 1-MHz probe with a 2-MHz probe regarding sensitivity in the detection of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection by transcranial Doppler ultrasound is very time consuming and semi-automated detection is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied an on-line algorithm using the bi-gate technique and the two transmission frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After defining detection thresholds of &gt; or = 12 dB (1 MHz) and &gt; or = 10 dB (2 MHz) with eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects as <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-negative controls, taking into account natural fluctuations of the Doppler spectrum, we studied 36 patients with ischaemic events and five asymptomatic patients with incidental embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients subsequently underwent a 1-hour unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection from the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) or the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>), respectively, using 1 and 2 MHz for 30 minutes each in a randomized order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The software algorithm was compared with a blinded off-line analysis by an experienced observer as a gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The investigator detected 198 MES (range 0-41 MES) in the recordings of 29 patients out of the 41 patients using the 1-MHz probe and 101 MES (range 0-32 MES) in the recordings of 14 patients using the 2-MHz probe (p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of the software to detect <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> confirmed by the investigator was 31% using 1 MHz and 41% using 2 MHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value was 6 and 30%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The sensitivity and positive predictive values of the automated algorithm to detect <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were unacceptably low for clinical practice with both frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of 1 MHz instead of 2 MHz may, however, be useful when evaluating the recordings off-line by an experienced blinded observer </plain></SENT>
