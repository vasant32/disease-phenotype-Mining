<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between these mutations and arterial thrombotic syndromes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some studies have suggested a relationship between them, but other authors have considered it unlikely that these anomalies are a major risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the clinical point of view, a question arises concerning the risk of repeated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients carrying one of these two mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The question is whether the recurrence is attributable to the mutations or to the presence of additional circumstantial risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the risk of repeated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> varies considerably from one patient to another, decisions about long-term treatment require weighing the persistence of risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (venous and arterial), especially in selected cases such as young patients or patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of unusual localization </plain></SENT>
