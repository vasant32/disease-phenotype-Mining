<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial standard blood coagulation assays, including plasma fibrinogen chromatography, and neurological studies were performed on 220 patients admitted to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were compared against those of three control groups: (1)<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, (2)a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> control group and(3)a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma HMWFC findings were significantly (p less than 0.001) higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor group than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma HMWFC values were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> patients than in any of the control groups, and plasma fibrinogen, plasminogen, alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha2-macroglobulin also were significiantly higher (p less than 0.001) in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The greater the degree of initial neurological deficit, the greater were plasma HMWFC values (p less than 0.001), and high HMWFC values were associated with poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma HMWFC values were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings docunment the fact that a high proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, characterized by pathological enhancement of fibrin formation </plain></SENT>
