<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">Pneumoperitoneum</z:e> as applied during laparoscopic surgery can induce gas emboli formation, but it is unclear whether this is associated with cerebral embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in children, the number and intensity of high-intensity transient signals (HITS) detected using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography were assessed before and after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty children were monitored during laparoscopic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>General anaesthesia was performed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> and sufentanil or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2569">alfentanil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pressure-controlled ventilation was adapted to maintain end-tidal Pco(2) (Pe'(co(2))) between 4.7 and 6.0 kPa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline measurement of HITS rate, cerebral blood flow velocity, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded during steady-state anaesthesia before skin incision and during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> with intra-abdominal pressure of 1.6-2.0 kPa applied using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 14 children (70%), HITS were detected during baseline and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three additional children (15%) developed HITS during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> only and another three children (15%) presented no HITS during the investigation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAP and cerebral blood flow velocity increased with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HITS are present in 70% of paediatric surgical patients under balanced anaesthesia before surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">Pneumoperitoneum</z:e> further increased the occurrence of HITS </plain></SENT>
