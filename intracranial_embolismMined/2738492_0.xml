<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the age of patients with and without CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients, three males and one female with CT scan and one male and one female who did not have CT scan were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> (five had CT scan and five without CT scan) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We recommended that Hct should be determined in every thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and a high Hct should be further studied for evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera or relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
