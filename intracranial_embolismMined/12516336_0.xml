<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>38 (45.2%) of them had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, 46 (54.8%)--a residual stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 comprised 42 patients with cardial pathology characterized by intrachamber formation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and 2 patients with an open oval window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 2 consisted of 40 (48%) patients with diseases promoting formation of emboli on the cardiac valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest frequency, intensity and duration of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> were registered in patients of group 2 while the number of ischemic focuses was greater in patients of group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may be explained by the fact that intensity and duration of cardiogenic <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> depend more on acoustic density of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> than on its size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the site of the embologenic substrate together with quantitative and qualitative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> characteristics is the key factor of a high risk of cardiocerebral embolic complications </plain></SENT>
