<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An evaluation was carried out as to whether the prevalence and number of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasound were higher in patients with echolucent carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and five patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> from 20%-99% or occlusion underwent clinical investigations, duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries, and a 1 hour recording from the middle cerebral artery downstream to the carotid artery pathology using the four gate technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was more frequent and the number greater in symptomatic patients (21 out of 64 patients (33%); mean number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 64 patients 3.1) than in asymptomatic patients (four out of 41 patients (10%); mean number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 41 patients 0.3) (p=0.007, and p=0.006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echogenicity of the lesions did not affect either number or presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positivity for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> increased with increasing degree of stenosis (both p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four out of 12 patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> showed <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> could be detected in carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> below 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a decline in positivity of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and of the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> with the time after the ischaemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 80 days or more after the index event, only one patient showed <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, increasing degree of stenosis and presence of symptoms similarly affect macroembolic and microembolic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> may be a surrogate parameter for risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in a few asymptomatic patients suggests that clinically silent circulating microemboli may give additional information on the pending embolic potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Echolucency of the plaque was not related to an increased number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
