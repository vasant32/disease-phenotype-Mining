<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lesions typically appeared as homogeneous low density abnormalities, with no significant difference in scan characteristics between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> age groups, i.e., it was not possible to determine the age of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> by its noninfused, CCT appearance alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> showed "mass effect," and 4 of the 20 contrast-infused cases demonstrated marked density augmentation of "blush," indicating that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may resemble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in both of these properties </plain></SENT>
