<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that initial recompression to 2.8 atm abs on O2 may be as beneficial, thus avoiding potential treatment complications associated with the deeper depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we measured the recovery of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) following <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> in anesthetized, ventilated cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Air was infused into the carotid artery in increments of 0.08 ml until the SEP amplitude was reduced to less than 10% of the baseline value for 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three groups were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control group (n = 10) received no further treatment after SEP suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second group (6 atm abs/HBO] (n = 8) was compressed to 6 atm abs on air for 30 min followed by O2 breathing at 2.8 atm abs for 100 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third group (HBO) (n = 8) was compressed to 2.8 atm abs on O2 for 130 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The control group recovered 28.8 +/- 18.2% (mean +/- SD) of the baseline amplitude, whereas the 6 atm abs/HBO group recovered 48.6 +/- 22.6%, and the HBO group recovered 62.0 +/- 20.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An analysis of variance revealed that only the HBO group had significantly (P less than 0.01) better recovery than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in SEP recovery between the 2 treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that treating CAGE at 2.8 atm abs with O2 is a viable alternative to the current therapy </plain></SENT>
