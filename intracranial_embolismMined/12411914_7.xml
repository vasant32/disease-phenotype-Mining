<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) guidance of cardioversion in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is an alternative method to conventional anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although TEE is considered the gold standard for excluding left atrial (LA) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, in some patients dense spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) and artifacts may hamper the identification or exclusion of LA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Often those patients are refused cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether the application of echo contrast (Optison, Mallinckrodt, San Diego, Calif) facilitates the exclusion of LA appendage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in this patient group and allows for safer cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and dense SEC or inconclusive TEE findings were given echo contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with sinus rhythm served as control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echo contrast completely reduced artifacts in 13 of 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 12 of 19 patients with SEC, the LA appendage was completely filled after the application of echo contrast and, thus, SEC was completely suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 13 of 41 patients, it was filled incompletely and in 9 of 41 patients, a new mass resembling a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In total, of 25 of 41 patients with inconclusive TEE findings an atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was definitively excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those patients underwent cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of those patients had a cerebral embolic complication as assessed by cranial magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the application of echo contrast may facilitate the TEE exclusion of LA appendage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and, hence, improve the safety of TEE-guided cardioversion </plain></SENT>
