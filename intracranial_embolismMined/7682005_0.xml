<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analysis was based on the pathogenesis and detailed descriptions of the lesions, paying particular attention to hemorrhagic infarctions of the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using chi-square analysis, there was no significant difference between the frequency of lesions in anticoagulated versus non-anticoagulated patients </plain></SENT>
