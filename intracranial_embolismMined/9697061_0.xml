<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1985 and January 1991, 78 patients (26 males, 52 females; mean age 56.9 +/- 7.8 years) underwent isolated mitral valve replacement with a Pericarbon valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> bioprostheses were size 29 mm and implanted by the same surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total follow up was 663.2 pt-years and it was 97% complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early mortality was 1.3% (1/78); two minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> were observed as early complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 12 years the overall survival rate was 85.0 +/- and valve-related survival 93.1 +/- 3.0%; freedom from embolic events was 83.0 +/- 4.5% and from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> 98.7 +/- 1.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Freedom from primary tissue failure was 56.8 +/- 6.6%; it was 86.3 +/- 7.5% in patients aged &gt; 60 years and 36.8 +/- 8.2% in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 27 reoperations, 26 for primary tissue failure, one for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison between basal and follow up echocardiographic studies showed a significant stenotic deterioration of the bioprosthesis and a negligible incidence of regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Morphological findings of explanted bioprostheses were characterized by stenotic and diffuse microcalcification, but no tissue tear was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that the Pericarbon bioprosthesis is structurally safe and free from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> problems which afflicted the first and second generation of pericardial valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As with other tissue valves, the rate of calcification is age-dependent, suggesting preferential use of the Pericarbon prosthesis in elderly people </plain></SENT>
