<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While clinically symptomatic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> secondary to neuro-angiographic procedures is rare, the incidence in a large series of procedures is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding this complication's frequency and etiology is critical if systems are to be instituted to reduce its incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively reviewed 4,568 consecutive neuro-angiographic procedures performed between June 2000 and July 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occurrence and etiology of a symptomatic air <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was noted, and an incidence was calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures and for diagnostic arteriograms and interventional procedures individually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four symptomatic cerebral arterial air emboli occurred in 4,568 neuro-angiographic procedures over the five-year period (0.08%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No events occurred in 3,150 diagnostic angiograms while four occurred during 1,418 interventional procedures (0.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two cases occurred during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> coiling embolization (2/548; 0.4%); one case occurred during a carotid stent placement (1/138; 0.7%); one occurred during an internal carotid artery balloon occlusion test (1/73; 1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of these complications resulted in permanent neurologic deficits while one resulted in a transient neurologic change that cleared within 60 min of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sources for the emboli included the pressurized arterial flush lines connected to internal carotid artery catheters (three cases) and sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> with air subsequently entering the internal carotid artery catheter (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Symptomatic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is a rare event during neuro-angiographic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the etiologies of this infrequent event may permit us to further reduce its incidence </plain></SENT>
