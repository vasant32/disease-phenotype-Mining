<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty DCI subjects were imaged using 99Tcm hexamethylproplylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO) single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography (SPET) within days of their incident of DCI, and on a second occasion between 2 and 27 months after their DCI event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SPM was used to make a comparison between decompression illness studies and a second group of non-diving control studies for both early and late imaging of DCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A paired comparison of early and late imaging was also performed testing for correlation between time of imaging and changes in the rCBF pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The comparison between control subjects and early imaging of decompression illness showed a large, significant (P = 0.002), irregularly shaped, multi-focal area of reduced uptake in the left occipito-parieto-temporal region of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between control and repeat decompression illness imaging studies showed two areas of reduced uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first was similar to that found in the initial comparison although it was less significant (P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second region was similar but contra-lateral to the first region with significance P &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An attempt to correlate any changes in rCBF with the time that elapsed between each set of imaging found no areas of significant correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 99Tcm HMPAO SPET images of decompression illness display areas of reduced perfusion, which persist in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
