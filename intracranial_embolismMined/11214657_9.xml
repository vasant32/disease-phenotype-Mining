<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of ischemic events presumed to have a cardioembolic origin varies from 13% to 34% in the largest international multi-center studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, some authors have reported an incidence of general cardiogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ranging from 23% to 36% in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a useful investigation for identifying cardiac sources of embolism in patients without vascular alterations involving the carotid and vertebral districts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study comprised 73 patients with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who were investigated by both transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular echocolor sonography had been performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them with negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TEE demonstrated: atrial or ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 6 patients (8%), intracavitary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> in 2 (2%), spontaneous echocontrast in 11 (13%), valve strands in 6 (7%), complex aortic plaque in 10 (11%), patency of the foramen ovale in 17 (19%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> in 9 (11%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> and mitral calcifications in 9 (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other 18 patients, TEE did not reveal any anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Definite sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (clots and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>) were identified in 14% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the lesions; however, the majority (86%) were potential sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the two echocardiographic techniques demonstrated a greater sensitivity and specificity of TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although TEE was superior to TTE for identifying and evaluating potential embolic sources, we found both methods to be useful and would advise performing TTE before TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While TTE is not capable of identifying the majority of anomalies, it does provide useful information to guide subsequent transesophageal investigations </plain></SENT>
