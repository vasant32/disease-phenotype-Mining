<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The entire thoracic aorta and cardiac function were routinely monitored by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in 88 adult patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes in the atheromatous plaque in the distal aortic arch were observed before and after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 88 patients, 13 were found to have preoperative atheromatous plaque at the distal aortic arch and 8 (61.5%) of them suffered plaque rupture caused by jet stream from the arch cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient experienced apparent embolic episodes manifesting as cerebral and left leg embolisms; the remaining 7 had no clinical embolic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to prevent atheroembolic events, attention should be paid not only to the ascending aorta, but also to the distal arch and in this regard TEE is useful for detecting atheromatous changes of the aorta </plain></SENT>
