<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid endarterectomy clearly benefits patients with symptomatic severe stenosis (SCS), but the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is so low for asymptomatic patients (ACS) that the number needed to treat is very high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied transcranial Doppler (TCD) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection as a method for identifying patients at higher risk who would have a lower number needed to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of &gt; or =60% by Doppler ultrasound who had never been symptomatic (81%) or had been asymptomatic for at least 18 months (19%) were studied with TCD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection for up to 1 hour on 2 occasions a week apart; patients were followed for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 319 patients were studied, age (standard deviation) 69.68 (9.12) years; 32 (10%) had microemboli at baseline (TCD+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Events were more likely to occur in the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with microemboli were much more likely to have microemboli 1 year later (34.4 versus 1.4%; P&lt;0.0001) and were more likely to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the first year of follow-up (15.6%, 95% CI, 4.1 to 79; versus 1%, 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.36; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that TCD- ACS will not benefit from endarterectomy or stenting unless it can be done with a risk &lt;1%; TCD+ may benefit as much as SCS if their surgical risk is not higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that ACS should be managed medically with delay of surgery or stenting until the occurrence of symptoms or emboli </plain></SENT>
