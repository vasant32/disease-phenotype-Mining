<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in 23 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of occlusion was most suggestive when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> basal arteries except the affected middle cerebral artery were detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enhanced blood flow velocity in the anterior cerebral artery due to leptomeningeal collateralization was used as a corroborating criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With frequent follow-up examinations, we monitored reperfusion of the M1 segment resulting from recanalization or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> migration in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those patients undergoing recanalization within days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the first symptoms revealed variable clinical courses and lesion patterns on computed tomography, indicating the crucial importance of early and efficient leptomeningeal collateral blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was able to exclude middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with accuracy, which provides important clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, distal branch occlusions could not be detected with sufficient exactness </plain></SENT>
