<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the release of atheromatous plaque debris induced by carotid stenting procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with severe carotid atheromatous stenoses were treated by stent implantation under distal balloon protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samplings were obtained after stent deployment in the blood pooled below the inflated protection balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The samples were centrifuged and evaluated for plaque debris with the use of light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The debris release was quantitatively estimated by dividing the total volume of debris obtained by the mean debris size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients without endovascular procedure were used as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 2 main debris types found were nonrefringent cholesterol crystals (4 to 389 microm; 115 to 8697 in number) and lipoid masses (7 to 600 microm; 341 to 34 000 in number) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference compared with the samples obtained in the control group (P:=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Blood samples collected during stent implantation procedures contain a large quantity of atheromatous plaque debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This emphasizes the role of distal protection techniques in avoiding migration of this plaque material into the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
