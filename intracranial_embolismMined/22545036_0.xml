<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> associated with a left <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> that was treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 79-year-old right-handed man with no history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses was referred to our hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had been self-supported in the activity of daily living and could enjoy gardening until just before his admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, left conjugate deviation, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, and right pathological reflexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His NIHSS score was 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cranial DWI showed hyperintense lesions in the left middle cerebral artery territory, and MRA revealed left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We started treatment with the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator alteplase intravenously 3 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the therapy was ineffective, and the NIHSS score was 25 on the second day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A transthoracic echocardiogram and heart MRI showed a left <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, surgery was contraindicated because of the patient's poor general condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is a reasonable treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, even with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxoma</z:hpo>, we cannot always expect good effects, especially if the emboli are parts of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this case, we could not perform an endovascular mechanical embolectomy; however, we speculate that mechanical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> retrieval in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> might be effective in such cases </plain></SENT>
