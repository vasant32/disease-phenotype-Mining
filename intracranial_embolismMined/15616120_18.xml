<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional human research committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Written informed consent was obtained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups: 161 patients treated before filtering CPDs had become available (group 1), 151 patients treated with filtering CPDs (group 2), and 197 patients treated without CPDs after CPDs had become available (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical end points were cerebral ischemic events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler US end points included isolated microemboli, microembolic showers, macroemboli, and distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedure was divided into five phases: wiring, predilation, stent deployment, postdilation, and CPD handling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data not distributed normally were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For binomial data, the chi(2) test was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>P &lt; .05 indicated statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For each phase, median and interquartile range (IQR) for isolated microemboli in group 2 versus group 3 were as follows: wiring, 51 (IQR, 31-69) versus 27 (IQR, 15-48); predilation, 19 (IQR, 13-33) versus 13 (IQR, 8-19); stent deployment, 64 (IQR, 46-82) versus 48.5 (IQR, 33.25-66); and postdilation, 24 (IQR, 14-39) versus 16 (IQR, 11-27.5) (P &lt; .001 for each phase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median and IQR for microembolic showers were as follows: wiring, 0 (IQR, 0-3) versus 0 (IQR, 0-0); predilation, 1.5 (IQR, 0-4) versus 0 (IQR, 0-2); stent deployment, 22 (IQR, 11-36) versus 11 (IQR, 6-17); postdilation, three (IQR, 0-9) versus one (IQR, 0-4); (postdilation phase, P = .001; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other phases, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median for isolated microemboli in group 1 versus groups 2 and 3 combined were as follows: predilation, 10 (IQR, 5-22.75) versus 16 (IQR, 9-25) (P = .001); stent deployment, 32 (IQR, 15-58) versus 54 (IQR, 40.5-74) (P &lt; .001); and postdilation, 11 (IQR, 6-19) versus 18 (IQR, 12-33) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median for microembolic showers during stent deployment were six (IQR, 1-14) versus 13 (IQR, 7-26) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five patients died, and five major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 14 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eight macroemboli occurred in unprotected procedures; six distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> occurred in protected procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid angioplasty and stent placement yielded more microemboli in patients treated with filtering CPDs than in unprotected procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The infrequent occurrence of cerebral sequelae did not allow comprehensive statistical comparison between groups </plain></SENT>
