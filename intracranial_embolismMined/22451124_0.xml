<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes have different patterns of incidence and outcome, for that reason information on the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the incidence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and the prevalence of the major risk factors in the Spanish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: EPICES is an observational, multicenter and prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methodology includes systematic review of consecutive medical records of hospitalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in neurological care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>6,197 patients were included during the period April 2008 and January 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3,544 (57.2%) were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 71.4 Â± 12.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracerebral haemorrhage was diagnosed in 771 patients (12.4%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in 5,426 (87.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1,543 (28.4%) were classified as large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, cardioembolic 1,424 (26.2%), small-vessel occlusion 1,202 (22.5%), undetermined etiology 1,125 (20.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> of other uncommon origin was founded in 132 (2.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> is the most common risk factor in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (67%) and intracerebral haemorrhage (69.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The different types of ischemic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> showed differences in risk factors prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes are not significantly different from those of most Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The frequency of vascular risk factors differs between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> remains the most important modifiable risk factor </plain></SENT>
