<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An experiment was carried out to confirm or refute the importance of visual factors in spelling to dictation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The strongest confirmatory evidence was the patient's propensity for writing the individual letters of a word in nonlinear order, i.e. not left to right, sometimes even beginning in the middle of a word </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The influence of whole visual word-contours was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the results suggested that, in addition to the visual element, certain phonological factors played a small part in the patient's repertoire of strategies and this was confirmed in a second experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's multi-strategy approach to written spelling is discussed on the basis of an information-flow model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This leads on to consideration of the possibility of consolidating the residual phonological system as part of a re-education plan </plain></SENT>
