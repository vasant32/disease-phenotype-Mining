<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the patient with severely atherosclerotic or strongly <z:mp ids='MP_0010522'>calcified aorta</z:mp>, we should avoid cannulation into the aorta or clamping of it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case, we experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> although we chose the arterial cannulations into the axillary arteries because of the strong calcification of the ascending aorta and the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dissection was caused by the cannulation into the axillary artery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case showed the following points: 1) cannulation into an axillary artery is not always safe; 2) TEE is very useful to detect the complicated dissection during operation; 3) replacement of the ascending aorta alone can be one of the choices for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> caused by cannulation into an axillary artery </plain></SENT>
