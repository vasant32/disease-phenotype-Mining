<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean, peak, and minimal Reynolds numbers based on the bulk average velocity and diameter of the parent vessel were 600, 800, and 280, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For uneven branch flow, it is found that the flow activity inside the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and the stresses acting on the aneurysmal wall increase with increasing bifurcation angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the present angle suggests the presence of a critical bifurcation angle below which the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is prone to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, whereas above which the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is susceptible to progression or rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For evenly distributed branch flow, the intra-aneurysmal flow is sluggish and therefore prone to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied bifurcation angles </plain></SENT>
