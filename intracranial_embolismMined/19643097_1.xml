<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined if increasing regional cortical blood flow (RCBF) following an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is beneficial to neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared this to cerebral reperfusion induced by the administration of the thrombolytic Tenecteplase (TNK, 1.5 mg/kg, IV bolus) in the presence or absence of REP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we also measured the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> following REP and thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following embolization, RCBF was reduced to 48-55% of baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When REP was induced by removal of a CCA ligature, RCBF initially increased to 185% of baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>REP (P(50)=1.18+/-0.43 mg) had no effect on embolization-induced behavior measured 24 h following embolization compared to control (P(50)=1.01+/-0.48 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, TNK treatment (2-hours post-embolization) in the absence or presence of REP (initiated 2 h following embolization) significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased the group P(50) to 2.92+/-0.55 mg and 2.42+/-0.40 mg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> was increased in the REP (42%, p&lt;0.05) and REP-TNK (35%, p&gt;0.05) group compared to either the control group (5.5%) or TNK group (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study show that reperfusion of ICA can increase RCBF following embolization, but this is not associated with improved neurological outcome measured using quantal analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, TNK administration significantly increased behavioral outcome when given 2 h following embolization; an increase that is not affected by combining TNK with REP </plain></SENT>
