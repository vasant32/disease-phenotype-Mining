<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Periprocedural microembolization is a major and permanent risk for patients treated by angioplasty and stent placement of high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known however about the characteristics and significance of these embolized particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the volume and composition of debris captured by filters during carotid angioplasty and stent placement (CAS) of severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred one patients (mean age, 66.2 years; range, 35-82 years) with &gt; or = 70% stenosis of the ICA underwent filter-protected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural and semiquantitative analysis of the volume of filters was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multifactorial statistical analysis was performed to determine factors related to debris volume and composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>Transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> occurred in 6 patients (3%), and a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in 1 (0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Debris was found in 117 filters (58.2%), with volume &lt;1 lambda (0.001 mL) in 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of balloon dilations, age older than 65 years, and calcified plaques in pre-CAS angiography were significantly associated with the presence of particulates inside the filters (P &lt; .03, P &lt; .004, and P &lt; .05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vessel wall and atheromatous plaques are the main source of microemboli during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Embolization is mainly related to the number of balloon dilations during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Planning a proper and individualized strategy for the procedure in each patient is essential to minimize the potential effects of manipulation during CAS </plain></SENT>
