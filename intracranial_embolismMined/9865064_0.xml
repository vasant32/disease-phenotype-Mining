<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When he was admitted to the hospital, his blood pressure was 138/70 mmHg, and an ECG revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination showed only bilateral homonymous hemianopsia with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> or impairment of eye movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, or speech disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there was no evidence of obstruction of the thalamogeniculate or thalamoperforating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> in both occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perimetry showed bilateral homonymous hemianopsia; the left side of the macula was spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lack of neurological deficit other than bilateral homonymous hemianopsia indicates that only the right and left cortical branches of the posterior cerebral artery were occluded </plain></SENT>
