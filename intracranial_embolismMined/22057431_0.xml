<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported the correlation between regional weather patterns and various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> has inherent characteristics, and the difference of meteorological correlation between these diseases is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at investigating the disparity and intensity of the relationship between meteorological factors and various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 1113 events within 2 years were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daily meteorological parameters with and without events were, respectively, compared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (CE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (CH), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture (AAR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Days with CI <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> correlated with fewer sunshine hours, fewer solar radiation factors, greater amounts of precipitation factors, and more humidity factors, whereas CH and CE only showed lower correlation in temperature factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no relation seen between ACS, SAH, AD, AAR, and climatic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that climate affects various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases differently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding may help in understanding the mechanism of how vascular events are triggered </plain></SENT>
