<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, such deleterious effects have been attributed to endogenously generated tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, focusing on exogenously administered tPA for the purpose of fibrinolysis, we evaluated the extent and the degree of extravasated tPA in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Even after early recanalization of occluded cerebral vessels, significant infiltration of tPA occurred through the cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that exogenous tPA also exerts neurotoxic effects in the ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
