<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that, besides dislodgement of pre-existing intra-atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, the "stunned" atrium after CV is an important cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and subsequent embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether CV of AF is associated with occurrence of circulating microemboli (ME) representing a sensitive marker of the actual thromboembolic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients (22 men) aged 54 +/- 13 years suffering from valvular (n = 5) or nonvalvular (n = 24) AF were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 1 patient (with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF) had been put on oral anticoagulation (INR &gt;2.0) for at least 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after successful CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, exclusion of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was performed prior to CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five unilateral 1-hour transcranial Doppler ME monitorings over the middle cerebral artery were performed (1) before CV, and (2) immediately, (3) 4-6 h, (4) 24 h, and (5) 2-4 weeks after CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total absence of circulating ME was found before CV as well as during a cumulative monitoring time of 115 h after successful CV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electrical CV of AF after at least 3 weeks of effective anticoagulation is not associated with occurrence of cerebral circulating ME </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding requires further investigation including high-risk patients with AF undergoing CV based on different treatment protocols </plain></SENT>
