<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Usually, microembolic signal (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) monitoring is performed for MESs arising from downstream sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to describe the special characteristics of MESs originating from nearby sources in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 265 MESs detected in 5 patients (the study group) who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> within the territory of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses and 48 MESs detected in 7 patients (the control group) from proximal sources: severe internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> and prosthetic heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MESs were recorded with a 2-MHz, bigate transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed offline analyses of the recorded MESs using both post-fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectra and pre-FFT time domain signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MESs were divided into 3 types--focused-frequency signals (FFSs), bottom-frequency signals (BFSs), and multifrequency signals (MFSs)--according to the frequencies of the signals displayed on the post-FFT spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the study group, among 265 MESs, 245 (92.5%) were MFSs, 11 (4.2%) were FFSs, and 9 (3.4%) were BFSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group, among 48 MESs, 45 (93.5%) were FFSs, 2 (4.2%) were MFSs, and 1 (2.%) was a BFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was significant difference in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> type between <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses and other embolic sources (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the post-FFT spectra, MFSs recorded from <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses occupied multiple frequencies along the vertical axis, and the low-frequency parts were usually bidirectional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the pre-FFT time domain signals, the highest frequency parts presented distorted, amplitude-modulated sine waves, and the low-frequency parts presented totally irregular waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The amplitudes of the low-frequency parts diminished with time in the proximal channel but enlarged with time in the distal channel over a short period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MESs recorded from <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses may have special characteristics of multiple frequencies on both post-FFT spectra and pre-FFT time domain signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings may represent rotating or vibrating emboli as they are just dislodged from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and are moving from the vessel wall to the center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further clinical and laboratory studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
