<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study transesophageal echocardiography was performed in 53 consecutive patients with non valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and a previous embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the group of 31 patients with a positive scan 9 patients with no history of a previous ischemic attack were found </plain></SENT>
