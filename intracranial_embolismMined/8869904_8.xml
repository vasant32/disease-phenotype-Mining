<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine the association between anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, we investigated the serum titers of aCL antibodies in a total 252 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients recruited in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> which were not attributable to any causes other than SLE were identified after being followed-up for five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations were recorded and blood samples were tested for the presence of aCL antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA isotypes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, 12 (57.1%), 2 (9.5%) and 2 (9.5%), respectively, had elevated baseline serum levels of IgG, IgM and IgA aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a dose-response relationship between risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and the baseline serum level of aCL antibodies (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> were 3.7 for those who had a high level of aCL antibodies compared with those without a detectable level of aCL antibodies as the referent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> as a primary neuropsychiatric event among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients is associated with a high titer of aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
