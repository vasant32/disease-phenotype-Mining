<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, predictors of therapeutic outcome with respect to (a) reperfusion and (b) tissue recovery would be very useful to identify potentially salvageable brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) parameters, especially the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and T(2) relaxometry are thought to provide this information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prognostic implications of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, PWI and T(2) relaxometry immediately before initiation of thrombolytic treatment in a model of clot embolism in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals (n = 14) were treated with intraarterial rt-PA (10 mg/kg) at 90 min after embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was repeatedly performed at 4.7 T before and up to 5.5 h after embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was calculated from diffusion-weighted images (b-values: 30, 765, 1500 s/mm(2)), arterial spin tagging was used for PWI, and quantitative T(2) relaxometry was performed with a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A reperfusion index was calculated to assess the quality of thrombolytic recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The decline of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> at the end of the experiment to below 80% of control was defined as unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probability of tissue injury at the end of the experiments increased with the severity of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> changes before the initiation of treatment (probability of unfavorable outcome: 21%, 44%, 65% for <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values of 80-90%, 70-80% and &lt;70% of control, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment PWI or T(2) relaxometry also correlated with outcome but-alone or in combination with pretreatment <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps-did not improve injury prediction over that obtained by <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Outcome was influenced positively by successful reperfusion the quality of which, however, could not be predicted by pre-treatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> mapping performed before the initiation of thrombolytic treatment provides reliable risk assessment of impeding brain injury but due to uncertainties of postischemic reperfusion does not allow precise outcome prediction in individual experiments </plain></SENT>
