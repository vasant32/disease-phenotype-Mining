<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Peripheral embolism is frequently related to a cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a useful tool for identifying such sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our laboratory has gained wide experience in TEE, with a large number of exams performed to search for a cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore thought it would be useful to present our experience in the last 12 years following the introduction of the technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 1110 consecutive patients undergoing TEE to search for a cardiac source of embolism, after an embolic event and a transthoracic echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 53 +/- 14 years, 52% male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was peripheral embolism in 5% of cases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in the remainder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The exam identified a potential embolic source in 35.6% of cases, the most frequent diagnoses being intracardiac shunt at the atrial level (9.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) (6.6%), intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> (6.4%) and atherosclerotic plaques in the thoracic aorta (9.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (27%), which was more frequent in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, we identified a cardiac source of embolism more often in elderly patients, with a predominance of atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ETE was more frequently diagnostic in patients with peripheral embolism, but there were no differences in terms of etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TEE is very useful to search for cardiac sources of embolism, especially in younger patients, in whom causes potentially treatable surgically or percutaneously can be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In elderly patients, therapeutic strategy will probably not be changed by the findings (mostly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and atherosclerotic plaques) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and embolic events makes it essential to perform a thorough search by TEE for intracardiac shunts, which are frequently associated </plain></SENT>
