<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had no significant medical history other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi>, and she had had multiple previous ECT treatments without any complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While being monitored in the recovery room within 10 minutes after the last ECT session, she was found to have sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of left-sided flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and numbness along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001350'>slurred speech</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On arrival to our hospital, she was found to have flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> on the left side involving the face, arm, and leg (face and arm more than the leg involvement), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, and mild neglect syndrome (National Health Institute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale of 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no signs of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> contrast CT angiography revealed right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) (distal M1 segment) clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient received intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen (rt-PA) at 2.5 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, and then a total of 3.0 mg of intra-arterial (IA) rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiography at the end of the procedure showed successful recanalization of the M1 segment and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessel caliber with adequate distal flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, the patient made rapid improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of her initial symptoms during the first 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> workup failed to reveal any cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including usual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and hypercoagulable risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> immediately following an ECT, and without the aggressive thrombolytic therapy, the patient's outcome would have been poor because there was an M1 segment clot with a major <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> syndrome with relatively high National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The neurological side effect profile of ECT is reported to be minimal with most common symptoms being <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo>, and memory complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is no clear cause-and-effect relationship in this case, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after ECT is extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In such rare event of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> while receiving ECT, there is an effective treatment available using both intravenous and IA thrombolysis as reported in this case </plain></SENT>
