<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This was a prospective single-center study to assess and analyze cerebral embolization resulting from carotid artery stenting with neuroprotective filter devices in patients considered as poor surgical candidates for surgical carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients with an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were treated by placement of carotid Wallstents with two different types of temporary distal filter protection devices: the Spider filter and the FilterWire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) of the brain was obtained 24 hours before the procedure and within 5 to 30 hours after the procedure to detect ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> resulting from the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were symptomatic (&gt; or =70%) or asymptomatic (&gt; or =80%) stenoses in surgical high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two (4%) regressive minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprocedural DWI detected new focal ischemic lesions in 21 patients (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average number of lesions was 5.9 per patient, and the mean lesion volume was 1 mL or less in 19 patients (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small differences were found in the lesion distribution: homolateral anterior circulation in eight cases (15.1%), other vascular territories in seven cases (13.2%), and homolateral anterior circulation plus other vascular territories in six cases (11.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The microembolization risk seemed nonpredictable on the basis of clinical parameters and internal carotid artery lesion characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increased risk in the rate of ipsilateral hemispheric embolization has been observed in difficult carotid arch implantations (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of new focal ischemic lesions detected by DWI is higher than expected on the basis of previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Embolization from the aortic arch or common carotid arteries could account for most of those events in patients considered as surgical high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although 90% of the events were clinically silent, this high rate of microembolization raises questions about the possible consequences on cerebral cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
