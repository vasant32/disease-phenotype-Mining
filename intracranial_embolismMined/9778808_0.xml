<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous cortical SD waves occurring during illumination were found to delay the irreversible <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was probably prevented by episodes of striking vasodilation and hyperemia lasting for 1-2 min and accompanying every SD wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SD-induced hyperemia after permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion seems to improve the oxygen supply of the penumbra zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> induced by one-hour respiration with 0.8% CO, COHb saturation of the blood reached 50-60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SD waves occurred in different brain regions of lightly anesthetized rats (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>, 20 mg/kg) changed under the above conditions into prolonged depolarizations (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HDs</z:e>) which led to a substantial increase in animals' mortality (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SDs evoked in the cortex and hippocampus of deeply anesthetized rats (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>, 50 mg/kg) showed that hippocampus became highly vulnerable by CO <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duration of the SD-provoked <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HDs</z:e> often reached 30-60 min after a single SD wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreased cell density was found in CA1 area of the hippocampus 20-30 days after the CD-enhanced CO <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebrolysin (2.5 ml/kg daily, during 10 days) prevented from severe hippocampal injury (formation of granulomas) usually seen in the left hemisphere of rats not treated with cerebrolysin </plain></SENT>
