<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies (acLa) are associated with a thrombotic tendency (often involving cerebral ischemic events), are frequently present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and have been found together with cardiac valve abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies evaluated patients characterized by the presence of acLa or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, precluding assessment of the frequency of acLa in those with valvular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to establish the prevalence of acLa in patients with valve disease in the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> and, furthermore, to determine the influence of acLa on the risk of cerebral events in valve disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven consecutive patients with mitral or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, or both, prospectively underwent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M acLa, as did 24 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AcLa values greater than or equal to 3 SD above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean were considered "positive." Prior cerebral events were defined retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 87 patients with valvular disease, 26 had positive IgG acLa levels compared with 0 of 24 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AcLa values did not vary with valve disease etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Focal cerebral events had occurred in 8 patients and were embolic or probably embolic in 7, including 7 of 26 IgG acLa-positive and 1 of 60 IgG acLa-negative patients (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, IgG acLa is highly prevalent among patients with aortic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, or both; this association may indicate a relatively high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
