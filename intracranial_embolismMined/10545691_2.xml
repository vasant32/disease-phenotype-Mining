<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 45-year-old man with congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0001575'>cyanotic</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, elevated haematocrit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet count</z:hpo> and decreased protein C and protein S activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and following several haemodilutions, we performed 5 1-hour transcranial Doppler recordings from one or both middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) on different days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of microembolic signals per hour varied from 54 to 134 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the bilateral recording, the microemboli occurred on both sides (55 in the right and 45 in the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no relation to red blood cell count, platelet count, the spontaneously lowered prothrombin time or the spontaneously <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The origin of the large number of microembolic signals found in this patient remains unclear, but may be presumed in the intra-abdominal or crural venous system </plain></SENT>
