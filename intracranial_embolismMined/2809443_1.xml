<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The investigators conducted a study of low dose aspirin and antithrombotic effectiveness in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> at Siriraj hospital Medical School, Mahidol University from July 1986 to June 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients, 27 males and 9 females were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ages of the patients ranged from 33 to 80 years with a mean age of 55 +/- 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven per cent of patients had hyperfunction of platelet before treatment which fell to 3 and 0 per cent 24 hours and 7 days after low dose aspirin treatment (75 mg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The platelet count was significantly increased to compensate its hypofunction after seven days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no change in euglobulin lysis time, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> level in platelet after low dose aspirin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma prostacyclin in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients was statistically significantly reduced in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (223.8 pg/ml); but there was no further suppression of plasma prostacyclin after low dose aspirin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude that low dose aspirin (75 mg/d) is effective for antithrombotic effect in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without any suppression of prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We do recommend low dose aspirin for recurrent ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylaxis as it has fewer side effects, is cheap, easily administered and effective </plain></SENT>
