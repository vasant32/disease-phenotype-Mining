<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 112 consecutive patients within 72 hours of admission to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary care unit using TCD to monitor for cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were excluded because of failure of ultrasound insonation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had 2-dimensional echocardiograms within the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HITS were detected in 17% of patients, with significantly higher frequency in patients with reduced (&lt;65%) left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (P=0 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A marginally significant (P=0.059) increase of HITS was found in patients with anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was significantly more frequent in patients with cerebral microemboli (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HITS were detected in 17% of patients in spite of adequate antithrombotic therapy and were increased in patients with reduced LV function, akinetic myocardial segments, and LV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
