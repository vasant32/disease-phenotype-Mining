<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> with cerebral oncotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 37 year-old woman was admitted complaining of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, and episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination on admission revealed a right arm monoparesis, a right hemisensory disturbance, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002427'>motor aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated low density areas in the left fronto-parietal region, and multiple discrete enhancing high density spots scattered bilaterally in the parietal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed multiple fusiform peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> especially in the distribution of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral emboli</z:e> from the cardiac source were suspected, and an echocardiography was performed, which disclosed a huge villous mass in the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cardiac mass was resected uneventfully under cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It proved to be a left <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, her neurological deficit persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumor</z:e>, follow-up angiographies were undertaken twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The second angiography performed 6 months later revealed spontaneous resolution or stabilization of most of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> detected before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, newly-developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were seen at the sites which had seemed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> previously on the first angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No remarkable changes were seen on the third one except the slight enlargement of one of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the middle cerebral territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At 3 years she was neurologically stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because of the paucity of knowledge concerning the natural history of cerebral oncotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and lack of definite treatment for them, long-term follow-up including serial angiography is mandatory after the resection of left <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
