<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>Right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> through a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> is frequently diagnosed by contrast echocardiography and can be particularly prominent in the presence of elevated pressures in the right side of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its prognostic significance in patients with pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, however, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The present prospective study included 139 consecutive patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> diagnosed on the basis of clinical, echocardiographic, and cardiac catheterization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent contrast echocardiography at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The end points of the study were overall mortality and complicated clinical course during the hospital stay defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, cerebral or peripheral arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, or need for endotracheal intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>Patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 48 patients (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of 33% as opposed to 14% in patients with a negative echo-contrast examination (P=.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the only independent predictors of mortality in the study population were a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 11.4; P&lt;.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>arterial hypotension</z:hpo> at presentation (OR, 26.3; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> also had a significantly higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (13% versus 2.2%; P=.02) and peripheral arterial embolism (15 versus 0%; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the risk of a complicated in-hospital course was 5.2 times higher in this patient group (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, echocardiographic detection of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> signifies a particularly high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and arterial thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
