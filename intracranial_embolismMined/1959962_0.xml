<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NE efflux was significantly greater (P less than 0.001) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (34.09 +/- 4.92% at 30 min and 50.45 +/- 7.1% at 60 min) as compared to controls (23.27 +/- 4.16% at 30 min and 39.49 +/- 3.27% at 60 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This excessive efflux may result in increased concentrations of NE in local plasma, which by causing enhanced platelet aggregation and damage to vascular endothelium and vasospasm, may contribute towards the development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
