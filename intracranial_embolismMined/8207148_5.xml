<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The charts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with diving-related accidents presenting between 1983 and 1991 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals who sustained a neurologic deficit attributable to occlusion of part of the cerebral circulation within 10 minutes of surfacing from a dive and who had a depth time profile less than 80% of the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Navy "no-stop" limits were considered to have had an arterial gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their records were reviewed to determine the hematocrit upon first presentation and the final hematocrit prior to discharge or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had hematocrit determinations on more than one occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease from initial to final hematocrit for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No source of significant blood loss was identified in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between the magnitude of the fall in hematocrit and the eventual neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that gas embolism diagnosed using the above criteria produces hemoconcentration, and the degree of hemoconcentration correlates with the severity of the gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the pathophysiology of gas embolism is more complex than previously thought and must include diffuse endothelial injury resulting in leak of fluid from the intravascular space </plain></SENT>
