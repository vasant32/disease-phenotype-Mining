<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Massive arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is a rare but devastating complication of cardiac operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several treatment modalities have been proposed, but hyperbaric oxygen is the specific therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Israel Naval Medical Institute is the only referral hyperbaric center in this country for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience in the hyperbaric oxygen treatment of massive arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> during cardiac operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients were treated between 1985 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (47.1%) experienced a complete neurologic recovery; 6 patients (35.3%) remained unconscious at discharge, and 3 patients (17.6%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean (+/- SD) delay from the end of the operation to hyperbaric therapy was 9.6 +/- 7.4 hours (range, 1-20 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This delay was 4.0 +/- 3.4 hours (1-12 hours) for patients who had a full neurologic recovery, 12.8 +/- 7.1 hours (5-20 hours) for patients with severe neurologic disability, and 18.0 +/- 2.0 hours (16-20 hours) for patients who died (1-way analysis of variance; P =.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The source of variance among the groups mainly resulted from the short delay for patients who experienced complete recovery compared with the other 2 groups (Tukey test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 patients who were treated within 3 hours from the operation and 50% (2 of 4 patients) of those patients treated 3 to 5 hours from operation experienced a full neurologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a delay of 9 to 20 hours, only 1 of 8 patients had a full neurologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association between outcome and treatment delay was found to be statistically significant (tau = 0.65 with exact 2-sided P value =.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy should be administered as soon as possible after massive arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> during cardiac operations </plain></SENT>
