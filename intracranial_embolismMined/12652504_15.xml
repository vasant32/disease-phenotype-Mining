<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Carotid sinus reactions (CSR), defined as <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> &gt;/= 3 sec and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (systolic blood pressure &lt;/= 90 mm Hg), are frequent events during carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factors predisposing a patient to CSR as well as the impact of CSR on periprocedural complications have not yet been investigated in a prospective manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between various clinical, morphologic, and procedural variables and the occurrence of CSR was examined among 105 consecutive patients undergoing successful CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After predilatation with a compliant balloon, tubular-slotted stents were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No CSR occurred in 63 (60%) patients, whereas CSR developed in 42 (40%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common type of CSR was <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> in combination with short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> without clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most important predictor of CSR was bifurcation location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (bifurcation &gt; ostial &gt; isolated internal carotid artery; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other independent predictors were presence of contralateral stenosis (P &lt; 0.02), length of stenosis (P &lt; 0.03), and balloon-to-artery ratio (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of CSR was unrelated to periprocedural cerebral or cardiovascular complications (7.1% vs. 9.5%; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CSR occurs frequently (40%) during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bifurcation location of stenosis is the most important predictor of CSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CSR does not increase the risk of periprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
