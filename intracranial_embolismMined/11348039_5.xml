<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic studies were performed in 82 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, nonrheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups according to F wave amplitude in lead V1 on the 12-lead ECG: coarse AF (the greatest amplitude of F wave &gt; or =1 mm, n=44) and fine AF (&lt;1 mm, n=38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex, D-dimer, platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with coarse AF, those with fine AF had lower LAA peak flow velocity (p&lt;0.05) and higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262004" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic cerebral infarction</z:e> (50% vs 27%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet activity did not differ between the 2 groups; however, plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex and D-dimer were significantly higher in patients with fine AF than in those with coarse AF (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that fine AF was independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the presence of fine F wave in V1 would be a useful marker of LAA dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo>, and indicate a risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, nonrheumatic AF </plain></SENT>
