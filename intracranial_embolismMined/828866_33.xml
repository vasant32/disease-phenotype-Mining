<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lesion was occipital in 8 instances (infarction 7, porencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> 1), parietooccipital in 3 (infarction 2, <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> 1) and probably parietal in 2 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> 1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disorder involved the right hemisphere in 9 cases, the left hemisphere in 3 cases and both hemispheres sequentially in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>Hallucinations</z:hpo> were accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233652" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">palinopsia</z:e> in 2 cases, metamorphopsia in one case and constriction of one pupil in another case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This particular type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucination</z:hpo> is considered as an irritative phenomenon of the visual association cortex which can be symptomatic of a parieto-occipital lesion and does not necessarily implicate the temporal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distinctive features about the visions were that they consisted of people, animals or objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no auditory accompaniment and any action that took place was stereotyped and did not tell a story </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> were not clearly related to any visual memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the visual association cortex amy be responsible for the organization of visual percepts into broad categories of which people, animals and objects are representative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> suggests that the cells of the association cortex are more likely to discharge spontaneously once they are deprived of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> afferent inflow from the calcarine cortex </plain></SENT>
