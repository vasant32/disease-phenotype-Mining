<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring of the middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity was used as an adjunct to routine methods of cerebral monitoring in a prospective study of 30 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy to investigate whether transcranial Doppler monitoring provided information influencing operative technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Application of carotid clamps caused a significant fall in middle cerebral artery velocity and there was a linear relationship between middle cerebral artery velocity and internal carotid artery stump pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assuming a stump pressure of less than 50 mmHg to be an indication for shunting, this would correspond to a systolic middle cerebral artery velocity of less than 42 cm/s and a mean velocity of less than 30 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring immediately identified problems with shunt function and demonstrated a higher frequency of intraoperative embolization than had been anticipated, particularly after shunt insertion and final restoration of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With revision of operative technique this phenomenon is rarely encountered now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the 30 patients exhibited a minor neurological deficit on recovery of consciousness, and transcranial Doppler monitoring was able to identify the probable underlying cause in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unnecessary and potentially hazardous re-exploration was avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the absence of transcranial Doppler monitoring the neurological deficit in one of the patients might have been much worse </plain></SENT>
