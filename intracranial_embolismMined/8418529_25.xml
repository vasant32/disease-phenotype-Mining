<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The detection of circulating particulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography has been recently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that this method might allow discrimination between different embolic materials; this would be very useful for selecting specific pharmacological treatment in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to identify those parameters of the Doppler signal that might prove useful in discriminating between different types and sizes of particulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An extracorporeal circuit filled with a saline/Tween solution and driven by a peristaltic pump was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The tubing was placed in a skull in the position of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using transcranial Doppler ultrasound, flow was insonated via the transtemporal window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following embolic materials of measured sizes (range of maximum dimension, 0.5-5.0 mm) were introduced into the circuit: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (n = 20), platelet-rich aggregates (n = 15), atheromatous material (n = 20), and fat (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Doppler signal was recorded during the passage of each <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Off-line analysis was performed to measure the maximum amplitude and duration of the signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> embolic materials there was a highly significant relation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> size and maximum amplitude of the Doppler signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The closest correlation was obtained when the logarithm of maximum amplitude was used (for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, r = 0.74; for platelet, r = 0.87; for atheroma, r = 0.46; and for fat, r = 0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The slope of the regression line differed for the different embolic materials and was significantly steeper for platelets than for atheroma (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Platelet emboli of maximum dimension &lt; or = 1.5 mm resulted in a significantly lower maximum amplitude than similarly sized atheroma emboli (157 dB versus 206.7 dB, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For larger emboli (&gt; 2 mm) there was little further increase in maximum amplitude with increases in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> embolic materials there was a highly significant linear relation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> size and duration of the high-amplitude (&gt; 150 dB) signal (for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, r = 0.75; for platelet, r = 0.90; for atheroma, r = 0.77; and for fat, r = 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Platelet emboli result in lower-amplitude signals, and therefore analysis of maximum amplitude may provide information on the type of embolic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, it may be difficult to determine whether a given signal is associated with a large platelet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> or a small atheroma <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Duration of the high-amplitude signal will allow accurate estimation of the size of emboli, particularly where the emboli are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the same material </plain></SENT>
