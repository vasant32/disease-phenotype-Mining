<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From January to June 1994 reconstruction of 61 internal carotid arteries (ICA) with cerebral monitoring using bilateral transcranial Doppler sonography in the Clinic of Vascular Surgery Charit√© was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recording of the maximal mean blood flow velocity in both middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was performed intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After clamping of ICA flow velocity in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> decreased immediately but recovered within short time in 60% of our patients (Vmean &gt; 25 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the reaction of the contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> 3 types were differentiated: 1) Vmean of the contralateral side changed contrary to the ipsilateral side (compensation, "scissors type") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2) The contralateral side did not react ("indifferent type") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3) The contralateral side changed parallel to the ipsilateral side ("parallel type") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 62% of our patients the operative strategy was influenced by transcranial Doppler monitoring: in 35% of cases the operative reconstruction was performed without intraluminal shunting, in 19% of cases the position of the intraluminal shunt was corrected, in 8% of cases the blood pressure was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Doppler signals due to emboli were registered in 43% of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These patients did not show any new neurologic signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient who developed a neurological deficit during the postoperative phase, emboli signals were recorded during a period of 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bilateral transcranial Doppler monitoring, especially in patients with contralateral high-grade stenoses or occlusions of the ICA, is a useful method for intraoperative cerebral monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend its application on a wide scale </plain></SENT>
