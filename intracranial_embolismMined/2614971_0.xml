<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, cardiogenic embolism was one of major problems in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On CT, size of the ischemic region, mass effect and frequency of hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were most prominent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
