<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Delayed clinical presentation weeks, months, and even years after the injury is rare, but has important diagnostic, therapeutic and forensic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current era, where computed tomography is replacing angiography as the main diagnostic procedure, it is extremely important to keep this diagnosis in mind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 31-years-old male patient, who did well after a motorcycle accident with head and neck injury for six years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since then he only showed left-side <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo>, which unfortunately was ignored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 1993 the patient developed occlusion of central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery, and after a therapy with streptokinase he presented with right-side palsy and complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT-scan revealed a large edematous infarction in the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transfemoral digital subtraction angiography however demonstrated a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left extracranial internal carotid artery as the source of intracranial embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe sequelae of this kind can only be warded of by early diagnosis and proper surgical therapy of vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore even minimal symptoms suggesting the possibility of a traumatic injury to the carotid artery are recommending timely angiographic investigation </plain></SENT>
