<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of models of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> have been created to mimic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present series of experiments, we report our observations on the thrombin model of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and the neuroprotective effects of intraarterial thrombolysis with two doses of urokinase (2500 and 5000 units/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experiments male Wistar rats were used and the animals were allowed to recover for 48 h before assessment of neurobehavioral performance on a four-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of cerebral hemispheric damage was calculated as the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> using TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was effected by the introduction of an autologous blood clot into the internal carotid artery (ICA) approximately 2 mm from the origin of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This clot was formed by the drawing of 10 microl of blood into a bovine thrombin (20 microg per animal) containing intraarterial catheter, which was inserted into the right ECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After standing for 15 min to allow clot formation, the catheter was advanced gently through the ICA to the site of injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion produced a consistent large infarction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urokinase infusion (i.a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>) was started 2 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in the initial series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In animals treated with low dose urokinase infusion there was mild protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with high dose urokinase infusion showed a highly significant improvement in the motor recovery and a decrease in the extent of infarction compared to control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the final group, the infusion of urokinase was delayed for 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While producing protection in some animals, it also produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in two of eight animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus delay of infusion to 180 min increased the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This model may in the future be used to test the protective effects of combination therapy with thrombolysis and neuroprotective medications </plain></SENT>
