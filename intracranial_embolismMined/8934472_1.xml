<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cases with poor colateral circulation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> develops more severely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these cases, quick recanalization of the occluded cerebral artery is necessary to prevent severe hemorrhagic infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a case where interventional techniques were used to bring about quick recanalization of occluded cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We encountered a case of a sixty-year-old male who experienced complete occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery due to an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was very hard to pass a guide wire through the embolic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At first, we tried mild local fibrinolysis therapy using tissue plasminogen activator, but we could not get any recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, after mild local fibrinolysis therapy, the guide wire could be passed through the occlusion point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we tried percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) with 2.0mm diameter angioplastic balloon using up to five atomic pressures, after which we obtained partial recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally we achieved total recanalization of the middle cerebral artery by <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> with a 2.5mm diameter angioplastic balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We crushed this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> using the angioplastic balloon with up to six atomic pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The point of the techniques is to press the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> against the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After this angioplasty, there was an occlusion of the common trunk of the posterior parietal artery and the angular artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However there was neither massive hemorrhagic infarction nor massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> on follow up CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the cerebral artery due to embolism, we found <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> is very effective against the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the future, we need to develop a retrieving device and a balloon that will prevent the production of small emboli during the crush process involved when bringing about recanalization using <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
