<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients are suitable for such a study because they have a high incidence of arterial emboli derived mainly from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> formed on the valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were given either 1 Gm. of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> daily or placebo in combination with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, and were observed for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only two emboli occurred in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, none of them severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group 12 thromboembolic episodes were diagnosed in 10 patients, and three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> died; in one a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> unrelated to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, one fatal and the one nonfatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> occurred in each group, whereas gastrointestinal complications were seen more frequently in patients taking <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> combined with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> offered a significantly better protection against arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> than did <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy alone </plain></SENT>
