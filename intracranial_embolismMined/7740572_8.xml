<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the angiographic correlates of such embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Doppler signals from 48 MCAs in 26 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> that was either symptomatic (n = 20) or asymptomatic (n = 6) were recorded for 40 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and the ulcerated or nonulcerated appearance of the plaque were assessed using the criteria of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Embolic signals were detected in 8 MCAs from 7 patients; 4 (50%) of these <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were clinically symptomatic compared with 16 (40%) without embolic signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there was a trend toward more severe stenosis in the cases with embolic signals, this was not significant (mean +/- SD, 67 +/- 29% versus 55 +/- 36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an image of ulceration was found on ipsilateral carotid angiography in 5 cases (63%) with embolic signals and in only 9 cases (23%) without embolic signals (odds ratio, 5.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 28.79, by multivariate regression analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the occurrence of embolic signals in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is associated with the appearance of plaque ulceration on angiography </plain></SENT>
