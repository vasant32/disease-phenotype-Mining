<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied 20 patients who underwent diagnostic cerebral angiographic examinations and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had DWI before and after their angiogram, whereas two patients had a DWI only after their angiogram (DWI was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in both of these patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No clinical neurological deficits were detected in any of our patients after angiography, but in three of 20 patients there was a new hyperintense signal abnormality found on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted MRI provides an objective means of detecting both clinical and subclinical neurological events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging might therefore provide an easier method of assessing complication rates in cerebral angiography by reducing the number of patients required for meaningful statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
