<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An illustrative case is reported of a 6-year-old boy suffering from right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> of the neck in which permanent balloon occlusion of the right ACI was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the procedure, repeated severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> with temporary occlusion of the M1 segment of the ACM could be detected by TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complications could then be avoided by cessation of the undertaking and lysis therapy with urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The report concludes that TCD monitoring during endovascular treatment provides important insight into the thromboembolic pathophysiology, guides management strategies, helps in the avoidance of devastating events and should be performed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> interventional procedures, as well as during balloon occlusion of the ACI </plain></SENT>
