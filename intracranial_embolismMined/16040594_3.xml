<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound can detect asymptomatic emboli in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current systems are nonportable and can only record for short durations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A novel ambulatory TCD system allows prolonged recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We applied this to patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> to determine patterns of embolization in the 2 conditions and optimal recording protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ambulatory TCD recordings were performed in 12 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (&gt; or =50%) patients for 8 hours and then repeated on a second occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine (75%) of symptomatic subjects had embolic signals during the first recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this group, repeating the recording did not increase the proportion of positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In asymptomatic patients, 4 (26.7%) had embolic signals on 1 recording, and this proportion increased to 46.7% after 2 recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was significant clustering of embolic signals demonstrating that the process was nonrandom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory TCD is possible in patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By increasing the duration of recording, additional information is provided, particularly in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results also demonstrate clustering of embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study provides baseline data to allow studies in both asymptomatic and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> to be planned </plain></SENT>
