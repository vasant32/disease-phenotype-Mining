<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The outcomes of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) are, in addition to patient baseline characteristics, highly dependent on the safety of the endovascular procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the successive stages of CAS, transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of the middle cerebral artery was used to assess the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and hemodynamic changes with transient (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>) and persistent (minor and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) cerebral deficits, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By use of a prospectively completed database of 550 patients, the association of various TCD emboli and velocity variables with periprocedural cerebral outcome &lt;or=7 days was evaluated by univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses in combination with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impact of basic patient characteristics, such as age, sex, preprocedural cerebral symptoms, and ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy before CAS was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed 36 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> (n = 6; 1.1%) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (n = 30; 5.4%), 1 patient (0.2%) with an ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and 21 patients with minor (n = 15; 2.7%) or major (n = 6; 1.1%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients (0.9%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple showers of microemboli (&gt;5) at postdilation after stent deployment (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 5.1), particulate macroembolus (OR, 27.0; 95% CI, 4.5 to 157), and massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> (OR, 51.4; 95% CI, 5.4 to 492), as well as angioplasty-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> with a &gt;70% reduction of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities (OR, 6.4; 95% CI, 2.3 to 17.8) were independently associated with cerebral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ROC area of this model was 0.72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patient characteristics, only preprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.4 to 10.4) was associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adding this patient characteristic to the model, the area under the ROC curve increased to 0.80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In CAS, in addition to such obviously adverse events as particulate macroembolism and massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>, multiple microemboli (&gt;5 showers) at postdilation after stent deployment and angioplasty-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> with a significant reduction of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities are associated with periprocedural cerebral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In combination with the presence of preprocedural cerebral symptoms, these four TCD monitoring variables reasonably differentiate between patients with and without adverse cerebral outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring provides insight into the pathogenesis of CAS related adverse cerebral events </plain></SENT>
