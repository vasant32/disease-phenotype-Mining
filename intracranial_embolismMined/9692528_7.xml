<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no study has focused on LAA function in conjunction with left atrial (LA) function in both sinus rhythm (SR) and nonrheumatic idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in relation to clinical status (cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients in SR (14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 29 control subjects) and 45 patients in AF (27 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 18 control subjects) were examined by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical characteristics and standard transthoracic and transesophageal measurements of the LA and LAA (size, fractional area change, flow measurements, spontaneous echo contrast, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>) were recorded and compared in relation to cardiac rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-SR group showed a significant decrease of fractional area change in the LA (32%+/-15%) and LAA (34%+/-15%) in relation to control subjects (43%+/-10%, p = 0.035, 49%+/-13%, p = 0.006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-AF group showed significant reduction of appendage flow measurements (outward velocity = 22+/-13 vs 33+/-19 cm/sec, p = 0.036), whereas no differences were detected in the center of the LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis, the presence of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was positively associated with the presence of spontaneous echo contrast (p = 0.0253) and spontaneous echo contrast negatively associated with appendage inward flow velocity (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients in SR is associated with a global decrease of shortening in both cavities and in patients with AF, with a reduction of LAA flow parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with spontaneous echo contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, or both showed further reduction of shortening and flow velocities in both cavities, indicating a more advanced stage of dysfunction </plain></SENT>
