<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identical design and implantation procedures were used with two different surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 10 anticoagulated calves receiving Dacron-fibrilized <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> rubber surfaces survived an average of 296 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the 10 nonanticoagulated calves with smooth poyurethane hearts survived 545 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi> surfaces were constantly clean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the rough surfaces were coated with variable amounts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sharp angle between the diaphragm and housing contained varying amounts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> deposits in 75 per cent of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombe deposition occurred on 41 per cent of the valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These thrombe were the source of emboli into the kidney, brain, and lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Turbulences and stagnation areas generated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
