<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multichannel EEG, cerebral oximetry, and transcranial Doppler ultrasound were used to detect and correct imbalances in cerebral perfusion and oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imbalances were detected in 59% of the cases and successfully corrected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of neuromonitoring, the expected incidence of serious brain injury is 6.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With neuromonitoring, the actual observed incidence was 3.0% (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The apparent improvement can be attributed primarily to a reduction in the number of nonembolic diffuse injuries </plain></SENT>
