<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) image demonstrated an onion-skin-like, laminated structure within a calcified wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The laminated structure had developed around an old <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, without any communication to the flowing blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It showed intensities indicating recent clots, revealing that the giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had grown by recurrent intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rather than by intraluminal accumulation of thrombotic materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates that totally thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> still have the potential of growth </plain></SENT>
