<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Due to its location in the chest wall, surgical treatment of lesions at the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk or common carotid artery (CCA) is unattractive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete endovascular treatment of lesions at the origin of the common carotid artery or brachiochephalic trunk combined with high-grade lesions at the carotid bifurcation carries a high risk for distal emboli before cerebral protection is installed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the combination of open carotid endarterectomy with retrograde stenting of the proximal lesion through one stage is most attractive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients were treated with a combined procedure for tandem lesions at the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk or common carotid artery (CCA) and the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endpoint of this evaluation was the 30-day MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were finished as planned and no conversion was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a restenosis after only 4 days for which he underwent a re-<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day MACE was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients needed additional treatment during follow-up (mean follow-up 33 months; range: 11 to 60) although one patient developed a non-significant stenosis during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment of tandem lesions of the carotid artery is safe and effective in the long-term </plain></SENT>
