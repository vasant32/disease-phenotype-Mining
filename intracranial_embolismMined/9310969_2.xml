<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) is accepted as a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of stenotic arterial lesions of various sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, distal embolism may cause serious complications in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> of cephalic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By monitoring embolic signals using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography, we speculated regarding the safety and/or risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for vertebral and subclavian <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve consecutive patients undergoing <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for subclavian and vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> of atherosclerotic origin were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were refractory to initial medical treatment and were considered for <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were heparinized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before, during, and after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, TCD monitoring was performed to detect embolic signals for 30 minutes at each time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and antiplatelet therapies were continued in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before, during, and after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, a steady flow signal could be obtained from each vertebral artery monitored using TCD ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No embolic signals were detected in any patient before angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During angioplasty, one embolic signal was detected immediately after balloon deflation in 1 of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several embolic signals were detected after the procedure in 6 of 12 patients, but thereafter embolic signals became less frequent in number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three days after angioplasty, embolic signals were not detected in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no serious complications caused by the <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TCD monitoring may be a useful modality for detection of microemboli during and after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We suspected that subclinical microemboli are released from the dilated vessels for 3 days after vertebral and subclavian <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or antiplatelet therapies may prevent embolic complications after the procedure </plain></SENT>
