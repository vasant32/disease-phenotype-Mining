<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission, we started combined administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, vitamin E, phenytoin (Sendai Cocktail) and perfluorochemicals to protect ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Left cerebral angiography revealed occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery involving its perforating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following the performance of angiography, vascular balloon catheter was introduced into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, and fibrinolytic agent (urokinase) was continuously injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Soon after the injection of 240,000 unit urokinase, recanalization of left middle cerebral artery was shown by repeated cerebral angiography performed 5.5 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On his clinical course, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> were improved step by step, and 1 week later, he could walk by himself with minor neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further examination revealed that <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> was located on left atrium by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within 1 week, the patient was transferred to cardio-surgical unit, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> was successfully removed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Usually <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> result from <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> cause severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here we reported a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> by <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> and recanalized using fibrinolytic agent by balloon catheter injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The damage will be reduced if the duration of occlusion is limited, so this method will be helpful to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
