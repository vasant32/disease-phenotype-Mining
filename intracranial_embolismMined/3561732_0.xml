<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In some cases, basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> cannot be repaired surgically and the basilar artery is occluded near the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to stop flow into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the operation, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> can fill only by flow through the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamically if the flow were the same in both PCoAs and there were no phase lag in the pressures, there would be no pressure gradient for flow to go across the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and therefore the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> would thrombose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have assumed that the diameter of the artery is roughly proportional to the flow that goes through it chronically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured the diameters of the PCoAs in 25 patients who had hunterian ligation of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also measured the maximal width, height, and depth of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> on angiograms obtained before and after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> thrombosed completely and had a diameter ratio of greater than 0.6; 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> thrombosed partially and had a diameter ratio of 0.46 approximately 1.0; 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> did not change and had a diameter ratio of less than 0.45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the sizes of the PCoAs pre- and postoperatively was comparable in most cases, so we believe that it is possible to predict reasonably accurately from this simple measurement whether the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is likely to thrombose if the basilar artery is ligated </plain></SENT>
