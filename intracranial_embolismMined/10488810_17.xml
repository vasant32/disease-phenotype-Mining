<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between timing to heparinization and functional outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Consecutive case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: In 231 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, intravenous or subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> administered with the goal of achieving an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 1.5 to 2.0 times control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delay to the initiation of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy was less than 6 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms in 74 patients and between 6 and 48 hours in 157 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome (Rankin scale) was assessed 9 +/- 3 (mean +/- SD) days from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> using multivariate analysis and including in the model treatment delay, risk factors (eg, age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>), initial neurological severity, and baseline computed tomographic findings (eg, early signs of infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms on admission (Mathew score) and baseline radiological findings were evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rate was assessed on subsequent computed tomographic (CT) scans (obtained 7 +/- 2 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relationship between APTT ratios and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence or hemorrhagic worsening was also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional outcome at hospital discharge and incidence of early recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality (9%), hemorrhagic worsening (3.4%), and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence (2.1%) occurred in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complete recovery was associated with age younger than 70 years (odds ratio [OR], 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05-0.70), a baseline Mathew score higher than 74 (OR, 11.5; 95% CI, 4.95-26.70), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> baseline CT findings (OR, 8.86; CI, 3.99-19.60), and early heparinization (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.10-2.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Targeted APTT ratios were achieved at 24 hours in fewer than 50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence was associated with lower mean APTT ratios, higher mean APTT ratios were observed in patients with symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, especially on the day of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Age, admission <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, blood pressure, and baseline CT findings did not predict hemorrhagic worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Delaying anticoagulation in alert patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is not endorsed by the initial severity of symptoms or the early signs of infarction on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery is improved the sooner <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> also has therapeutic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, close APTT monitoring is warranted to lessen the incidence of untoward complications </plain></SENT>
