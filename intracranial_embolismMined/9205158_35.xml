<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As operative mortality for coronary artery bypass grafting has decreased, greater attention has focused on neurobehavioral complications of coronary artery bypass grafting and cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To assess risk factors and to evaluate changes in surgical technique, between 1991 and 1994 we evaluated 395 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an 11-part neurobehavioral battery administered preoperatively and at 1 and 6 weeks postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were instrumented with 5-MHz focused continuous-wave carotid Doppler transducers intraoperatively to estimate cerebral microembolism as an instantaneous perturbation of the velocity signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microembolism data were quantitated and compared with surgical technical maneuvers during operation and with neurobehavioral deficit (&gt; or = 20% decline from preoperative performance on two or more neurobehavioral tests) postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data and patient demographics were statistically analyzed (chi2, t test) and the results at 2 years (1991 and 1992; group A) were used to influence surgical technique in 1993 and 1994 (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly associated with new neurobehavioral deficits were increasing patient age (p &lt; 0.05), more than 100 emboli per case (p &lt; 0.04), and palpable aortic plaque (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group B patients had a significant decline in the neurobehavioral event rate (group A, 69%, 140/203; versus group B, 60%, 115/192; p &lt; 0.05) of postoperative neurobehavioral deficits at 1 week and at 1 month (group A, 29%, 52/180; versus group B, 18%, 35/198; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was less than 2% in both groups (p = not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Modifications of surgical technique used in group B patients included increased use of single cross-clamp technique, increased venting of the left ventricle, and application of transesophageal and epiaortic ultrasound scanning to locate and avoid trauma to aortic atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neurobehavioral changes after coronary artery bypass grafting are common and associated with cerebral microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical technical maneuvers designed to reduce emboli production may improve neurobehavioral outcome </plain></SENT>
