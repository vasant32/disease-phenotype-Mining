<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to elucidate the possible therapeutic effects of naftidrofuryl on energy metabolism of brain regions impaired for extended periods by microsphere embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine hundred microspheres (48 microns in diameter) were injected into the right internal carotid artery of rats, and changes in their behavior and energy metabolism of the cortex, striatum and hippocampus of both hemispheres were determined with and without naftidrofuryl treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microsphere embolism induced increases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> contents and decreases in ATP and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphate of these brain regions of the right hemisphere for up to 28 days after the operation, suggesting long-lasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> or sustained damage to energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes were gradually reversed with time after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microsphere-injected rats were treated twice a day with 15 mg/kg naftidrofuryl, and their behavioral and metabolic protection were determined on the 3rd, 5th and 28th days after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of embolized animals with naftidrofuryl improved these variables appreciably on the 3rd and 28th days, but little on the 5th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The improvement on the 3rd day was more evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain regions monitored than that on the 28th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that naftidrofuryl exerts beneficial effects on the energy metabolism of brains damaged by microsphere embolism, the mechanism of which may be due to protection against the development of embolism-induced derangement </plain></SENT>
