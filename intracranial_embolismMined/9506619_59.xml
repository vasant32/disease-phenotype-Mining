<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To avoid discrediting this promising and exciting new technique, experts in this field met in January 1997 in Frankfurt, Germany, to discuss the limitations and problems of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection and to determine guidelines for its proper use in clinical practice, as well as in scientific investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, the authors suggest that studies report the following parameters: (1) ultrasound device, (2) transducer type and size, (3) insonated artery, (4) insonation depth, (5) algorithms for signal intensity measurement, (6) scale settings, (7) detection threshold, (8) axial extension of sample volume, (9) fast Fourier transform (FFT) size (number of points used), (10) FFT length (time), (11) FFT overlap, (12) transmitted ultrasound frequency, (13) high-pass filter settings, and (14) recording time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was agreement that no current system of automatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection has the required sensitivity and specificity for clinical use </plain></SENT>
