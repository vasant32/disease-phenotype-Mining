<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral embolic injury arises intraoperatively from air in the cardiac chambers and monitoring lines, particularly those in the left atrium </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Poor cannula selection or placement during bypass can cause maldistribution of the perfusate and cerebral injury </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of prospective and retrospective studies of neurological and developmental outcome after paediatric cardiac surgery at the Children's Hospital, Boston, have led to the following inferences: the use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> should be minimised; the pH stat strategy is preferred for cardiopulmonary bypass over the alpha stat strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A higher haematocrit on bypass, for example 30%, may be preferable to 20%; postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> should be strenuously avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgeons should be aware that cardiopulmonary bypass parameters can have subtle but important effects on late developmental outcome </plain></SENT>
