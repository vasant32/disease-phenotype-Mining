<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EEG was most sensitive (67%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was next (53%), and CT was least sensitive (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> detected an abnormality in five patients (8%) in whom CT was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EEG was positive in each of these patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and CT detected focal abnormalities in seven patients (12%) who had negative EEGs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the 26 patients who underwent surgery had positive CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>; 14 of these patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
