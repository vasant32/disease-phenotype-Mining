<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed such measurements before, during and till 4 weeks after photochemical induction of a cerebrocortical infarction in three rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose bengal</z:chebi>--a photosensitive dye which sticks to endothelial cells and gives rise to endothelial damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> when illuminated--was injected intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After injection, a circular area (diameter 3 mm) of the brain cortex was illuminated using an optic fiber conducting light from a <z:chebi fb="62" ids="24473">halogen</z:chebi> lamp, whether or not filtered by heat and colour filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to enable pO2 measurement in and near the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone, we constructed a transparent plastic frame in which pO2 electrodes were fixed beneath and 1 mm besides a shaft permitting mounting of the optic fiber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A black adhesive ring (inner diameter 3 mm) was attached to the bottom of the frame providing a perfectly demarcated illumination area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After fixation the electrodes were calibrated and the frame was implanted in the rabbit's skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten days later an infarction was induced; pO2 was monitored continuously before, during and till 4 hours after this induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, pO2 was recorded 24 hours, 48 hours, 5 days, 14 days and 4 weeks after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Parameters describing the time course of pO2 were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the illuminated area pO2 decreased after a certain latency time to reach a very low level, probably zero level, where it remained for at least 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gradually, recovery was observed during the following days, and four weeks after infarction both level and pattern of electrode current appeared to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the border zone pO2 decreased but did not reach zero level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recovery was observed earlier than in the illuminated area </plain></SENT>
