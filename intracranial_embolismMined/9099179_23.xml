<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The value of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) depends on the safety of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) was used to evaluate the possibilities of hypoperfusion, hyperperfusion, and embolization as causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to evaluate the significance of Doppler microembolic signals (DMES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five hundred CEAs were monitored with TCD of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery during various phases of CEA to determine hemodynamic changes and incidence of DMES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complications were graded according to their severity, and their probable cause was determined from TCD criteria and review of hospital charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed 24 cerebrovascular complications (4.8%), including 9 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and 15 (3%) with permanent deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebrovascular complications, embolism was judged to be responsible in 13 (54%; P &lt; .02 compared with hypoperfusion), hyperperfusion in 7 (29%; P &lt; .14 compared with hypoperfusion), and hypoperfusion in 4 (17%; P &lt; .08 compared with embolism plus hyperperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgeons responded to TCD information by several strategies depending on the TCD information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of permanent deficits diminished from 7% in the first 100 operations to 2% in the last 400 (P &lt; or = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Shunting was more strongly associated with cerebrovascular complications than nonshunting, but this difference was not significant (P = .24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative prevalence of DMES was strongly associated with cerebrovascular complications (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Embolism is the principal cause of cerebrovascular complications from CEA; hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion are also important causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TCD provides information that allows prompt identification and treatment of these three major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from this operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate can be reduced by appropriate measures, taken by the surgeons, based on findings of TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
