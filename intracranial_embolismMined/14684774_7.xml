<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring for asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> is currently limited to short recordings by equipment size, restricting its clinical usefulness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed a first ambulatory TCD system, evaluated it in at-risk patient groups, and used it to study the pattern of embolization in patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The system comprises an 18x11.5x3.2 cm battery-powered Doppler unit (425 g) and a 13-mm servo-controlled 2 MHz transducer probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The quadrature raw Doppler signal is stored on flash-disk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An autosearch algorithm restores vessel insonation should signal quality fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial evaluation was in 20 ambulatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 12 recently symptomatic carotid patients had recordings for &gt; or =5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recordings were well tolerated and a median of 96% of Doppler signal was suitable for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals were detected in 11 of the 12 symptomatic carotid patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was marked temporal variability in embolization and prolonging the recording increased the yield of embolic signal positive patients from 58% at 30 minutes to 92% at 150 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 3 subjects with frequent embolic signals, significant temporal clustering of embolic signals was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have developed the first ambulatory TCD system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Good-quality recordings of &gt; or =5 hours can be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In view of the demonstrated temporal variability in embolization, this technique is likely to improve the predictive value of recording for asymptomatic embolic signals and may be particularly useful in patients in whom embolic signals are relatively infrequent, such as those with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
