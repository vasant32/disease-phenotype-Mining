<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The detection of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> at the left atrial appendage (LAA) is an important step for management in a patient with a suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (SEC), which can mimic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, can confuse clinicians in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined electrocardiographic-gated 64-slice multidetector computed tomography with a 2-phase scan and transesophageal echocardiography in 314 patients with suspected embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transesophageal echocardiographic findings were classified using a 5-grade scale and the multidetector computed tomographic findings were categorized as no filling defect, an early filling defect (a filling defect seen on early-phase images without considering the late-phase images), and a persistent filling defect (a filling defect seen on added late-phase images, as well as on early-phase images) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For quantitative analysis, the ratio of Hounsfield units in the LAA to the ascending aorta (AA) was calculated for each early-phase and late-phase image (LAA/AA(L)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using transesophageal echocardiography as the reference standard, for no filling defect seen on early-phase images, the presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, including severe SEC, could be ruled out with 100% sensitivity and a 100% negative predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When considering the addition of late-phase images, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persistent filling defects had resulted from the presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and severe SEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, using the optimal cutoff value of 0.5 for the LAA/AA(L) ratio, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> could be distinguished from severe SEC where <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> had a LAA/AA(L) ratio &lt; 0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings suggest that 2-phase multidector computed tomography is useful for the detection and differentiation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> from SEC at the LAA in patients with suspected embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
