<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of early and long-term clinical outcomes and brain-imaging findings may provide insight into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prognosis, etiology, and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five thousand nine hundred seventy-one cardiac surgery patients were prospectively studied for clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and nonstroke patients were compared by early outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients included brain imaging results, long-term functional status, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome predictors were then determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 214 (3.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain imaging demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction in 72%; embolic in 83%, and watershed in 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients was 67% at 1 year and 47% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of survival were cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> type, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> elevation, cardiopulmonary bypass time, preoperative intensive care days, postoperative awakening time, and postoperative intensive care days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term disability was moderate to severe in 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> after cardiac surgery has profound repercussions that are independently related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> type and clinical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data are essential for clinical decision making and prognosis determination </plain></SENT>
