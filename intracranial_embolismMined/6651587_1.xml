<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this group two subgroups were further differentiated, subgroup IVa, including three calves surviving 31, 35, and 75 days, and subgroup IVb, with five calves surviving 104, 142, 150, and 155 days and one calf still surviving greater than 160 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean survival in the fourth group was greater than 106.5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The artificial ventricles used were the TNS-BRNO-II made of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53205">polymethylmethacrylate</z:chebi> (seven calves) and the TNS-BRNO-III, made of segmented polyetherurethane (one calf) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The controller and driving units were of our own design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Chirasist-TN-3 and TN-4 worked without trouble over the total duration of the studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> calves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation of suction was used in three of these calves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> calves survived in good physiological condition; however, some common changes were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them, such as a gradual central venous pressure increase and liver enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> calves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were technical in three cases and biological in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gains</z:mp> were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the majority of these calves, with slight individual differences observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diaphragm mineralization of various degrees was observed in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In one of them it was directly related to the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results are very encouraging for further development of the total artificial heart research in our center </plain></SENT>
