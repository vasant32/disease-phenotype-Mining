<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Electrical cardioversion (ECV) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is known to be associated with an increased peri-procedural risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ECV of AF for at least 3 weeks of effective oral anticoagulation was recently determined to be disassociated with occurrence of cerebral circulating microemboli (ME) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, whether ECV in patients undergoing short-term anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is concomitant with cerebral ME still remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether or not short-term anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> helps avoid microemboli before and immediately after cardioversion of AF in patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided ECV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 34 patients (21 women, aged 61+/-12 years) who underwent TEE-guided ECV were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for 3 days for anticoagulation before ECV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) of the right middle cerebral artery and left middle cerebral artery was simultaneously performed through the temporal skull with a two-channel 2-MHz probe in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients lasting for 30 min before ECV and 30 min immediately after successive ECV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No ME were detected in 34 patients during the 30-min period during AF before ECV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, after ECV no ME were observed during 30-min monitoring in 27 patients who were converted to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients presented with clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of manifest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> either before or after ECV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TCD monitoring did not disclose any evidence of microemboli in short-term anticoagulated patients with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> before and immediately after TEE-guided ECV </plain></SENT>
