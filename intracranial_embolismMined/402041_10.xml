<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The anthropomorphic similarity in angio-<z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the carotid system of monkeys and the use of silastic spheres, as artificial emboli, of the critical diameter of 1.2 to 1.4 mm resulted in the overall success rate of 87% in localizing the site of embolization to the ICA bifurcation, producing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the whole middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the animals with ICA-bifurcation embolization had contralateral deep motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and conjugate eye deviation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> toward the site of embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous EEG recording showed flattening of the basic background activities over the affected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> area and cerebral arteriograms showed definite retrograde filling of the proximally occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical recovery was observed in a few animals within two to five hours of embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gross ischemic swelling in the affected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, particularly in the gray matter, became obvious in six of eight animals which were exposed to four to five hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The angio-anatomical study of the carotid system of this experimental animal as a background for this <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model confirmed the previous observations of other investigators that the extremely abundant leptomeningeal anastomoses would be one of the major factors leading to the variability in the clinicopathological pictures seen in the models of proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the pre-parenchymal anastomoses in the base of brain between the medial striate arteries from the proximal anterior cerebral (ACA) and lateral lenticulostriate arteries from the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were observed and described as a possible functional collateral to the basal ganglia in case of proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
