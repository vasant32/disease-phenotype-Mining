<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with nonthrombotic ischemic cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> showed a considerable decrease in the total lumen of the cerebrovascular bed on the side of the ischemic focus with a significant increase in the coefficient of hemispherical asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most cases impoverishment of the hemodynamics was related not to occlusive or gross stenosing process of one of the major vessels but rather to nonmanifest narrowing of several vessels in the hemisphere on the involved side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The coefficient of asymmetry in patients with thrombotic cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was the minimal which is explained by the fact that even complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of one vessel has no serious effect on the total lumen of the vascular bed of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings obtained confirm the theory of the involvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> in the genesis of ischemic cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> as the main pathogenic component in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disorders of the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
