<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of two prospective studies of argatroban therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Hospitalized care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients were 960 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (767 argatroban-treated patients, 193 historical controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Argatroban 2 microg x kg x min, adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin times 1.5-3 times baseline MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Case records were reviewed to identify patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> present at or within 37 days of study entry and to assess 37-day outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 30 (3.1%) patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at entry, n = 9; new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during follow-up, n = 24; more than one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By logistic regression with treatment, protocol, age, and gender as covariates, females were significantly more likely to suffer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-5.53; p =.026) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-associated mortality (odds ratio, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.12-15.01; p =.033), and argatroban-treated patients had significantly reduced odds, vs. control, of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.96; p =.041) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-associated mortality (odds ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.92; p =.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 3.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.73-7.73; p &lt;.001) and age (odds ratio per year, 1.017; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-1.029; p =.008) were significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the argatroban group, baseline platelet counts were significantly less in patients with, vs. without, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (medians, 42 x 10/L vs. 72 x 10/L; p =.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 35 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events, 33 (94%) were ischemic and two (6%) were hemorrhagic (one per group, none during argatroban infusion); 30 (86%) were present at or within 13 days of entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, is common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and significantly increases mortality risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> occurs most often in females, in patients with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and within 2 wks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Argatroban therapy vs. control significantly reduces the likelihood of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-associated mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> without increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
