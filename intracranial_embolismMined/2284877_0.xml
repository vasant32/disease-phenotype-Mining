<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 3 mm metallic particle, which had blasted during grinding operation, shot into the neck of a nine year old boy, penetrated into the common carotid artery and embolized the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There had been no neurological symptoms until four days after the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Suddenly, a mild left side <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> occurred with accentuation of the arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The case illustrates an unusual penetration and intravascular migration of a foreign body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the injury, penetration and subsequent peripheric embolisation can happen immediately, or as in our case within a short time after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, the small particle may not be detected by a local radiogram, or may not be found on surgical exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of neck wounds caused by low velocity injection of foreign bodies, radiological evaluation with skull-x-rays and a neurological examination should be done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If further special scans are required, these should be accomplished by axial computer tomography, because the metallic nature of the foreign bodies would prohibit the examination by magnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
