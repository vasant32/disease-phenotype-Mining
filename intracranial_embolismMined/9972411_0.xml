<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transseptal mitral valvotomy (PTMV) has been established as an alternative to surgery in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To review our experience in the first 200 attempted PTMV procedures in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo>, and the short and medium term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PTMV was attempted on 200 occasions in 189 patients with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> between May 1988 and May 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 156 females and 33 males, mean age 53.5 years (range 14 to 83 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients were pregnant at the time of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Valve split was achieved at the initial attempt in 183/189 procedures (97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement of at least one New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class was achieved in 172/189 patients (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean mitral valve gradient (mean +/- SD) decreased from 11.5 +/- 5.1 mmHg to 4.9 +/- 4.1 mmHg, mean cardiac output rose from 3.9 +/- 1.1 L/minute to 4.4 +/- 1.4 L/minute and mean calculated mitral valve area increased from 1.0 +/- 0.3 cm2 to 2.1 +/- 0.9 cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients developed clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral incompetence</z:hpo> requiring surgical mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were two transient cerebral embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> were detected echocardiographically in 42 patients, but none has been a clinical problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; there were 11 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, four of which were non-cardiac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients have had repeat PTMV for re-stenosis, four to 67 months after the first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PTMV provides significant haemodynamic and clinical improvement with low risk and should be considered the treatment of choice in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
