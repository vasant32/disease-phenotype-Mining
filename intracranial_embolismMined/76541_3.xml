<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical usefulness of non-<z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> responses induced by intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) was studied in 46 patients whose evaluation included both electroencephalography (EEG) and computerized cranial tomography (CT scan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patterns of photic responses were identified and related to background EEG activity and type of lesion seen on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An asymmetry in photic driving manifested only by a consistent amplitude difference greater than 50% was rarely associated with other EEG changes such as focal slowing or significant asymmetry in the alpha rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an asymmetry in development of the photic response correlated well with ipsilateral focal slowing and CT scan evidence of parenchymatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral, symmetrical high amplitude single spikes evoked by individual light flashes were seen only in patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In no patient with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> as judged by CT scan was an abnormality in IPS the only EEG finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also no apparent relationship between the anatomical site of a focal cerebral lesion and the type of response induced by IPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Photic stimulation is of limited value in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Little clinical significance can be attached to nonconculsive responses in the absence of associated EEG changes which by themselves are generally more informative </plain></SENT>
