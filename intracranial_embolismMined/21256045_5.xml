<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cerebral embolization during trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has not been assessed clearly in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we compared the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in transfemoral (TF) and trans-apical (TA) approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Eighty patients benefited from TAVI between January 2008 and June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of these, 35 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one were TF (group 1) and 14 TA (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the same period, 285 patients benefited from a conventional aortic valve surgery (aortic valve replacement (AVR)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of these were also analyzed and considered as the control group (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We systematically performed a DWI the day before the procedure and 48 h after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DWI studies were blindly analyzed by a neuroradiologist, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had a clinical neurological assessment before and after the procedure, according the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two patients in the TAVI group had new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e>: 19 in the TF group and 13 in the trans-apical group (p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean number of embolic lesions per patient was 6.6 in group I and 6.0 in group II (p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean volume of embolic lesions was 475.0 mm³ in group I and 2170.5 mm³ in group II (p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In group III, one patient had one new cerebral lesion (p&lt;0.05 vs TAVI) of 36.5 mm³ (p=NS vs TAVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were neurologically asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of silent cerebral embolic lesions after TAVI is significantly higher compared with the standard surgical AVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The number of emboli is similar in the TF and TA groups but the volume tended to be higher in the TA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, there is no clinical impact of those lesions </plain></SENT>
