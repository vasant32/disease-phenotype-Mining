<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet agents presently used in the secondary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> fail to prevent the majority of cases of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and systemic embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An evaluation of the efficacy of new agents is hampered by a lack of in vivo models in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic cerebral embolic signals (ES) may be detected with the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These signals are particularly common after carotid endarterectomy, and this provides a situation in which new antiplatelet agents can be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this model, we determined the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">S-nitrosoglutathione</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi>), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi> with relative platelet specificity, in reducing cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS and RESULTS: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound recordings from the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery were made after carotid endarterectomy in 12 control patients and 12 patients receiving intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> from the induction of anesthesia until 2 hours after skin closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recording times were 0.5 to 3.5, 6 to 7, and 24 to 25 hours after skin closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Doppler signal was recorded onto tape, and analysis for ES was performed, with the investigators blinded to treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received aspirin 300 mg/d before surgery and 5000 IU of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median (range) number of ES detected during the initial 3-hour postoperative recording was markedly reduced in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> group compared with the control group: 7.5 (0 to 61) versus 38.5 (1 to 219) (P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This difference persisted until 6 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the administration of aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, frequent embolization occurred and was markedly reduced after the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates the potential use of platelet-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donors</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> may allow determination of the effectiveness of new antiplatelet agents in humans </plain></SENT>
