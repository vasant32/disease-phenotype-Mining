<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to detect cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography in patients with Chagas' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and to determine the relationship of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> with left ventricular systolic function and with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic events</z:hpo> are a serious complication of Chagas' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because most data come from autopsy studies, the prevalence of cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> for patients who are clinically stable is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 75 patients (52 men; mean age 48 +/- 13 years) with Chagas' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were prospectively studied by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography and followed for 24 +/- 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 14 patients (19%) had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the time of enrollment and two had this complication at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients (88%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes I and II and 9 (12%) were in classes III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean ejection fraction was 40 +/- 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 patients (23%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0587044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular thrombus</z:e> on transthoracic echocardiography and this finding was associated with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ( P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occurred in 35 patients (47%) and it was associated both with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ( P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> were more frequent ( P = .04) among patients with mild systolic dysfunction (57% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were in NYHA I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients (5%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> at the left atrial appendage, and one (1%) at the right atrial appendage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 patients (17%) died at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was frequent in Chagas' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and associated with mild systolic dysfunction and with intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These occurred mainly in the typical apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
