<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It consisted of performing six rapid sequential scans after intravenous bolus injection of iodinated contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By gamma variate fit technique, five features (corrected first moment, area, peak, time to peak, and per cent terminal height) were obtained from a time-density curve in a region of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared these features in one side of the brain with those in the corresponding contralateral side and tried to get information about cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results showed that by this technique we are able to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya moya diseases</z:e> non-invasively and know earlier and more clearly the re-establishment of circulation in the occluded arteries and of extravasation of contrast medium in ischaemic regions than by conventional CT scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, serial images of dynamic CT scanning demonstrated the anatomical details of the nidus, and the afferent and efferent vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We can also identify an exact extent of tumoral invasion of the brain in patients with malignant <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
