<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both sexes, a decrease in excess of 25% was evident in the overall age-standardized cerebrovascular disease mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, rates were roughly stable in males up to age 50 and in females up to age 45, and slightly but consistently increasing in the younger age groups (under 40), mostly in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The largest downward trends were for both sexes in the 55 to 74 age groups, and the declines were more marked in females, averaging 3% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certification is most reliable in the younger age groups and it is difficult to imagine any modification of risk factors which should affect mortality in later middle age but not in younger age groups, there is no obvious and simple interpretation of this pattern of trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A comparison with similar trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> suggests that the decline in overall cerebrovascular disease mortality might be partially or largely artefactual, though a between-sexes comparison indicates that at least part of the decrease registered in females may well be real </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of the decline, however, has been almost certainly more limited in Italy than in most other Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only in the younger age group (30-34) did rates show a larger increase in females, which might be related to increased prevalence of cigarette smoking, or the use of oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
