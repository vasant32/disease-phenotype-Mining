<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to define the clinical, echographic, and prognostic characteristics of IE in a large population of elderly patients from four European centres (three French, one Italian) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred and fifteen consecutive patients with definite IE underwent clinical evaluation, echocardiography, blood cultures, and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were separated into three groups: group A: 117 patients aged &lt;50 years, group B: 111 patients aged &gt;50 and &lt;70 years, group C: 87 patients aged &gt;70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients (group C) presented more frequently than other groups with digestive or urinary portal of entry, pacemaker <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>S bovis <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> was less frequent and S aureus <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> more frequent in younger (group A) patients than in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed among groups concerning echocardiographic data as well as the incidence and localization of embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients were operated on as frequently as younger patients and their operative risk was similar than in other groups (11%, 3%, and 5% in groups C, B, and A, respectively, P=ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality in elderly patients was low (17%) but significantly higher than in younger patients (10% in group A, 7% in group B, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, the only risk factors for in-hospital mortality were age (P=0.003), prosthetic valve (P=0.002), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, surgical management was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this largest series of elderly patients with IE, IE in elderly carries specific features when compared with younger patients, although the echographic characteristics and embolic risk are similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate in elderly patients is higher than in younger, but the mortality in operated patients is low and similar than that of younger patients </plain></SENT>
