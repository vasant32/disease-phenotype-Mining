<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microemboli occur frequently in patients with asymptomatic carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In other vascular beds, microemboli are known to initiate an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, causing organ dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we investigated whether emboli composed of cholesterol crystals, a component of human atherosclerotic plaque, could also cause <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> demonstrated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cholesterol crystals of 60 to 100 microm were injected via the rat internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was conducted after 3 days to estimate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brains were examined for matrix metalloproteinase activation at 24 hours and for albumin leakage and microglia and astrocyte activation at 4 days and 1, 2, and 4 weeks after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine changes in cognition, behavioral tests including open field, motor learning, and Barnes Maze tests were conducted on young adult and middle-aged rats 4 weeks after either a single injection or after repeated, bilateral injections given at an interval of 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Matrix metalloproteinase activation was detected in 50% of the animals examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perivascular albumin staining was found at 4 days but rarely persisted beyond 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation of microglia and astrocytes occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals and persisted for up to 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was observed in middle-aged rats after repeated, bilateral injections but not after single injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In these animals, areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were small and scattered but often involved the striatum and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cholesterol embolization</z:e> caused an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in the brain with persistent activation of microglia and astrocytes and led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> after repeated injections in middle-aged animals with only small foci of neural injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that microembolization causes <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and that minimal neuronal injury can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in older animals </plain></SENT>
