<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the performance and durability of a 23 mm vacuum formed <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi> Tricuspid Semilunar Valve, in the mitral position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The valve was implanted in eight sheep using standard cardiopulmonary bypass and intermittent aortic cross clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two early failures were due to valve tears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After modification of the manufacturing process, six further valves were implanted in six sheep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were anticoagulated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The valves were calcified on echocardiography and had increasing transvalvular gradients beginning 3 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six survived and were killed 1-2.5 years after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite gross calcification of the leaflets, medium-term function was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Careful serial sections of brain showed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both kidneys contained small calcium emboli, but no evidence of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite calcification, with good medium-term function and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, this valve may find application in temporary cardiac assist devices </plain></SENT>
