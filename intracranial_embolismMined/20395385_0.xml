<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In centers performing endovascular treatment for patients with AIS, there is variability in placing patients under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonanesthetized patients might move during the procedure leading to complications and prolonging the time to revascularization due to lack of cooperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, general anesthesia can lead to a delay of the procedure, an inability to assess the patient during the procedure, and fluctuations of blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our center does not routinely either use general anesthesia or sedate patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with nonanesthetized patients undergoing emergent mechanical embolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 66 consecutive patients enrolled in the MERCI Registry at our center from June 2007 to June 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A univariate statistical analysis was performed by using the Fisher exact test for categoric variables and the Student t test for continuous variables in comparing use of general anesthesia with nonanesthetized patient demographics, procedural times, procedural complications, good outcome, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients (13.6%) were placed under general anesthesia, and 57 (86.4%) were awake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher baseline NIHSS scores and older age were statistically associated with general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference occurred between groups in the time to groin puncture or procedural times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Revascularization rates were 77% for general anesthesia patients and 70% for nonanesthetized patients (P = .331) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The nonanesthetized group had better outcomes, but we did not control these outcomes for other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complications were much more frequent in the general anesthesia patients (22%) than in the nonanesthetized patients (3.5%) (P = .0288) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Performing mechanical embolectomy in nonanesthetized patients at our institution does not prolong procedure time, decrease revascularization rates, increase complication rates, or decrease good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mechanical embolectomy in nonanesthetized patients is effective and should be considered an option in the treatment of the patient with AIS </plain></SENT>
