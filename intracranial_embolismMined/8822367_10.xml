<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a model of experimental focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we have recently reported a strong correlation between the magnitude of ischemic depolarizations in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> borderzone and the extent of histological injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assessed the neurobehavioral consequences of spontaneously occurring and induced ischemic depolarizations in rats following middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, as well as the effects of induced spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (SD) in intact animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized, artificially ventilated Sprague-Dawley rats underwent photothrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion coupled with ipsilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The electroencephalogram and direct current (DC) potential were recorded in the parietal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> borderzone-corresponding to the cortical forelimb area-for 3 h following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1 rats (n = 9) received <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/CCA occlusion, and the spontaneously occurring negative DC shifts were recorded in the ischemic borderzone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Group 2 animals (n = 9), the (non-ischemic) frontal pole of the ipsilateral hemisphere was electrically stimulated in order to double the frequency of peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> DC shifts occurring over the initial 3 h postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 3 consisted of intact rats (n = 3) in which SD was repeatedly evoked in the frontal pole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four animals served as sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A battery of sensorimotor behavioral tests, consisting of beam balance, postural reflex and elicited forelimb placing, was applied in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sham controls and animals of Groups 1 and 2 were tested 24 h after surgery, and Group 3 rats were tested 2, 6 and 24 h after generation of SDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A cumulative neurobehavioral index, ranging from 0 to 144, was calculated by adding the individual test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brains were perfusion-fixed 24 h following surgery for calculation of volumes of infarction and scattered neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome at 24 h was significantly worse in Group 2 animals (spontaneous plus induced ischemic depolarizations) (neurobehavior index 43 +/- 19, mean +/- S.D.) compared to Group 1 rats, in which only spontaneous depolarizations occurred (neurobehavior index 24 +/- 19, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cumulative neurobehavioral index of Group 1 and 2 animals correlated positively with the volume of total ischemic injury (r = 0.765, P &lt; 0.001) and with the frequency of ischemic depolarizations (r = 0.474, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Correlations between severe forelimb placing deficits and severe degrees of histological injury (<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or ischemic cell change) in the corresponding primary sensorimotor cortical region FR1 were significant in these rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Group 3 rats showed severe neurobehavioral deficits at 2 and 6 h following SD stimulation (index 57 +/- 1 and 39 +/- 1, respectively) but returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 24 h (4 +/- 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is accompanied by transient neurobehavioral deterioration and that SD in the ischemic hemisphere of animals subjected to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion worsened functional outcome 24 h after surgery </plain></SENT>
