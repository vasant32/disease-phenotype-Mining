<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and hemodynamic changes during the successive stages of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) using transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 297 patients (206 men; mean age 69.9+/-8.0 years), the association of various TCD emboli and velocity variables with procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and cerebral events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline patient characteristics (age, sex, preoperative cerebral symptoms, and prior carotid endarterectomy) and their associations with procedure-related cerebral events were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A distinction was made between adverse events that occurred during CAS and those that happened within 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 36 procedure-related <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and cerebral events, 28 (78%) were encountered intraprocedurally; an additional 6 (2%) events occurred within 7 days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two (0.7%) patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1 week, the combined minor and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 3.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse outcome was associated with &gt;4 showers of microemboli at postdilation (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 7.8, p=0.03), particulate macroemboli (OR 9.1, 95% CI 5.1 to 16.1, p&lt;0.001), massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> from ruptured balloons (OR 11.3, 95% CI 7.6 to 16.6, p&lt;0.001), and angioplasty-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> plus <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood flow reduction (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 8.3, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patient characteristics, male gender (OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.4 to 75.8, p=0.02) and preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 6.6, p=0.003) were also related to outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In CAS, TCD monitoring provides insight into the pathogenesis of procedure-related cerebral events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microemboli during poststent dilation, particulate macroembolism, massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>, and angioplasty-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> are associated with adverse outcome, as are male gender and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
