<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> at the time of diagnosis in children with metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> (RMS) arising outside the head and neck region is unknown, and routine imaging to identify metastatic brain involvement is costly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the results of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the head, which was mandated by protocol, in patients with metastatic RMS arising outside the head and neck region who were enrolled on the fourth Intergroup <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>Rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> Study (IRS-IV; 1991--1997) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 100 eligible patients with metastatic RMS arising outside the head and neck region, 56 (56%) underwent head CT (n = 51) and/or MRI (n = 11) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven of these 56 patients (12.5%) had abnormal scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients with physical findings suggesting head or neck pathology underwent imaging that confirmed the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in bone (one patient), orbit (one patient), or lymph nodes (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> had imaging findings consistent with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of three asymptomatic patients, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone metastases</z:e> that also were identified on skeletal survey and one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone metastases</z:e> in the base of the skull that were not identified on bone scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining asymptomatic patient had a retroperitoneal paraspinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with spinal canal extension and subsequently developed leptomeningeal disease dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Brain metastases</z:e> are uncommon at the time of initial diagnosis of metastatic RMS arising outside the head and neck region, and the majority of abnormalities detected on head CT or MRI scans are evident clinically or on other imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with clinical findings suggesting intracranial pathology and those with paraspinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> may benefit from brain imaging, but cost savings may be realized by foregoing imaging in patients without these features </plain></SENT>
