<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 107 were children aged 10-18 years (mean +/- SD 14.5 +/- 2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were symptomatic New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II (n = 78) and Class III (n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following PTMC, the mitral valve area (MVA) increased from 0.73 +/- 0.18 to 1.7 +/- 0.53 cm2 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant fall in mean transmitral gradient from 15.6 +/- 5.2 to 5.1 +/- 2.3 mmHg, and in mean pulmonary artery pressure from 41 +/- 15 to 28.4 +/- 10 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiac tamponade</z:e> developed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> requiring emergency mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients (4.7%) developed moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no mortality or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in any of the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients (3.7%) had oximetry evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean mitral valve area and transmitral gradient at 14 months mean follow up was 1.68 +/- 0.4 cm2 and 6 +/- 3.5 mmHg, respectively, and were comparable to the immediate post-PTMC results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients (1.8%) developed restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The immediate haemodynamic results in children were compared to 450 adult patients who underwent PTMC in the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The outcome was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Children were found to have significantly higher pulmonary artery pressure compared to adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We found that PTMC using an Inoue balloon is very effective and safe in children, and consider that it should be the procedure of choice for young patients with symptomatic rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
