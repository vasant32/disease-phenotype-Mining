<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Two and a half million Americans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> are at an elevated risk for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> therapy is standard treatment for high-risk patients, yet 40-65% of elderly patients do not receive anticoagulation therapy due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this clinical need, we are evaluating a minimally invasive stent-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention device to divert emboli from entering the arterial supply of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The feasibility of a J-shaped <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention device was tested in a mock circulatory loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen sets of 100 simulated emboli (1-5 mm(3)) were injected into the left atrium with and without J stents protecting the aortic arch vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine efficacy, emboli were trapped in filters in the aortic arch vessels and distal aorta for manual counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: J stents decreased the number of emboli that entered the brachiocephalic trunk by 93.7% (p &lt; 0.0001), left common carotid artery by 79.8% (p &lt; 0.0001), and left subclavian artery by 89.7% (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a mock circulation, J stents positioned in the aortic arch vessels and oriented downstream of aortic flow significantly decreased the number of emboli that entered the aortic arch vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results warrant further investigation to determine the safety and efficacy of this prophylactic intervention to reduce embolic events, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> large animal studies are underway </plain></SENT>
