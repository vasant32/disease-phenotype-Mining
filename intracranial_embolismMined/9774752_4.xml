<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We determined clinical predictive factors of in-hospital embolic recurrence in presumed cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients by means of multivariate analysis based on clinical and neuroimaging prognostic variables assessed within 48 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of 347 consecutive patients with presumed cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> included in a prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics, clinical events, and outcome in the recurrent and nonrecurrent embolization group were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The independent predictive value of each variable on the development of early embolic recurrence was analyzed in two multiple liner regression models - one based on eight demographic, anamnestic, and clinical variables and another based on 10 clinical, neuroimaging, and outcome variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In-hospital recurrent embolization was diagnosed in 25 (6.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latency period was 12.1 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall in-hospital mortality was 70.8% in the recurrent embolization group and 24.4% in the nonrecurrent embolization group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">Alcohol abuse</z:e>, the combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, and previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were predictors of recurrent embolization in the model based on clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to these four variables, cardiac events were selected in the model based on clinical, neuroimaging, and outcome variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A small number of clinical features that can be easily obtained on the patient's initial assessment may help clinicians to identify a subgroup of patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the highest risk of developing early recurrent brain or systemic embolization </plain></SENT>
