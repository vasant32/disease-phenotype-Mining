<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To retrospectively assess the feasibility, safety, and clinical mid-term outcome of patients undergoing carotid artery stenting with stent-grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 4 year period stent-grafts were used in the endovascular treatment of symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in 12 patients (2 women, 10 men, aged 47-83 (mean 64) years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protection devices were not used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Possible microembolic complications were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of the brain before and the day after the procedure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 22 months (range 1-42 months), by Doppler ultrasonography and conventional angiography as well as clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The technical success rate was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 coronary stent-grafts were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean stenosis rate (in terms of diameter) was 85% and the mean length of stent-grafts used was 20.9 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter to which the stent-grafts were dilated was 4.66 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In-hospital complications occurred in 1 patient who suffered a minor femoral access <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> that did not require transfusion or surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Post-stenting diffusion-weighted MRI revealed several ipsilateral silent microemboli in only 1 case, which was completely asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after 2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Restenosis was found in 2 patients who underwent successful balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> followed by placement of a self-expandable bare stent within the stent-grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stent-grafts may prevent microembolic complications during stenting of atherosclerotic carotid lesions in selected cases, offering immediate exclusion of the atherosclerotic lesion from the circulation by pressing the plaque against the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Comparative, randomized studies in larger series of patients are needed with carotid-dedicated stent-graft designs </plain></SENT>
