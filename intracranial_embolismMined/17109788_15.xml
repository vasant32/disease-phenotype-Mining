<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both are important for selection of treatment and prediction of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study explored the diagnostic changes that lead to a delay in the correct diagnosis of paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case histories of 45 children with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (31 males, 14 females; median age 6y; age range 2mo-16y) were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial clinical diagnosis, based on the interpretation of presenting symptoms, was compared with the final aetiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> diagnosis after completion and review of diagnostic work-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The type of diagnostic change, consequent time delay until correct diagnosis, reasons for change of diagnosis, and alterations to management were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four diagnostic changes were identified; 19 in 'primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> diagnosis' (symptoms initially not attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), and five in 'aetiological diagnosis' (incorrect initial determination of type or cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median interval between initial and final diagnosis was 7 days (3h-2y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The change in diagnosis led to therapeutic alterations in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> differ from those in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is frequently not recognized as the cause of the child's symptoms, and the correct determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> aetiology takes time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend that children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> be evaluated in a centre with expertize, using standardized diagnostic protocols and careful follow-up </plain></SENT>
