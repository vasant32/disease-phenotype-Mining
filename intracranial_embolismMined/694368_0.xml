<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Available techniques include angioautomography with and without accessory device, and simultaneous angiotomography and its variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the indications, those are predominant where disturbing vascular overshadowing should be eliminated and certain details emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiotomography of the vertebrobasilar system visualizes important vascular structures without overshadowing, and hence also facilitates indirectly the assessment of certain neural structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The visualization of the contours of vascularized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is also improved, and visualization of cystic processes becomes possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contrast of discrete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staining is enhanced, and, last but not least, visualization of the vessels themselves, as well as of important details, is increased </plain></SENT>
