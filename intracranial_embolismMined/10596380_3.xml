<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study, we measured tPA antigen, PAI-1 antigen and activity, as well as tPA/PAI-1 complex in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were classified according to the TOAST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 132 consecutively screened patients, 89 (100%) were enrolled in this study, including 42 patients (47%) with large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LAA), 32 (36%) with small vessel occlusion (SVO), and 15 (17%) with cardioembolism (CE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen age-matched neurologic patients without manifestations of cerebrovascular disease served as control subjects (CS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had significantly higher plasma levels of tPA antigen (p &lt; 0.001), PAI-1 antigen (p &lt; 0.05) and PAI activity (p &lt; 0.05) than patients in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>t-PA antigen, PAI activity and tPA/PAI-1 complex levels were similar regardless of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only PAI-1 antigen was lower in patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with LAA (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma tPA antigen, PAI-1 antigen, and PAI activity are significantly increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Except for PAI-1 antigen, this increase appears not to be related to the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology </plain></SENT>
