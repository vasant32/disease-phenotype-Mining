<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> is the main cause and 30% of the ischemic events are embolic and of cardiac origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture is not always typical of the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but diagnosis of the mechanism of the event determines treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a sensitive procedure more appropriate for diagnosing emboli of cardiac origin than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore compared TEE and TTE in the determination of the source of emboli in 65 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> but without significant atherosclerotic changes in their carotid arteries, and compared these findings with those in 50 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>68% of the patients had potential sources of emboli according to TEE, compared to only 15% according to TTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control group only 24% had potential sources of emboli by TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings were: clots in the left atrium, severe aortic atheroma, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> with paradoxical shunt, spontaneous echocardiography contrast, vegetations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study showed that TEE is better than TTE in detecting the etiology of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid arteries, thus determining appropriate management </plain></SENT>
