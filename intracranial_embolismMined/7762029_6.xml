<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to elucidate the pathophysiological changes in striatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> metabolism after microsphere embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Microspheres (48 microns) were injected into the right internal carotid artery of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracellular levels of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and its metabolites were measured by in vivo microdialysis with the aid of high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo striatal tyrosine hydroxylation and turnover (catabolism) rate of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> were estimated on the first and third days after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These were estimated by measuring tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49168">dopa</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> content in the presence of either an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor or a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the microdialysis study, a 190-fold increase in the release of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> from the right striatum was observed 40 minutes after microsphere embolism, whereas the striatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> metabolites decreased during the first 180 minutes after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microsphere embolism decreased the striatal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> content throughout the experiment (28 days), whereas it increased tissue <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> metabolites on the first day, followed by a decline in the metabolites on the third day or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The in vivo turnover rate of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> decreased both on the first and third days, whereas the in vivo tyrosine hydroxylation decreased only on the third day after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that microsphere embolism induces severe damage to striatal dopaminergic metabolism 3 to 28 days after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> synthesis may be more resistant to the embolism-induced ischemic insults than its catabolism </plain></SENT>
