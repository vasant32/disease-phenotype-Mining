<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by sudden elevation of the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, and variable end-organ dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The illness is generally discrete, and symptoms regress as the <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>lipemia</z:mp> clears </plain></SENT>
