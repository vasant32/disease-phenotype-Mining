<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Summary: In order to predict the post-therapeutic hemorrhagic complication of interventional thrombolysis, we retrospectively examined angiographic findings and other factors in 44 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were super selectively catheterized within 5 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and received a fixed regimen of urokinase or t-PA, unless recanalization was achieved or deterioration was apparent before total infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediate post-therapeutic CT scan revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> within the basal ganglia in 10 patients (group 1) and no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the remaining 34 (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A series of angiograms during the therapy showed A-V shunt from lenticulostriate arteries to thalamostriate vein in 7 of 10 cases in group 1; no case in group 2 was accompanied by such abnormal shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prognosis after the therapy was worse in group 1 than in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other factors, such as therapeutic timing after the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or total doses of urokinase or t-PA infused, differed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that angiographic A-V shunt during therapy is a predictive sign of a high incidence of hemorrhagic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We recommend performing several angiographic controls during therapy and when A-V shunt is detected, the therapy should be discontinued to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> which leads to a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
