<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made between precise descriptions of gross pathology of 113 carotid artery atheromatous plaques (69 symptomatic, 44 asymptomatic) operated upon by thromboendarterectomy and results of ultrasound-Doppler examinations, to determine possible specific ultrasound criteria for precise anatomical lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Echographic criteria studied were: ultrasonic structure of plaques; relation of plaque to wall; existence or absence of a solution of continuity; regular or irregular nature of endoluminal border of plaque; and finally the notion of discordance between degree of stenosis as shown by Doppler (D) and ultrasound (E) imaging (E much less than D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Principal results were as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images of the regular, homogeneous highly echogenic plaques (36 cases) corresponded in 69.4% of cases to simple fibrous or calcified plaques with regular endoluminal borders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Irregular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> plaques (31 cases) were suggestive of irregular, friable and/or ulcerated material in 64.4% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weakly echogenic plaques (9 cases) suggested mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (44.4%) or soft, friable plaques (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plaques with solution of continuity do not correspond to a precise lesion but, in contrast, are specific (with weakly echogenic plaques) of the emboligenic character of the plaques (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The criterion ultrasound "Doppler was specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in 75% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> can also demonstrate very different ultrasound images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, in this study ultrasound-Doppler findings produced 3 false negatives (2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combined ultrasound-Doppler imaging allows quantitative evaluation and particularly qualitative assessment of carotid artery atheromatous lesions, with sufficiently reliable criteria to detect lesions of high emboligenic potential </plain></SENT>
