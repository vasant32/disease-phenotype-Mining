<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical techniques to correct the kink usually employ carotid cross-clamping and kink resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In selected cases the authors used simple kink straightening and fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients treated by this method were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Total of 42 operations in 40 patients were performed from 1984 through 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 56 years, male:female ratio 1:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients presented with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> (n=26), minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=13) or were asymptomatic (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 2 distinct groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group I. were the patients with kinking only (n=28), Group II. the patients in whom the kink was seen at the end of regular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the kink was dissected free, straightened and fixed by several stitches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the Group II. this manoeuvre followed standard carotid micro-endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Mean follow-up is 4,8 years (1-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no morbidity, no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient suffered several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in the 6 months period after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients are alive and symptom free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: In lesser kinks the simple surgical technique without cross-clamping is effective, easy and complication free </plain></SENT>
