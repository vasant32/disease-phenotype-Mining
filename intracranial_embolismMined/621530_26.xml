<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The F response occurs rarely and in groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> motor neurones did not produce any F response within an arbitrarily chosen time interval of 200 successive stimuli at 1 and 2 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spastic patients had as many silent neurones as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects but the responding neurones more frequently produced F responses (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When a neurone has few responses at rest the frequency increases under activation of the contralateral or ipsilateral muscle (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When there are many responses in the relaxed state there is a decrease (P less than 0.001) under activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The behaviour of an individual neurone is consistent in different activation periods </plain></SENT>
