<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Recent studies have shown that the use of thrombolysis in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to initiation of medication and the dose levels of the thrombolytic agents are important determinants for the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated the time course of thrombolysis-related <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> in experimental settings and tested whether the addition of neuroprotective medication augments the efficacy of thrombolysis and reduces the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to right middle cerebral artery embolization with an autologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and were then randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Group 1, saline-treated (2 hours after ischemic insult) animals as controls; Groups 2 to 4, high-dose urokinase (5,000 U/kg) at 2, 3, and 6 hours after the insult; Group 5, low-dose urokinase (2,500 U/kg) at 2 hours after the insult; Group 6, 20 mg/kg topiramate (TPM) at 2 hours after the insult; Group 7, a combination of 20 mg/kg TPM at 2 hours and low-dose urokinase (2,500 U/kg) at 6 hours after the insult; and Group 8, 20 mg/kg TPM (20 mg/kg) at 2 hours and high-dose urokinase (5,000 U/kg) at 2 hours after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological behavior and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the brain were assessed following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and the various treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals in the single therapy and low-dose combination groups survived surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of eight animals treated with high-dose urokinase alone at 6 hours and three of six animals in the combined high-dose urokinase and TPM group developed fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly better neurological outcome at 24 hours in the animals treated with either medication compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The volume of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the saline-treated group was 54.2 +/- 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of TPM at 2 hours led to a decrease in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to 20.1 +/- 11.2% (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with urokinase at 6 hours after the occlusion showed a trend toward protection; the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 31.9 +/- 14.1% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The addition of TPM to low- or high-dose urokinase achieved better neuroprotection (8.2 +/- 6% and 11.9 +/- 10.7%, respectively; both p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study the authors show that the volume of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> can be significantly decreased with 2 to 6-hour delayed intraarterial thrombolysis with urokinase and that the efficacy of thrombolysis may be enhanced by combining neuroprotective agents like TPM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is also shown that low-dose combination therapy may decrease the likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
