<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral air emboli (CAE) are thought to contribute to adverse cerebral outcomes following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the effect of escalating volumes of CAE on survival and neurologic and histologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> administration during CAE on these outcomes was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With institutional review board approval, four groups were studied (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two CPB-CAE groups, rats were subjected to 90 min CPB with 10 repetitively administered CAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats in two sham-CAE groups were also exposed to CAE but not to CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly assigned to sequential dose cohorts receiving CAE ranging from 0.2 to 10 microl in a dose-escalating fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Groups were further subdivided into <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> (56%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51144">nitrogen groups</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rats with severe neurologic damage were killed; others were neurologically tested until postoperative day 7, when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival and neurologic and histologic outcomes were tested with logistic regression analyses (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study demonstrates a dose-dependent relation between CAE volumes and survival, neurologic outcome, and histologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outcomes, CPB adversely affected the dose-effect curves compared with sham-CAE groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi> demonstrated no impact on either outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the successful incorporation of CAE in a rodent CPB model and allows identifying suitable CAE volumes for subsequent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CAE exhibit a differential effect on outcome in rats undergoing CPB versus those not exposed to CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Perioperative administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> remained without any effect on outcome </plain></SENT>
