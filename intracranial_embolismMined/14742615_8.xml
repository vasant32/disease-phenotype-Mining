<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been uncertainty as to whether a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right to left shunt</z:hpo> through an isolated pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (P-AVF) without Rendu-Osler-Weber (ROW) disease can cause paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A population of 747 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients was examined to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of those patients who had an isolated P-AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of a P-AVF was determined as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined cause, both transoesophageal echocardiography and transcranial Doppler with saline contrast medium was performed to detect a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right to left shunt</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If a P-AVF was then suspected, selective pulmonary angiography and enhanced chest CT was performed to confirm the presence of the P-AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients (0.5%) were diagnosed as having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with an isolated P-AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were middle-aged women (mean age 61 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients, the P-AVF could not have been suspected on physical findings or chest x ray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The P-AVF was always single and located in the lower lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and three patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complex were elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, this indicated an activation of both fibrinolytic and thrombin activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results show that an isolated P-AVF without ROW disease can cause paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the existence of an isolated P-AVF as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right to left shunt</z:hpo> in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of unknown origin should not be overlooked, even if a P-AVF is not suggested by the initial physical findings or chest x ray </plain></SENT>
