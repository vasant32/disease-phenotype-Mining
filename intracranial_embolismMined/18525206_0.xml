<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aims of our study were to elucidate the differences in the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarctions involving the striatocapsular region and to compare those following embolic striatocapsular infarctions with those originating from <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease (MCAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> located in the lenticulostriate artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain coronal diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance angiography were carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> distribution were divided into 3 categories: (1) dominant in the distal territory (DD), (2) distributed equally between the distal and proximal territories (DE) and (3) dominant in the proximal territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms were classified into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from proximal embolism, MCAD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proximal embolic sources were significantly more prevalent in patients with a DE lesion, but symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses were more common in patients with a DD lesion than in those with a DE lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the dominant area of striatocapsular infarctions on coronal DWI can be an important clue for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology </plain></SENT>
