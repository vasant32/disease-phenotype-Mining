<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In about 30% of the cases the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is attributed to stenosis of a supraaortic vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the last few years the percutaneous angioplasty and stenting is an alternative method of the classical surgical treatment--the carotid thrombendarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crucial moment in the evolution of the method is the introduction in the practice of the systems for distal embolic protection of the brain and the routine implantation of stents with new design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the main conditions for successful and noncomplicated stenting is the respect of a strict procedural protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the article we present the results of 17 cases with angioplasty and stenting of supraaortic vessels performed in our Clinic in the period 07.02.2001-01.07.2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immediate success rate is 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No major complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the midterm follow-up there were no <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and restenosis of the implanted stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We present four interesting case reports: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One stage stenting of right coronary artery and right internal carotid artery, 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stenting of a subocclusive right internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> with balloonexpandable stent and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Stenting of a vertebral artery as the unique brain supplying vessel and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Stenting of subocclusive aortoostial lesion of the brachiocephalic trunk in a patient with totally occluded contralateral internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stenting of supraaortic vessels is a safe and reliable method when performed by experienced operator and when are applied the ultimate methods of cerebral protection and the new stent designs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The carotid stenting is a reliable alternative of the surgery and gains more and more popularity </plain></SENT>
