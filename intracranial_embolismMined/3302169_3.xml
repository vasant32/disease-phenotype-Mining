<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first patient was implanted for 12 hours with the pneumatic Phoenix total artificial heart after failure of a donor heart 1 day after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following retransplantation the patient died from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001708'>right ventricular failure</z:hpo>, and Pseudomonas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second patient was implanted with the Jarvik-7 total artificial heart for rapidly deteriorating idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major complications during the 9 1/2-day implant consisted of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> for the first 4 days and a multifocal cerebral embolic event on the seventh day after implantation from which he fully recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major problems after transplant included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343816" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disseminated toxoplasmosis</z:e> and two mild episodes of rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged 68 days after surgery and remains well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third patient was a 40-year-old woman with rapidly progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> A <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy, cardiogenic shock with multiple organ failure developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 70 ml Jarvik-7 was implanted for 4 1/2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> humoral rejection from autoantibodies and alloantibodies led to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> on the second day after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A second 70 ml Jarvik-7 implant was followed by severe multisystem and infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After prolonged intensive care support, the patient recovered and is now awaiting transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nearly 100% cytotoxic antibody reactivity caused by multiple antigenic stimuli is preventing ready access to donor hearts for this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We view the current role of the total artificial heart as a tool to preserve life until a suitable donor heart can be found, reverse the end-organ effects of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and low output, and restore transplant candidacy in selected patients with temporary reversible contraindications to transplantation </plain></SENT>
