<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Specimens from 1376 patients with thrombotic events or their relatives were tested for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> by polymerase chain reaction plus restriction digest from Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1, 1995, to Mar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>31, 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C (APC) resistance test data was available for 554 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical information was available for 166 patients with the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1376 patients tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, 270 (19.6%) were positive, with 12 homozygotes and 258 heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 554 patients for whom APC resistance data was available, 221 (39.9%) had low APC resistance ratios (&lt; or = 2.4); of these only 97 (43.9%) were factor V Leiden-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 333 samples with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or elevated APC resistance ratios, 19 (5.7%) were later identified with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, despite the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> screening test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred fourteen of 166 patients (68.7%) with the mutation had at least one thrombotic event, most commonly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Arterial cerebrovascular thrombotic events occurred in 11 patients (10%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> in eight (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with arterial thrombotic events was 45.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The factor V mutation is a common cause of venous thromboses but may also be associated with the early presentation of arterial thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The APC resistance test is a sensitive screening assay but has limitations of its specificity in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
