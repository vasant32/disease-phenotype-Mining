<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reperfusibility of the corresponding capillary bed was unimpaired for the initial six hours after occluding the vessel, as demonstrated by in vivo intravenous injection of carbon black </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Short-term occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, followed by re-opening of the vessel, resulted in either (a) no demonstrable parenchymal lesions (i.e., areas of softening), (b) smaller lesions, or (c) infarctions that were either hemorrhagic or confined to the subcortical white matter of the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
