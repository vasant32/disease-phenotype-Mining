<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: This pilot study assessed the safety and efficacy of left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion, performed at the time of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: At the time of CABG, 77 patients with risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were randomized to LAA occlusion or control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LAA was occluded using sutures or a stapling device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Completeness of occlusion was assessed with transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in cardiopulmonary bypass duration, perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During surgery, there were 9 appendage tears, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were repaired easily with sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients having a postoperative transesophageal echocardiography, complete occlusion of the LAA was achieved in 45% (5/11) of cases using sutures and in 72% (24/33) using a stapler, P = .14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of LAA occlusion by individual surgeons increased from 43% (9/21) to 87% (20/23) after performing 4 cases (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 13 +/- 7 months, 2.6% of patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LAA occlusion at the time of CABG is safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of complete occlusion improves, to acceptable levels, with increased experience and the use of a stapling device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A large trial is needed to determine if LAA occlusion prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
