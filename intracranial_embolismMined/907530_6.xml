<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The scans were traced on anatomical templates without knowledge of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A phasics were classified by their test scores according to taxonomic criteria, independently from localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scans belonging to each clinically distinct group were overlapped "blindly" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed distinct areas for Broca's conduction and Wernicke's aphasics along the parasylvian axis of the lateral templates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions of global aphasics covered <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these areas, while transcorticals were outside of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesion size and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> showed significant correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that a brief systematic survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> like ours is useful in predicting the anteroposterior location and often the depth and extent of lesions </plain></SENT>
