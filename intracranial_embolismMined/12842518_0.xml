<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the midterm results of transaortic stent-grafting for distal aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and the feasibility of this method for thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients with true distal aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or proximal descending thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> were repaired with the stent-graft introduced through the incision on the proximal arch aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up computed tomography was performed every 6 months in 21 surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maximum dimension of the excluded aneurysmal space and the maximum aneurysmal diameter were measured and evaluated to determine whether the aneurysmal space decreased or disappeared after this alternative procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was 1 hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (4.3%) due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> 1 year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (91%) survived during the follow-up period, but 1 patient (4.3%) suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 62 months (average, 34.3 +/- 15.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no instances of aneurysmal rupture during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative serial computed tomography scans showed disappearance or significant shrinkage of the excluded aneurysmal space in 20 of 21 patients (95%), except for the one patient with endoluminal leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transaortic endovascular stent-grafting was an effective alternative approach to treating distal aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The excluded <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> disappeared or shrunk after successful placement of the stent-graft </plain></SENT>
