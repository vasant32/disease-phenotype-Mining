<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our group initiated a program of coronary angioplasty (CA) in patients with symptomatic one vessel disease, or multivascular lesions with a critical "culprit" stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a 16 month period we have performed CA of 28 lesions in 25 patients (20 men) with a mean age of 54 +/- 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> was diagnosed in 14 patients, unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> in 7, and post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> residual <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> or stenosis in 4 patients treated with streptokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was obtained in 23 (82.1%) of 28 stenotic segments, reducing the stenosis from 90 +/- 8% (range 70-100) to 9 +/- 12% (range 0-30; p less than 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases with total occlusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was not obtained, and in one case the procedure was complicated by fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 4 complications due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> or spasm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them resolved during CA without sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 20 cases with primary success have been followed during an average of 8.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three cases (15%) restenosis was detected; two of them underwent surgery, and CA was repeated successfully in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disappearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> was confirmed in 14 patients, and functional improvement in the other three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CA is an effective and relatively safe therapeutic alternative in different clinical forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> with a single vessel stenosis, or in selected cases of multivascular lesions with a critical stenosis </plain></SENT>
