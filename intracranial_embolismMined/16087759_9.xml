<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate embolic and hemodynamic transcranial Doppler monitoring findings and their relationships with the occurrence of procedural CVSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients Fifty-four patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of more than 70% underwent a total of 57 CAS procedures during transcranial Doppler monitoring of mean blood flow velocity and microembolic signals in the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the CAS procedure was considered CVSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine (15.8%) of the 57 patients had CVSs during the procedure (ie, 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, 1 with transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, 1 with a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 1 with a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean blood flow velocity median values were statistically significantly lower (P &lt; .001) in the group of 9 patients with CVSs (36 cm/s; interquartile range, 32.3-38.5) compared with the 48 without CVSs (48 cm/s; interquartile range, 41.5-52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median number of isolated microembolic signals was similar in the 2 groups (72; interquartile range, 66-81 vs 75; interquartile range, 67-83.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median number of microembolic signal showers (clusters of too many signals to be counted separately in one cardiac cycle) presented a nonsignificant prevalence in the patients with CVSs (9; interquartile range, 7.5-11.2) compared with the ones without CVSs (8.2; interquartile range, 7-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The low flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery may impair the clearance of the microembolic load and should be considered a precursor of CVSs during the CAS procedure </plain></SENT>
