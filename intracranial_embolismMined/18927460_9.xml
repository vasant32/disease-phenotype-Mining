<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their potential harmful effects on the brain are, however, unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to relate the frequency and type of per-procedural microembolic signals to procedure-related ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> and new ipsilateral ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted cerebral MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-five patients who were prospectively treated with CEA (61) or carotid angioplasty with stenting (30) for high-grade (&gt;/=70%) internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> were monitored during the procedures using multifrequency transcranial Doppler with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postprocedural cerebral diffusion-weighted cerebral MRIs were performed on a subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Solid and gaseous microemboli were independently associated with procedure-related ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> (solid: P=0.027, gaseous: P=0.037) or new ipsilateral diffusion-weighted cerebral MRI lesions (solid: P=0.043, gaseous: P=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals were detected during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures except one (CEA); 17% and 21% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> emboli were solid during carotid angioplasty with stenting and CEA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing carotid angioplasty with stenting had more solid (P&lt;0.001) and gaseous (P&lt;0.001) emboli and more new ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> (P=0.033) compared with patients undergoing CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Echolucent plaques (P=0.020) and preprocedural diffusion-weighted cerebral MRI ischemic lesions (P=0.002) were associated with increased numbers of solid emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Solid and gaseous microemboli were increased in patients with procedure-related ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> or new diffusion-weighted cerebral MRI lesions, which suggests that both solid and gaseous emboli may be harmful to the brain during CEA and carotid angioplasty with stenting </plain></SENT>
