<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Single center studies using serial cerebral diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in patients having cardiac catheterization have suggested that cerebral microembolism might be responsible for silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (SCI) as high as 15% to 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated in a multicenter trial the incidence of SCIs after cardiac catheterization and whether or not the choice of the arterial access site might impact this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were randomized to have cardiac catheterization either by Radial (n = 83) or Femoral (n = 77) arterial approaches by experimented operators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was the occurrence of new cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on serial diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient and catheterization characteristics, including duration of catheterization, were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of SCI did not differ significantly between the Femoral and Radial groups (incidence of 11.7% versus 17.5%; OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62-1.16; P = .31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At multivariable analysis, the independent predictors of SCI were the patient's higher height and lower transvalvular gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of SCI after cardiac catheterization of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> was confirmed, but its occurrence was not affected by the selection of Radial and Femoral access </plain></SENT>
