<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a group of 30 rabbits (17 of them submitted to embolization by means of microspheres introduced into the carotid and 13 used as controls), biohumoral electrical and histological parameters were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous platelet aggregation test proved significantly related to the extent of changes taking place, as measured by PDS levels and QEEG "delta" activity (respectively, P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation, in relation to the occurrence or absence of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, revealed a "sensitivity" of 80% and a "specificity" of 92.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When not only the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of but also the increase in aggregation is taken into account, the "sensitivity" figure appears to go up to 93.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endothelial damage and "cascade" platelet aggregation appeared to be a prerequisite for the occurrence of the changes found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these changes, the pathogenetic role of the regional vasospasm as opposed to mere mechanical obstruction seems to be confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that the identification of spontaneous platelet aggregation using K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Breddin's method and its quantification based on Born's turbidimetric principle, may be usefully employed to assess the risk factor constituted by an abnormal tendency to platelet hyperaggregation </plain></SENT>
