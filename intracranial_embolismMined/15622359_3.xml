<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Protruding aortic arch <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> is associated clinically with life-threatening emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Definitive treatment for aortic arch <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> removal has demanded complicated vascular surgical procedures, with high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) enabled diagnosis of a protruding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> at the aortic arch in 5 patients, and a simultaneous lesion in the descending aorta in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients had visceral emboli, coinciding with peripheral emboli in 2 patients, and the fifth patient had peripheral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and femoral emboli a few months previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean patient age was 51 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None had clinical evidence of coronary or peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atherosclerotic occlusive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n = 2), smoking (n = 4), and preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent TEE-guided aortic balloon thrombectomy from the arch with a 34-mm occluding balloon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient also underwent balloon thrombectomy from the descending aorta with a 14F Foley catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Access into the aorta was obtained through the iliac artery (n = 4) during laparotomy because of visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or through the transfemoral approach (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Previous procedures included superior mesenteric embolectomy (n = 3), segmental bowel resection (n = 1), splenectomy (n = 1), and peripheral arterial embolectomy n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Real-time intraoperative TEE enabled visualization of the protruding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and assisted with maneuvering of the balloon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At completion peripheral thrombectomy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> material was retrieved in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively there were no clinically proved new procedure-related visceral emboli, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Follow-up TEE within 2 weeks and up to 7 years revealed no recurrent aortic arch <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TEE-guided aortic balloon thrombectomy used in 6 procedures was effectively completed without visceral or peripheral ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It enabled removal of the life-threatening source of emboli from the proximal aorta, thereby averting the need of major aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
