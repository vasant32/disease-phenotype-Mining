<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors present a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (HITT) that occurred after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), and they review the relevant literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An immune-mediated syndrome, HITT is characterized by moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and paradoxical vascular thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it has been estimated in prospective studies that HITT occurs in between 1 and 3% of patients receiving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, it is underrecognized in the neurosurgical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present case, a 49-year-old woman underwent clipping of a right posterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> after suffering a Hunt and Hess Grade III SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had an uncomplicated postoperative course with good clip positioning and no vasospasm observed on a cerebral angiogram obtained on Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On Day 23, the patient developed a right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and experienced a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014549,C0494475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">grand mal</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A head computerized tomography scan revealed a hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the left middle cerebral artery distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeated cerebral angiograms did not show vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She was thrombocytopenic (platelet count as low as 46 x 10(9)/L on Day 28 compared with 213 x 10(9)/L on Day 1) and had been receiving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> flushes to maintain intravenous catheter patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An assay for HITT-associated antibodies was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> flushes were discontinued and the platelet count recovered (121 x 10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>She improved neurologically, but was left with a significant right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This patient had assay-proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> despite minimal exposure to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because there was no evidence of vasospasm or other factors to account for her delayed hemorrhagic infarction, an HITT-related disorder seemed most likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite a large body of literature describing HITT in nonneurosurgical patients, only three previous neurosurgical cases have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This case report may serve to heighten awareness of this disorder </plain></SENT>
