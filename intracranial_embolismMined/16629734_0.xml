<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lack of consistent threshold criteria between clinical trials may explain part of the discrepancy in the reported HITS counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of choosing different thresholds on the sensitivity and specificity of detecting HITS during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two observers independently analyzed TCD recordings from 8 patients under CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doppler signals were classified as true HITS, equivocal HITS, artifacts, and Doppler speckles according to preestablished criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative intensity of Doppler signals was measured by two different methods (TCD software vs manual) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receiver Operating Characteristic curves determined the optimal threshold for each of the two intensity methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reviewers achieved agreement in 96% of 2190 Doppler signals (kappa = 0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relative intensities calculated with the TCD-software method were 3 dB (95% CI: 3.0-3.4) higher than the manual method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The optimal threshold was found at 10 dB (sensitivity: 99%; specificity: 90.8%) with the software method and at 7 dB with the manual method (sensitivity: 96%; specificity: 83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of an intensity threshold 2 dB higher than the optimal increased the rejection of true HITS by 8% and 14%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using intensity thresholds higher than the optimal for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection decreases HITS counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Choosing a threshold depends on the type of method used for measuring the signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Uniform threshold criteria and comparative studies between different Doppler devices are necessary for making clinical trials more comparable </plain></SENT>
