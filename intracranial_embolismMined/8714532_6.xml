<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little research has been done to assess the reproducibility of these data and the required time for recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined one middle cerebral artery in 7 subjects with carotid, aortic or cardiac embolic source for 24 h by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis for embolic signals was done off line completely blinded to the diagnosis and the time of the day during the recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 subjects varying from 0 per h to 13 per h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals occurred throughout the day with a nonsignificant tendency towards higher values in the early morning hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Half an hour recording would not have been suitable to rule out or to confirm the presence of embolic signals as there were too many gaps between embolic signals of more than 1/2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hour is the required minimum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concerning the number of embolic signals, even a recording of four hours yielded variabilities of 0.25 and 8 embolic signals per hour in the same person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We recommend to perform follow-up studies the same time of the day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with a low number of embolic signals longer recordings or a lower detection threshold with a higher number of detected embolic signals are necessary to compare frequencies of embolic signals </plain></SENT>
