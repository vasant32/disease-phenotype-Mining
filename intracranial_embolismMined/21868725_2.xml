<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A major disadvantage of carotid artery stenting (CAS) compared to carotid endarterectomy is the increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, establishing a simple method to discriminate fragile plaques on preoperative routine examination is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined whether high-intensity signal (HIS) in the plaque on time-of-flight (TOF) MRA, performed for screening, can discriminate plaque at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the 30 patients treated using carotid endarterectomy, relationships between pathological findings of the plaques and TOF-MRA findings were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 112 patients treated using CAS, postoperative ipsilateral ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging and periprocedural ischemic symptoms were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage area of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> stained by glycophorin A was significantly larger in HIS-positive plaques (51.8%±9.8%) than in HIS-negative plaques (8.6%±9.4%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging were more frequent in the HIS-positive plaques (25/38; 65.8%) than in the HIS-negative plaques (26/74; 35.1%; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural ischemic symptoms were more frequently observed in HIS-positive plaques (7/38; 18.4%) than in HIS-negative plaques (1/74; 1.4%; P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified HIS on TOF-MRA as an independent predictor of periprocedural ischemic symptoms (odds ratio, 15.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.76-129.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HIS in the plaque on TOF-MRA performed for screening could discriminate plaques at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during CAS </plain></SENT>
