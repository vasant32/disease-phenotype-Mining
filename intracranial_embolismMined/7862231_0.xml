<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical records were reviewed to analyse occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and other risk factors that may predispose to the development of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The comparison of risk factors associated with deep, small, ischaemic lesions of the brain (revealed in 67% by CT, in 31% by MRI and in 2% by autopsy) and large superficial or superficial and deep ischaemic lesions (diagnosed in 89% by CT, 4% by MRI and 7% by autopsy) was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, treated and untreated, was more frequent in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant difference was found in large stenotic lesions of internal carotid artery, which were more common in patients with large superficial or superficial and deep lesions (watershed area) and in moderate stenotic lesions of internal carotid artery, which were more common in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggests that lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> from carotid sources </plain></SENT>
