<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is simultaneously measured with the blood flow, 3 min following the intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> (2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi>-14C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>Hypercapnia</z:mp> induces an increase in the flow but does not modify the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake and moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> results in a decrease in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake without modifying the flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In pathological conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or stricture, the blood flow and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake variations are not parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results show that the 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake does not follow the blood flow and that it depends on the cell activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible to use this method when the consumption studies cannot be implemented </plain></SENT>
