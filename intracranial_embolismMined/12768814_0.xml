<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite of sound evidence, that oral anticoagulation reduces substantially the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and concomitant risk factors, in daily practice only a part of these patients is in fact treated with anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate to which extent existing guidelines for the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> are transformed in the "real world" context of a Swiss urban network of primary care providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The greatest part (88.4%) of the included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> had a high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and herewith the indication for anticoagulation was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For a primary care collective the amount of patients with anticoagulation was high: 74.1% did receive this kind of preventive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>89% had robust International normalized ratio (INR) values within the recommended range (INR 2.5-3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common reasons not to prescribe oral anticoagulation were: old age (17.5%; mostly in combination with other reasons), risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> (16.5%), medical indication not given (16.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus the recommendations of the guidelines have been transformed into practice for a bigger part of the included patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given these results a broadly implemented quality-improvement-project to bring up the anticoagulation rate even higher hardly seems to be efficacious and is presently not of top priority in this network of primary care providers </plain></SENT>
