<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the technical feasibility and the clinical results of cerebral protection with the Angioguard emboli-capture guidewire system during carotid artery stenting (CAS) for high-grade stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 20 patients 20 stenoses of the internal carotid artery were treated with stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed before and 24 hr after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The filter device was effectively employed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> steps of the procedure in 16 of 20 patients, in two only postdilation could be protected, and in two no protection was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After three of the 20 procedures new ipsilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> were visualized by DW-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No new permanent neurologic deficits occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral protection with the filter device is technically feasible in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI demonstrated new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> indicating the occurrence of cerebral microemboli during the protected procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are necessary to determine whether the use of the cerebral protection device will improve the results of CAS </plain></SENT>
