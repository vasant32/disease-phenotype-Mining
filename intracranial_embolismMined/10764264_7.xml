<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the protective effects of various periprocedural interventions in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> as a complication of endovascular carotid sacrifice (ECS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two cases of ECS performed at our institution, between October 1987 and July 1998, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients underwent superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 21 patients, the carotid artery was occluded proximal to the target lesion; and in 11 patients, a lesion trapping procedure was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients were prophylactically anticoagulated, 14 received antiplatelet agents prophylactically, and 12 received no pharmacoprophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the six patients who were anticoagulated, there were no embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Embolic events affected 4 of 14 patients receiving prophylactic antiplatelet agents, 2 of 12 patients receiving no pharmacoprophylaxis, 1 of 11 patients who underwent a trapping procedure, and 5 of 21 patients whose carotid artery was occluded proximal to the target lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postocclusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> developed in 7 of 15 patients who underwent bypass surgery, and in 1 of the remaining 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass did not protect against postocclusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> after ECS in this series (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the small number of patients studied precludes statistical validity (P = 0.29), the trends suggest that antiplatelet agents provide no protection against postocclusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> after ECS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic anticoagulation (P = 0.32) and lesion trapping (P = 0.12) may reduce the frequency of postocclusion embolic events after ECS; however, because of the small number of patients, statistical significance could not be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
