<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of quantitative EEG (qEEG) to an animal model of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> (CAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 12 anesthetized pigs, air was injected into the internal carotid artery, and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment was started either after 3 minutes or after 60 minutes (United States Navy Treatment Table 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Off-line spectral analysis was used to determine the frequency content of the EEG signal, and factor analysis was performed to determine the frequency ranges that optimally showed the changes in the power spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis revealed two factors that represented different and independent spectral changes during embolization: 0.5 to 7.3 Hz (band 1) and 26.4 to 30.3 Hz (band 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shortly after embolization, the power in both bands decreased to a minimum, representing an isoelectric EEG in 11 out of the 12 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EEG differences between animals were considerable, despite standardized doses of injected air, and qEEG can objectively assess and quantify these differences in immediate impact of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> on brain function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, qEEG enabled monitoring of the recovery from the initial embolic event and of the response on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial recovery was much more protracted in band 2 than in band 1, but even after completing HBO treatment, qEEG values did not return to baseline values in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, two animals did not survive until the end of the HBO treatment, and qEEG proved to be superior to the other measured hemodynamic variables to detect and ensure a deterioration of brain function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study showed that qEEG monitoring has significant additional value to monitoring HBO treatment </plain></SENT>
