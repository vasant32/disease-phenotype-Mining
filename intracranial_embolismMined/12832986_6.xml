<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A review of current literature combined with personal experience in the field of carotid stenting is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endovascular stent placement for carotid artery occlusive disease is evolving from its initial controversial position to that of an alternative treatment of extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high technical success (98-99%) as well as the relatively few complications makes carotid stenting a substitute for carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic patients and especially those with high medical comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the advent of distal embolic protection, the complication rates for carotid stenting have decreased by approximately 50% to 2-4% for most major centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, with improved technology, carotid stenting is becoming an option for asymptomatic patients, especially those with high surgical risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early results for patency and neurological follow-up have also been encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When we first began performing carotid stenting in 1995, we used a mixture of peripheral and coronary techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As stent design, guide catheters and cerebral protection devices have become dedicated and sophisticated, the technical success, patency and complication rates have improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Carotid stenting will increase in application in the future especially among high surgical-risk patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
