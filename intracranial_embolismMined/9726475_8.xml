<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Recently developed interventional radiologic techniques, such as embolization with <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coils, may induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation within an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of microemboli distal to untreated and treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among a total of 110 patients treated with <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coil embolization, 35 patients (27 women and eight men, aged 50+/-10 years) who were at high risk of ischemic complications underwent emboli detection with a transcranial Doppler sonographic monitoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were studied before and after coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were located at the internal carotid artery (n=14), the basilar artery (n=10), the middle cerebral artery (n=7), or the vertebral artery (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine (85%) of 35 patients were monitored within 6 hours of the completion of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microemboli distal to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were not detected in any of the patients before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were detected in 11 patients (31%) after embolization (mean, 16+/-21 per hour; range, 1-74 per hour) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were detected in five (71%) of seven patients in whom ischemic complications occurred after treatment, but in only six (21%) of 28 asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of occurrence of emboli in patients with ischemic complications (23+/-30 emboli per hour) was higher than in asymptomatic patients (10+/-7 emboli per hour), but this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Microemboli were detected significantly more often in patients who suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> after coil embolization of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This observation supports the definition of a high-risk group of patients with incomplete embolization or with a large-diameter, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000475'>broad-neck</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The early detection of microemboli after treatment may be an indicator for excessive intraaneurysmal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and could influence the decision for prophylactic treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or aspirin </plain></SENT>
