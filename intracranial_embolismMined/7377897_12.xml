<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The local blood flow was determined using the iodoantipyrine technique in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum and remainder of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Embolization resulted in a decrease in the blood flow and a modification of the distribution of microflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides, the embolization produced changes in energy metabolism, specially a fall in ATP and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and an increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently severe vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between the number of microspheres injected and the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with an extract of Ginkgo Biloba leaves partially suppressed the effects of the embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increase in the blood flow associated with normalization of cellular energy metabolism explained the decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
