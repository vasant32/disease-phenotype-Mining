<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microemboli could abide to a certain laminae, and have a consistent velocity, or wander between different laminae, and keep changing their velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and seventy four microemboli were recorded by transcranial Doppler (TCD) in six patients with artificial valves, and 119 microemboli were recorded in response to i.v. injection of saline agitated with air in eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transit time of microemboli, calculated based on their arrival time at the cerebral vessel (site of monitoring) was explored as a possible function of their measured velocity at the detection point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> group, the relation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> velocity and transit time was: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> velocityPFO = -41.8 * transit time + 100.6, whereas for the artificial heart valve group it was: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> velocityValve = -22.6 * transit time + 67.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transit time, in both clinical groups, was inversely related to velocity (p &lt; 0.001), thus, early appearing emboli had higher velocity and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inverse relation between transit time and measured terminal velocity implies a consistent velocity per microemboli en route, in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, a flow abided to a certain laminae seems to characterize microemboli </plain></SENT>
