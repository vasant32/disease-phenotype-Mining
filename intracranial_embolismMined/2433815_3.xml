<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since perfluorocarbon emulsions such as FC-43 have greater solubilities for gases compared to plasma, it was decided to investigate their potential in providing protection against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> produced by such emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty rabbits were divided into three groups of ten, twenty, and ten </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="44932">acepromazine</z:chebi> and ketamine and were given an infusion of either hetastarch or FC-43, 10 ml/kg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Group I, which received a bolus air injection into the internal carotid artery, survival rates were: 2/5 for the hetastarch group and 5/5 for the FC-43 group (p less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, which received an air infusion until the EEG was flat bilaterally, 3/10 hetastarch-treated rabbits survived while 10/10 FC-43-treated rabbits survived for 24 hours (p = .035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group 3, analysis of blood viscosity and osmolality over a four hour period following either hetastarch or FC-43 infusion resulted in no significant differences between the two treatments but a significant decrease in both variables after 30 minutes which returned to baseline values at 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the study demonstrate a protective effect from cerebral air emboli delivered into the internal carotid artery as either a bolus or slow infusion in rabbits pretreated with a perfluorocarbon emulsion in terms of survivability and recovery from transient neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
