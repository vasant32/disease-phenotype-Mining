<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined these associations by performing a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a search of articles published from January 2000 to October 2010 using the following keywords: {(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor) or (AT1R) or (AGT1R)} and {(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) or (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>) or (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>)} </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven studies testing the association between AT1R gene A1166C polymorphisms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> risk were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analyses were performed using the Review Manger 5.0.25 software package </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combined data showed no association between the AT1R 1166 AC/CC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-1.34, p = 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analyses, the association was also not significant among the White populations (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.88-1.38, p = 0.39) or the Asian populations (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.56-1.77, p = 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> and publication bias existed in this meta-analysis, which might have affected the analysis result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis suggests that the AT1R gene A1166C polymorphisms are not associated with susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
