<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radioactivity from labeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinylestradiol</z:chebi> added to the sera before precipitation was monitored in the precipitates to detect anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinylestradiol</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences for these parameters in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, protein content and 3H-EE activity in the precipitates were equally and dramatically reduced after affinity chromatography in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These latter results do not support the presence of antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinylestradiol</z:chebi> in steroid users with cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our data suggest a lack of specificity of Beaumont's method for the isolation of immune complexes containing anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinylestradiol</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
