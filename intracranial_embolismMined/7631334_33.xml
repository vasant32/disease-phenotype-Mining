<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several studies have shown <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to vary by season, day of the week, and time of day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These temporal patterns, which may provide insights into pathogenesis, were found mainly in clinical series, which can be subject to selection bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To obtain a less distorted picture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, we examined the month and season, day of the week, time, and place <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in a community-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 40-year period of surveillance of the Framingham Study cohort of 5070 people aged 30 to 62 years and free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> at entry, 637 completed initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Month, season, day of the week, time of day, and place of occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were ascertained systematically and related prospectively to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence, subtype, and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Winter was the peak season for cerebral embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events occurred on Mondays than any other day, particularly for working men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo>, a third happened on Mondays in both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time of day when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> most frequently occurred was between 8 AM and noon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This pattern was true for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This pattern persisted when individuals whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> occurred while sleeping or on awakening were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> in general occurred more at home, with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurring outside the home and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> in the hospital more than other subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Temporal patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were observed for season, day of the week, time of day, and place in a community-based population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that there are periods of increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that may be amenable to preventive strategies </plain></SENT>
