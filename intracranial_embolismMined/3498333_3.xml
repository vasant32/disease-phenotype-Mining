<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Certainly the orbit and optic nerve/sheath complex have demonstrated a great number of pathologic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anatomic variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> that what was previously thought to be simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in fact masks a surprisingly large component of optic papilla protrusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There may be a variable amount of increased intercellular/axonal fluid within the optic disk in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>; however, a significant factor in the "swollen disk" is the simple transmission of pressure along the optic nerve sheath to the papilla, causing it to bulge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further investigations with dynamic CT reveal that there is decreased perfusion of the optic disk in the active phase of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and/or protrusion as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This depressed flow pattern seems to originate subacutely and appears to resolve in certain patients after normalization of the elevated pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings apparently indicate that clinical intervention in cases of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> to restore the hemodynamic status of the optic disk would be timely, and thereby avert irreversible damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests and supports the theory that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> may lead to rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> by the mechanical mechanism of pressure projected directly to the junction of the optic nerve and optic nerve head, leading to decreased perfusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, axonal flow stasis, and resultant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
