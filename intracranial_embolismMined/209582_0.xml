<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain samples for determination of cAMP by a protein binding radioassay were obtained from the ischemic and contralateral temporal lobes before sacrifice, 1, 3, and 24 hours after occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 1 hour, no difference between the 2 sides was observed; a mean of 17.4 pmoles/mg protein was observed from the side of the occlusion and 18.9 pmoles/mg protein from the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 3 hours, a mean value of 8.9 pmoles/mg protein on the ischemic side and a level of 21.7 pmoles/mg protein on the contralateral side were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, the cAMP level on the ischemic side remained below the nonischemic side; the values obtained were 13.7 pmoles/mg protein compared to 27.9 pmoles/mg protein compared to 27.9 pmoles/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes in cAMP as early as 3 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, when such a lesion is reversible, may indicate that in initial step in the alteration of cellular metabolism following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is due to membrane perturbation and altered production of this second messenger </plain></SENT>
