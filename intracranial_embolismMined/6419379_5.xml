<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FVIIIR:Ag was significantly (P less than 0.001) increased in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and recovery phase as compared to 108 healthy controls, although slightly decreased in recovery than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The persistently high FVIIIR:Ag levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase are unlikely to be caused by the so-called <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reaction but are probably due to increased synthesis and endothelial changes in <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> releasing FVIIIR:Ag from its endothelial pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It suggested that increased FVIIIR:Ag mainly reflects the degree of vascular involvement and it may be used as a marker (or indicator) of arterial endothelial injury in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
