<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one rats were subjected to right middle cerebral artery embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and sacrificed 96 h following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brains were harvested and stained immediately after sacrifice or stored for 8 h at 21-23 degrees C or 4 degrees C, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The stained sections were scanned and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The quality of staining, distinction of borders between infarcted and non-ischemic tissue and ease of differentiating ischemic tissue in colored and grayscale images was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that results of TTC obtained immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277684" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">animal sacrifice</z:e>, or delayed TTC staining while storing the brains at room temperature or 4 degrees C are comparable </plain></SENT>
