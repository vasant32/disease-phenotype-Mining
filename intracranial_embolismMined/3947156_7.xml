<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The need for shunting was based on a correlation between electroencephalographic changes and a fall in cerebral blood flow below the critical level required for adequate perfusion during the period of carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into four risk categories for surgery, based on medical and neurological risks and angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Shunts were required in 30% of the low risk group and 56% of the high risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the severity of reductions of cerebral blood flow during the period of carotid occlusion it is concluded that 12% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients would have sustained a major deficit, 15% a minor or transient deficit, and 20% a transient deficit without shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of shunting 792 cases in this series was 0.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall minor morbidity, major morbidity, and mortality each approximated 1% in this series </plain></SENT>
