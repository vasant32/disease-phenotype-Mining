<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>M-mode and 2D echocardiography were performed in four age- and gender-matched groups: 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with NVAF, 20 patients with NVAF who had not suffered a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with sinus rhythm, and 40 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 77 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> differed from healthy controls in that they had more 2D-echocardiographic findings of severe left-ventricular-wall-motion abnormalities (p &lt; 0.05) and tended more often to have <z:mp ids='MP_0010579'>enlarged left ventricles</z:mp>, and hypertrophic and congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left atrial diameter was 47 mm compared to 41 and 39 mm in the two groups with sinus rhythm (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were only found in the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial-fibrillation</z:hpo> groups (with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: 15% without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> was common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (30-60%), as was mitral annulus calcification (10-20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only significant difference between the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial-fibrillation</z:hpo> groups was a higher frequency of earlier <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
