<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decrease in consciousness occurred with resultant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, focal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> and the occasional appearance of a state of akinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002300'>mutism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological abnormalities consisted of multifocal areas of infarction in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia in five patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206083" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">central pontine myelinolysis</z:e> in five (often more extensive than usually reported), Wernicke's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> in three, glial nodules in two, and fungal abscesses in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alzheimer II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brains available for retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was direct evidence in two of the patients that air embolization from the homografts had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation of this with the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in these and other cases seems reasonable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ease with which air passed to the systemic circulation is explicable by the right to left venous--arterial shunts that are common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the delination of this cause for the neurologic complications, measures to prevent it in future cases have been described </plain></SENT>
