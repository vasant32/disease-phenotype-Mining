<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two major mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one group, the angiographic intracranial abnormalities strongly suggested the presence of embolism in the cerebral vessels supplied by the stenotic or occluded carotid artery; many of these patients had no obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> prior to their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and experienced a moderate to severe clinical deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other group, evidence of embolism was absent; many showed a widespread delay in cerebral arterial perfusion, experienced a greater frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> before their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and had a milder <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than did those with embolism </plain></SENT>
