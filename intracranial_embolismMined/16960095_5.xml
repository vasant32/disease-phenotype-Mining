<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is an uncommon but devastating complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is possible that delay in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> revascularization of these patients influences the risk of peri-MI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> independent of size of infarction or residual ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The influence of the timing and type of revascularization on risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the patient with MI has not previously been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the National Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> 3 and 4 databases to identify 45,997 subjects who received thrombolytic therapy and 47,876 patients who were treated with primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 248 (0.54%) and 150 (0.31%) patients in the two groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified based on time from presentation to initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant linear relationship between time to revascularization therapy and risk of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was seen on univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multivariate model incorporating 26 other variables showed thrombolytic therapy within 15 minutes was associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Primary angioplasty within 90 minutes of arrival was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.41-1.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, his benefit of early reperfusion therapy did not appear to be related to improvements in left ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with MI is closely tied to the time to revascularization with both thrombolytic and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early revascularization is independently predictive of a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but the mechanism of this does not appear to be related to improved cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The records of 45,997 subjects who received thrombolytic therapy and 47,876 patients who were treated with primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were analyzed to determine the relationship between time to revascularization and the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant linear relationship between time to revascularization therapy and risk of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was seen on univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A multivariate model incorporating 26 other variables showed thrombolytic therapy within 15 minutes of presentation was associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and angioplasty within 90 minutes was similarly associated with a nonsignificant trend toward lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
