<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study's aim is to derive combined PMD/sgTCD microemboli criteria to overcome this limitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> were prospectively enrolled within 24 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> underwent 1 hour TCD emboli monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed disparity between PMD <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> criteria and sgTCD <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared combined PMD/sgTCD criteria to sgTCD alone criteria by measuring the intraclass correlation coefficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 92 patients, 28 patients had evidence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> on sgTCD or PMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> count was 269 based on sgTCD criteria, and 326 based on combined PMD/sgTCD criteria (P= 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined PMD/sgTCD criteria revealed 17 MESs (4.8%) based on sgTCD criteria to represent artifacts and 57 MESs (17.5%) not to be detected by sgTCD criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> based on sgTCD criteria was 0.67 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58-0.74]; however, introducing combined PMD/sgTCD criteria resulted in a significant increase in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>, 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88-0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our combined PMD/sgTCD criteria for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> appeared to improve the yield of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reliability in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection interpretation was improved when combined PMD/sgTCD criteria was applied </plain></SENT>
