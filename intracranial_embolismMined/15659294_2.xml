<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our recent study demonstrated that nefiracetam, N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-2-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27856">acetamide</z:chebi>, prevented impairment of the cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> (cAMP)/cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB) protein signaling pathway in sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine whether nefiracetam has an effect on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and synapsin I <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> that are believed to be produced via CREB, and the alteration in their protein contents in the hippocampus after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by injection of 700 microspheres into the right hemisphere of each rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were treated once daily with 10 mg/kg nefiracetam, p.o., from 15 h after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with nefiracetam reduced the prolongation of the escape latency in the water maze test on days 7-9 after microsphere embolism-induced sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, suggesting an improvement in the spatial learning function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microsphere-embolized rats on day 5 showed decreases in BDNF and synapsin I <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and their protein contents in the ipsilateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with nefiracetam partially attenuated the decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that enhancement of BDNF and synapsin I expression by nefiracetam treatment may be, at least in part, due to the improvement in the CREB binding activity, contributing to the prevention of learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunction</z:e> after sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
