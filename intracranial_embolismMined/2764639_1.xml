<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two rat models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in passive avoidance learning induced by cerebrovascular disturbance, were established to estimate the effects of a cerebral metabolic enhancer, idebenone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient and global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats, produced by 4-vessel occlusion for 200 s immediately after the acquisition trial of passive avoidance learning, shortened the latencies in the retention test trial performed 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002624" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">retrograde amnesia</z:e> was reversed significantly by idebenone administered orally or intraperitoneally at the doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg before the retention test trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Idebenone at a dose of 10 mg/kg, given intraperitoneally before or immediately after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, also markedly inhibited the appearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second model, permanent and cerebral hemisphere embolization produced by injecting 2,000 microspheres into the internal carotid artery, significantly impaired passive avoidance learning performed 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The repeated administration of idebenone (30 mg/kg, i.p.). once a day after the embolization, significantly improved the impairment of passive avoidance learning in the embolized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27953">physostigmine</z:chebi> and arginine-vasopressin as reference compounds improved the impairment of passive avoidance learning in these models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that idebenone ameliorates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> induced by cerebral vascular disturbance in rats </plain></SENT>
