<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the 20 patients of the embolic group, a large homogeneous low attenuation area was seen in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 18 of these 20 patients, the low attenuation area extended from the deep brain to the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 12 patients of the thrombotic group, 10 had an inhomogeneous low attenuation area that did not involve the cortices in 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of hemorrhagic transformation in the embolic group was higher than in the thrombotic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography showed discrete areas of increased attenuation corresponding to an angiographically occluded artery in 7 of the 20 patients in the embolic group </plain></SENT>
