<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The merits of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients remains matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-one consecutive patients with a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for which no definite cause and indication for anticoagulation was assessed after standardized work-up underwent TTE and TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic findings were categorized into minor and major risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A potential cardiac source of embolism was detected in 55% (127/ 231) of the patients by echocardiography, in 39% (90/231) only identified on TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major risk factors, with an absolute indication for oral anticoagulation, were detected in 20% (46/231) of the patients, in 16% (38/231) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients identified on TEE only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the left atrial appendage was the most common major risk factor (38 patients, 16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of major risk factors was independent of age (chi2=1.48; P=0.224) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in proportions of cardiac sources detected in favor of TEE was highly significant in both patients &lt; or = 45 years of age (10/39, P=0.002) and in those &gt; 45 years of age (80/192; P&lt;0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TEE proved superior to TTE for identification of a cardiac embolic source in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without pre-existent indication or contraindication for anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TTE, a cardiac source of embolism was detected by TEE in approximately 40% of patients, independent of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More than 1 of 8 patients of any age with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TTE revealed a major cardiac risk factor on TEE, in whom anticoagulation is warranted </plain></SENT>
