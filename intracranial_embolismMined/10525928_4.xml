<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During a one year period 65 patients (22 female, 43 male, mean age: 73 years, 47 with neurologic symptoms, 8 with contralateral carotid occlusion) with significant (&gt;70%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were treated with balloon angioplasty and balloon expandable stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary technical success rate was 98% (65/66 patients) respectively 99% (69/70 stenoses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combined procedure was performed in 11 /17%) patients with stenting in both carotid arteries in 4 patients with additional coronary interventions in 6 patients and stenting of the origin of the common carotid artery in one patient.Severe neurologic complications occurred in 4 (6.2%) patients (1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 1 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 2 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) and short lasting neurologic deficits in additional 4 (6.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular complications were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local (inguinal) problems occurred in 3 (4.5%) patients (2 aneurysma spuria, 1 transfusion for <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequently, balloon insufflation was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> (40%) and additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, carotid stenting can be performed with technically high success rates (99%), but it is adversely influenced by not infrequent thromboembolic cerebral events (12.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possibility to perform combined procedures with interventions in other vessels (both carotid arteries, coronary arteries, aortic arch arteries) is advantageous </plain></SENT>
