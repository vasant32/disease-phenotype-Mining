<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our single-center experience of interventional closure of interatrial communications for secondary prevention of presumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- Since 1997, percutaneous closure of interatrial communications was performed at our institution in 66 patients (mean age 47.8+/-12.7 years; 31 males) with a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> or an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> and at least 1 documented presumed paradoxical thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, 10 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264686" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary embolism</z:e>, and 3 had peripheral embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several patients experienced multilocal arterial embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients had a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, 33 of them with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, and 12 had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The implantation procedure was successful and without complication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 3 months, only 2 patients showed a residual shunt, which disappeared in both cases after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 112.2 patient-years of follow-up (range, 5 weeks to 3.5 years), we have not seen any recurrent thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interventional closure of interatrial communications is a safe and effective therapeutic option for the secondary prevention of presumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate this strategy, randomized trials comparing interventional closure with anticoagulation have been initiated by us and others </plain></SENT>
