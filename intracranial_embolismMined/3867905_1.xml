<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was performed on 59 Chinese males, in whom 31 were patients with thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> affecting the cerebral cortex diagnosed by neurological examination and computed tomography; and the others grouped as healthy control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age and Broca index of both groups were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in the thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> was significantly lower and correlated inversely with both significantly higher levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (r=-0.5392, p less than 0.01) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47776">VLDL-triglyceride</z:chebi> (r=-0.5866, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of total <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> were also significantly higher in patient with thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean area percentage of HDL2b subfraction measured in the diameter range as determined by gradient gel electrophoresis was significantly lower and HDL2 also showed the same tendency in patients with thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our finding was consistent with the postulation that HDL2 or HDL2b in in particular, probably played a more protective role than any other <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subfractions against thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, one of the major atherosclerotic complications </plain></SENT>
