<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autologous blood clot formed spontaneously (within 2 h) in a catheter fixed in the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of embolization were investigated on arterial blood pressure, respiration, local cerebral blood flow, locally available O2 (aO2), steady (DC) potentials and EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After embolization the blood pressure and the frequency of respiration decreased transiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the embolized side the local cerebral blood flow, aO2, the frequency and amplitude of the EEG diminished markedly and the DC potentials shifted to negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar but less marked and short-lasting changes could be seen on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination of the brains revealed extensive infarction with haemorrhagic components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The technique is a promising method for inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> experimentally and offers various ways for its thorough investigation </plain></SENT>
