<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tenecteplase (TNK) was engineered to have increased fibrin specificity and an increased half-life compared to Alteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although Tenecteplase is currently being tested in a Phase II clinical trial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, little is known about the pharmacology and dose-response or therapeutic window for Tenecteplase in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared Tenecteplase with Alteplase on behavioral outcome in rabbits with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male New Zealand white rabbits were embolized by injecting a suspension of small blood clots into the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) via a catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rabbit small clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model (RSCEM) was used for a dose-response profile analysis of Tenecteplase (0.1 mg/kg-3.3 mg/kg) and Alteplase (0.9 mg/kg-3.3 mg/kg) given intravenously 1 h following embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In additional studies, Tenecteplase (0.9 mg/kg) or Alteplase (3.3 mg/kg) was administered 3 (or 6) h following embolization to determine the therapeutic window for the thrombolytics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For both studies, behavioral analysis was conducted 24 h following embolization, allowing for the determination of the effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> dose (P50) or clot amount (mg) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the RSCEM, a drug is considered beneficial if it significantly increases the P50 compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The P50 of controls 24 h after embolization was 1.13 +/- 0.15 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rabbits treated 1 h post-embolization with Tenecteplase (0.1, 0.25, 0.9, 1.5 or 3.3 mg/kg) had P50 values of 1.48 +/- 0.33, 2.20 +/- 0.44, 2.76 +/- 0.37, 2.15 +/- 0.29 and 2.78 +/- 0.31 mg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Alteplase-treated rabbits, only the 3.3 mg/kg dose significantly increased the group P50 by 189% compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tenecteplase was also effective at increasing the P50 value to 2.21 +/- 0.43 mg if there was a 3-h delay following embolization, but not if there was a 6-h delay before administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Alteplase was only effective if administered 1 h following embolization where it significantly increased the P50 value to 3.27 +/- 0.40 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that Tenecteplase has a wide therapeutic range, a therapeutic window of at least 3 h and a durable effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the safety profile for Tenecteplase is similar to that of Alteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Tenecteplase does not increase the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) above that produced by Alteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the therapeutic range and window for Alteplase is more limited than that for Tenecteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our preclinical studies suggest that Tenecteplase has a better pharmacological profile than Alteplase and supports further investigation of Tenecteplase in randomized double-blinded clinical trials in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
