<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathologic examination of the embolectomy specimen revealed fibrin platelet aggregates with rare white and red blood cells, consistent with a "white <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>." We conclude that routine monitoring of platelet count should be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients receiving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> to identify promptly individuals who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and when thromboembolic complications occur in this setting, echocardiography is indicated to identify possible intracardiac sources for emboli, even in patients with previously known structurally intact hearts </plain></SENT>
