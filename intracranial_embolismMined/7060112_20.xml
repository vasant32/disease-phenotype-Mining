<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In common with reports from other catheter laboratories, the mortality has fallen from 0.74% (952 patients) between 1971 and 1975 to 0.24% (819) patients between 1976 and 1979 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There has been a similar decline in the combined incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> from 1.05% to 0.24% over the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> included many at high risk of complications in that three vessel disease was present in 53% and the ejection fraction was less than 50% in 24% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to ensure that the best standards of cardiac catheterization are maintained, we agree with a recent suggestion that there should be a national surveillance program monitoring fatality and complication rates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> catheterization laboratories </plain></SENT>
