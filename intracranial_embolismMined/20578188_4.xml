<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to carotid endoarterectomy also in elderly patients with discrepant results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the use of proximal neuroprotection devices have not been evaluated in octogenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this multicenter prospective registry was to demonstrate that CAS in octogenarians is safe and effective if performed in high-volume centers by experienced operators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 2005 to May 2009, a total of 198 octogenarians patients, in three different institutions, were included in this registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent CAS using proximal endovascular occlusion device (Mo.Ma. device Invatec, Roncadelle, Italy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An independent neurologist evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 198 octogenarians (135 men; mean age: 83.2 years) were included in the registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>39.4% of the patients were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procedural success was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In-hospital complications: Two minor and two major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2.02%) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No device-related complications and no serious access site complication were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Between discharge and 30-day follow-up, one patient died due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall 30-day combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 2.52%, resulting in 1.61% event incidence in asymptomatic and 3.9% in symptomatic patients (P = ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression did not identify independent predictor of neurological events, except in the female gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This multicenter prospective registry shows that CAS performed with proximal flow blockage is safe and feasible also in octogenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thirty days <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates are similar to those of the overall population and within the International guidelines </plain></SENT>
