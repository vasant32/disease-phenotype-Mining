<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The detection of asymptomatic embolization with the use of Doppler ultrasound has a number of potential applications in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may provide information on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathogenesis in individual cases, identify patients with continued embolization, and allow localization of the active embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 119 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior circulation infarction within 72 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler recordings were possible in 100 (84.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral 1-hour middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) recordings were made and saved on digital audiotape for blinded offline analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When embolic signals were detected during screening of the first recording, simultaneous recording was performed from the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and common carotid artery for an additional 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with embolic signals at screening and in matched negative controls, recordings were repeated on days 4, 7, and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Embolic signals were detected in the symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in 16 patients (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were more common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.0001), occurring in 50% of this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were rare in patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (4.5%) and were not detected in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the 16 patients with embolic signals, the proportion with embolic signals fell over time (P=0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>0025), but they were still present in a third at 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients, localization of the embolic source was possible by simultaneous recording from the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and the ipsilateral common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Continued asymptomatic embolization is common after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> and is still present in a significant proportion at 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The technique may identify patients at risk of further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for more aggressive antiplatelet therapy; this needs to be tested in large prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The technique may also allow localization of the active embolic source </plain></SENT>
