<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The period most frequently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> is the one during the clamping of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case whereby <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hypoperfusion, as detected by ipsilateral hemispheric slowing and attenuation of the fast frequencies on EEG, was detected in the period prior to clamping of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes were caused by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following emergent treatment with intraoperative thrombolytic therapy with intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) the EEG changes reversed fully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We discuss the utility of intraoperative EEG monitoring in the detection and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ability of EEG to intraoperatively measure the function of the at-risk cerebral cortex makes it not only a useful tool in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes such as from a large embolism, but also in guiding necessary treatment by offering direct feedback in the absence of reliable imaging and clinical examination </plain></SENT>
