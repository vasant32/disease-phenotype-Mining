<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed transesophageal echocardiography in 50 consecutive hospitalized patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of embolic origin to determine whether transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in detection of possible intracardiac sources of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of 50 patients with a negative transthoracic echocardiogram for potential source of emboli had a transesophageal echocardiography study that demonstrated at least one intracardiac abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities noted by transesophageal echocardiography included five of 50 patients with either a left atrial or left atrial appendage clot, four patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, and nine patients with spontaneous echocardiographic contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 11 of 50 patients with no other source of embolism, we found highly mobile filamentous strands on the mitral valve, which have not been described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These mitral valve echo strands may represent a fissured surface or <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> that can serve as a nidus for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected no unexpected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0587044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular thrombus</z:e> or left <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly associated with a greater likelihood of a positive transesophageal echocardiography study included left atrial enlargement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and a calcified or <z:mp ids='MP_0010620'>thickened mitral valve</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that transesophageal echocardiography is a valuable addition to transthoracic echocardiography in investigating potential intracardiac sources of embolism </plain></SENT>
