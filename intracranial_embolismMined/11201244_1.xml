<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microsphere embolism was induced by injection of 900 microspheres with a diameter of 48 microm into the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The retention latency of a passive avoidance test was shortened and the escape latency of a water maze test was prolonged, when the animals were tested on the 5th to 10th day after the embolism, suggesting learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cholinergic parameters of the striatum and hippocampus, such as <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) content (67 and 60% decrease, respectively), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity (45 and 56% decrease, respectively), and Bmax of muscarinic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> M1-receptor (43 and 37% decrease, respectively), were reduced on the 11th day after the embolism, suggesting attenuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> synthesis and a decrease in the number of muscarinic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> M1-receptors mainly in the striatum and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Areas not stained with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, an indication of infarction, were detected mainly in the striatum and hippocampus and partly in the frontal cortex on the 11th day after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that an animal with microsphere embolism may be a good ischemic model with relatively sustained impairments of learning and memory function and of the striatal and hippocampal cholinergic system </plain></SENT>
