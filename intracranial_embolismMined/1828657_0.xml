<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of them with coarctation after surgical correction, the rest were native Ao Co </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used one balloon in 28 patients and two balloons simultaneously in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were separated in three groups according to the degree of aortic arc <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group I (mild to moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> N = 9) the gradient dropped 39% with angiographic improvement of 48% during the follow-up (m = 13.1 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three cases with restenosis, 2 were satisfactory dilated and one was sent to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group II (severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> N = 4) the gradient dropped 31% with angiographic improvement of 30% (follow-up 16.3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two cases with recoarctation were sent to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Group III (without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> N = 21) we obtained dropped of gradient of 71% with angiographic improvement of 60% (follow-up 18.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two cases were redilated successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The complications were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100735'>hypertensive crisis</z:hpo>, (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, (1) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the puncture site 1 and small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in dilated zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(1) We think <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> is a good choice to conventional surgery with low rate of morbidity-mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results depend basically on the anatomic type of coarctation and degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0010485'>aortic arch hypoplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
