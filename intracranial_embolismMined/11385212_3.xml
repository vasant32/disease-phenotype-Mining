<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, high-intensity transient signals detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) have been related to particulate microemboli originating at the stenotic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of these microembolic events within the Doppler spectrum should be influenced by antithrombotic agents of proven efficacy in these patients mainly by reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-four of 192 consecutive patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> in the anterior circulation and clinical symptoms within the last 30 days underwent 1-hour bilateral TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were selected, if they presented temporal bone windows enabling transcranial insonation, revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Doppler <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> test excluding hemodynamic impairment, had not received antithrombotic therapy other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) before sonographic examination, and gave informed consent to 1-hour monitoring which could be performed immediately on admission/presentation of the patient at the Department of Neurology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microembolic events were detected in 38 patients (51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with events among 26 patients without antithrombotic medication was 73% as compared with 40% in 48 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> at the time of TCD monitoring (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis including time from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to TCD, presence and start of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> prevention, degree and localization of stenosis, and presence of a single or recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> revealed that absence of an <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> prevention (odds ratio OR 7.1, 95% confidence interval CI 1.6-31.4, p = 0.010), recurrent ischemic events (OR 7.1, 95% CI 1.6-32.7, p = 0.011), and extracranial localization of the stenosis (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.1-13.2, p = 0.038) were independent predictors for microembolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo>, the absence of an <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> medication is associated with the occurrence of TCD-detected microembolic events, suggesting a relation between these events and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>-sensitive microemboli from the stenotic lesion </plain></SENT>
