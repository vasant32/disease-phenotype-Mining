<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Up to now it is unknown which mechanisms are responsible for this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As shown previously photothrombotic infarction in rat neocortex leads to a sweeping suppression of GABAergic inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated whether and to what extent epileptiform discharges can be observed in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In neocortical slices from lesioned animals we did not find spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> activity or paroxysmal depolarisation shifts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, ipsi- and contralateral to a photothrombotic lesion the frequency of double and multiple discharges was markedly increased when compared to unlesioned controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, neither the drug lubeluzole which was has been shown to prevent the GABAergic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo> observed after photothrombotic lesioning of rat neocortex, nor the prevention of spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801 during lesion induction significantly affected the frequency of epileptiform discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the epileptiform discharges are probably caused by functional alterations of glutamatergic receptors </plain></SENT>
