<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Visualization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> without contrast was obtained on CT scan in 49% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> between 2 and 2.5 cm in diameter (A 1 group) and in 80% of patients with larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (A 2 group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contrast enhancement was homogeneous in 49% of patients, not homogeneous--with central or peripheral hypodensity--in 47% of patients, absent in 4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ventricular shift was present in 17% of A 1 patients and in 36% of A 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypodense areas were observed in 12% of cases, and calcifications in 19% of cases; bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On angiography, the most common aneurysmal locations were the intracavernous carotid (21% of cases) and the middle cerebral artery (23% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A neck could be identified on angiography in only 14% of patients, and stenosis of afferent vessel in 16% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was rarely observed on angiography (17% of A 1 and 10% of A 2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (partial, subtotal or total) was present in 48% of A 1 and 76% of A 2 patients (p less than 0.001); partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002641'>peripheral thrombosis</z:hpo> was most commonly observed (one half of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Round or oval shapes were most commonly observed, while fusiform, irregular, <z:chebi fb="107" ids="46670,9119">serpentine</z:chebi> or doughnut shapes were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A few clinical/radiological relations were considered, such as the relation between partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and haemorrhage, symptoms of expanding mass lesion, ischaemic episodes, aneurysmal location.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
