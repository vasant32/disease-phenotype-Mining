<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to document the prevalence, radiologic appearance, and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> related to GDC embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical and radiologic records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing GDC treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> at our institution were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases in which unexpected complications occurred were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those complications related to presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 59 patients (60 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>) treated with GDCs, 17 (28%) experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and 10 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients, the deficits occurred during or immediately after the procedure; in the rest, the complications were delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> radiologic investigations were negative for infarction and in seven patients, CT scans showed new ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging alone showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and in four of nine patients who underwent subsequent angiography, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic findings were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were treated with volume expansion, eight with full heparinization, and one patient underwent intraarterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was excellent or good in 14 of 17 patients, with only three patients (5%) incurring permanent neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic events</z:hpo> related to GDC treatment may be more common than has been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our experience, this rate was 28%, with persisting deficits in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These events can occur after uncomplicated procedures and may be unaccompanied by radiologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome is usually favorable </plain></SENT>
