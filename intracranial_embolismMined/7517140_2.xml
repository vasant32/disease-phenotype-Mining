<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effects of nefiracetam on cerebral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> metabolism in rats after microsphere-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> have been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For cerebral embolization, microspheres were injected into the left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nefiracetam (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg p.o.) was administered daily to the animals for 13 days from the 9th day after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, DOPAC and HVA in the control (embolism-induced, but untreated) group were significantly decreased compared with those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (non-operated) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In animals treated with nefiracetam (3 mg/kg p.o.), these <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> levels were higher than controls in the cortex and hippocampus, whereas they were not significantly changed in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> contents in the control group significantly decreased from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in the cortex and hippocampus, on which nefiracetam at various doses had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of 5-HIAA in the control group also decreased, which were, however, significantly increased by 3 mg/kg of nefiracetam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that nefiracetam has improving actions on the dysfunction of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
