<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Published data describing scintigraphic evaluation of perfusion changes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002408'>cerebral arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) after embolization are very scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate these changes by using Tc-ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32457">cysteinate</z:chebi> dimer single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The examinations were performed in 20 patients before and after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Voxel-based analysis was used for semiquantitative assessment of single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypoperfusion in basal single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography was diagnosed when asymmetry index was higher than 10% in a cluster volume (CV) greater than 10.0 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The change of perfusion between basal and control studies was considered significant when relative difference (RD) was higher than 10% in a CV greater than 10 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Obliteration of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> was total or nearly total in 12 patients and partial in 8 patients, No serious complications were observed after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before embolization hypoperfusion in the region of an <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was seen in 17 cases, perfusion defects in areas distant from an <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> were found in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After embolization, perfusion around an <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> deteriorated in 11 patients (CV=10.7-68.7 ml, mean 28.6+/-18.4, RD=14-26%, mean 17.8+/-4.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvement was seen in three cases (CV=13.7-17.7 ml, mean 16+/-2, RD=16.5-20.1%, mean 18.2+/-1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Perfusion deterioration in areas distant from <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> was found in nine cases, improvement in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The changes of perfusion caused by endovascular embolization of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> can rely on both deterioration and improvement, and occur in the parenchyma surrounding the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> and in the distant regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although deterioration of perfusion indicated that more frequent follow-up was necessary, it was not related with serious complications in our group of patients </plain></SENT>
