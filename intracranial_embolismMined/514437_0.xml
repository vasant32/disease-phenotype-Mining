<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The average annual incidence rates reached 203 for males, 176--for females, and 189 for both sexes per (100,000) 181, 167 and 174 respectively when cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mortality rates in those cases were estimated to be 103, 82 and 92 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nearly 70 percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were admitted to neurological departments, and 14 percent remained at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted incidence rates for subarachnoidal haemorrhage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> were three times higher, and the total incidence rate--twice higher than the rates estimated previously for the Warsaw population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that the incidence rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> based exclusively on data from neurological departments are underestimated by at least 30 percent, and this bias varies according to the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
