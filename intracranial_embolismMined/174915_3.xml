<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> of the carotid area (less than 14 days after the attack) revealed a significant increase in CSF cAMP level in comparison to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and cephalagia without any pathological findings (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A trend towards elevated values was observed also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, whereas the CSF cAMP concentrations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of at least 2 months of duration were in the range of control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant rise in CSF enzyme activities was observed only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>hemorrhagic disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypertensive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> showed significantly higher CSF cAMP values than normotensive ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar positive correlation between blood pressure and CSF aAMP concentrations was found also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the present results it is suggested that in cerebrovascular diseases CSF cAMP concentration reflects the size and the time of the destruction of cerebral cells, and correlates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> of the patient possibly indicating an increased sympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
