<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the clinical, laboratory, radiological, and prospective historical features of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in patients with &gt;100 GPL titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From our neurology department, 27 consecutive patients were prospectively identified and followed up (mean follow-up time, 34 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of our cohort was 41 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lupuslike illness occurred in 3; 23 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, including 3 who met criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e>; 1 patient had progressive systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occurred in 74% and were recurrent in 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic ischemic events, most commonly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, occurred in 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tobacco use was documented in 85%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> in 74%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 44%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in 7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> history was present in 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) was present in 72%, approximately one half had positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and one quarter had a false-positive VDRL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We compared mean GPL levels in patients testing positive for specific laboratory features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> with those testing negative for these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only the LA(+) group had a significantly higher mean GPL than the LA(-) group (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Brain imaging showed nonlacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 73% and lacunes in 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of 19 cerebral angiograms, 5 (26%) showed large-vessel occlusive disease and 6 (32%) branch obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Echocardiograms were abnormal in 75%: thickened left-sided valves in 33% and vegetations in 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recurrent cerebrovascular ischemic events were observed in 96%, with transient events (mean rate, 25%/y) occurring 5 times more frequently than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (mean rate, 5%/y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Using a standardized disability scale blinded to aCL titer, neurological impairment was severe in 7%, moderate in 30%, and mild or nonexistent in 63%, and unrelated to mean GPL value (P=0.567) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Titers fluctuated greatly for individual patients, and most did not consistently test as highly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>An analysis of fluctuation in symptom severity with concurrent GPL values did not show a statistically significant correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Compared with historical controls having a wide range of positive titers, the presence of high IgG aCL titers did not confer a worse prognosis for disability and recurrent ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that cerebrovascular events associated with high positive GPL are frequently multiple and minor (with no disability-titer correlation), present in relatively young patients, and often associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040336" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">tobacco abuse</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, LA, systemic ischemic events, and occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
