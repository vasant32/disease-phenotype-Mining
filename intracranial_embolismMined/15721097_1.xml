<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although transesophageal echocardiographically derived parameters, notably spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (SEC) in the left atrium or left atrial appendage (LAA), are known predictors of embolism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, their value is less well known in patients who have lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (LAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes transesophageal echocardiographic findings and identifies clinical predictors of SEC in the left atrium or LAA in a cohort of patients who had LAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two patients who had LAF and 289 patients who had non-LAF and underwent transesophageal echocardiography were enrolled from July 1998 to March 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LAA abnormality was defined as the presence of an LAA area &gt;5 cm(2), emptying or filling LAA velocities &lt;25 cm/s, or the presence of SEC or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the left atrium or LAA; LAA abnormalities were significantly less frequent in patients who had LAF than in those who had non-LAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SEC in the left atrium or LAA was significantly less frequent in patients who had LAF than in those who had non-LAF (29.3% vs 49.8%, respectively, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients who had LAF, SEC in the left atrium or LAA was significantly (p &lt;0.05) less frequent in patients who were &lt;/=60 years old (17.9%) than in patients who were &gt;60 years old (39.5%) and in patients who had paroxysmal LAF (5.9%) than in those who had persistent LAF (45.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, age and persistent LAF were the only clinical variables independently associated with SEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, transesophageal echocardiography detects <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> risk markers in patients who have LAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities are less frequent in patients who have LAF than in those who are at low risk and have non-LAF; however, in patients who have LAF, older age and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> are associated with these risk markers </plain></SENT>
