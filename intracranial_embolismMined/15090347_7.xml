<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular detachable coil is being increasingly used for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> but little information is available about its feasibility and effectiveness in people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed clinical outcomes in elderly patients with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with selective embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1996 and 2002, 68 patients aged 65-80 years (mean age, 71 years) were treated by selective embolization with coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 34 had a Hunt and Hess (HH) grade of I or II; 15, an HH grade of III; and 19, an HH grade of IV or V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients except four were treated within 72 hours after initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>; those four patients had an HH grade of IV or V and were treated at 3-6 weeks after their clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were assessed by using the Modified Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of follow-up was 20 months (range, 6-36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endovascular treatment resulted in 47 complete occlusions (69%), 15 neck remnants (22%), and six incomplete occlusions (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Procedural complications occurred in eight patients (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were good or excellent in 40 patients (59%), including the four treated 3-6 weeks after initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A fair or poor outcome was observed in 14 patients (20.5%), including two with an HH grade of I or II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 14 patients (20.5%) who died, 13 (93%) had an HH grade of IV or V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No rebleeding occurred during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endosaccular coiling may be proposed in elderly people with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with HH grade IV or V lesions, morbidity and mortality rates remain high, and embolization should be considered only after their clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
