<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of thrombolytic therapy was studied in rats submitted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> by intracarotid injection of autologous blood clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis was initiated after 15 minutes with an intracarotid infusion of recombinant tissue-type activator (10 mg/kg body weight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion was monitored for 3 hours using serial perfusion- and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, and the outcome of treatment was quantified by pictorial measurements of ATP, tissue pH, and blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In untreated animals, clot embolism resulted in an immediate decrease in blood flow and a sharp decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) that persisted throughout the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis successfully recanalized the embolized middle cerebral artery origin and led to gradual improvement of blood flow and a slowly progressing reversal of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> changes in the periphery of the ischemic territory, but only to transient and partial improvement in the center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three hours after initiation of thrombolysis, the tissue volume with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values less than 80% of control was 39 +/- 22% as compared to 61 +/- 20% of ipsilateral hemisphere in untreated animals (means +/- SD, P = .03) and the volume of ATP-depleted brain tissue was 25 +/- 31% as compared to 46 +/- 29% in untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recovery of ischemic brain injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> is incomplete even when therapy is started as early as 15 minutes after clot embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possible explanations for our findings include downstream displacement of clot material, microembolism of the vascular periphery, and events associated with reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
