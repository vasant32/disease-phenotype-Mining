<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: If blood flow in the ICA is reduced by the use of a distal filter during CAS, flow stagnation proximal to the filter occurs and this increases the probability of floating debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The floating debris that remains after filter retrieval may cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, if blood flow is increased by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of blood from the ICA through an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> catheter, debris could be removed while the filter is still in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate blood flow changes in the ICA induced by filter use and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A filter-protection device (AngioGuard XP) was used during CAS in 13 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocity in the ICA was measured by carotid Doppler sonography during filter deployment, filter retrieval, and catheter <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood flow velocity significantly decreased with filter placement and significantly increased with filter retrieval in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> angiographic flow (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo> of a 20-mL blood sample from the proximal ICA column significantly increased the blood flow velocity (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The blood flow changes in the ICA induced by the use of a distal filter may cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in filter-protected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> method can potentially reduce the amount of migrating debris during CAS, even in cases with angiographic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow </plain></SENT>
