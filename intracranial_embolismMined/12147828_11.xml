<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess, with magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging, the number and size of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> after carotid angioplasty and stent placement (CAS) and to evaluate the association of these new lesions with neurologic deficits and transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic (US) data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive CAS procedures were performed in 72 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent neurologic examination before, during, immediately after, and 1 day, 3 months, and 1 year after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was used before and after CAS to assess the number of symptomatic and silent new infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pre- and postintervention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The radiologists were blinded to the clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postprocedural <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images showed new lesions on the side of stent placement in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six patients, the new lesions were clinically silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, one had a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients who had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> before CAS, the frequency of new lesions at postprocedural <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was higher (23%) than in asymptomatic patients (12%); this difference was not statistically significant (P =.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant correlation between embolic load as detected with transcranial Doppler US monitoring and the occurrence of either clinical symptoms or new lesions seen at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CAS is associated with embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The majority of new lesions seen on postintervention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images are not detected at neurologic examination </plain></SENT>
