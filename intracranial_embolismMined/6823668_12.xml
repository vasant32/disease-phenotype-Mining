<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients underwent ligation of the internal carotid artery for a variety of clinical indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These included cerebral embolization from surgically inaccessible carotid lesions, carotid disruption and resultant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, unreconstructible carotid endarterectomies, and inoperable intracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relation of preoperative stump pressures to safety of ligation was evaluated. the data reflect that a systolic stump pressure in excess of 70 mm Hg (13 patients) indicates adequacy of collateral hemispheric blood flow to allow safe ligation of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pressures of 55 mm Hg or less constitute an unacceptable vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (two of three patients), and intermediate pressures of 55 to 68 mm Hg constitute a genuine hazard (four of eight patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> appear to be thromboembolic with late propagation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> into an intracranial low-flow system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postligation maintenance of appropriate systemic blood pressure is essential, and systemic heparinization is recommended to reduce the morbidity and mortality in patients in the intermediate pressure zone (55 to 68 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that whenever carotid ligation becomes a therapeutic consideration, the preoperative or preligation measurement of carotid stump pressure is presently the most reliable determinant of safety of the operation </plain></SENT>
