<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) underwent intraventricular thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>External ventricular drainage was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients within 24 hours of haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolytic therapy was started within 24 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms in ten cases, and in two further cases after 48 hours and 5 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two to 5 mg of rtPA were injected via the ventricular catheter into one or both lateral ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The injection was repeated at intervals ranging from 6 to 24 hours until CT scans demonstrated a substantial reduction of intraventricular blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total rtPA doses per patient ranged from 3 to 31 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT scans showed a marked reduction of intraventricular blood and normalization of ventricular size within 24 to 48 hours from the beginning of the fibrinolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rapid reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> by continuous diversion of cerebrospinal fluid could be achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, because the ventricular catheters never became obstructed by clotted blood during the fibrinolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the period of treatment, the level of consciousness, as classified according to the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale, improved from a mean value of 7 to 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One fatal case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> most probably due to the ventriculostomy was the only complication related to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This method of treatment might improve the prognosis in patients in whom a large intraventricular haematoma volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo>, and impaired cerebrospinal fluid circulation are major determinants for the outcome </plain></SENT>
