<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diagnosis and successful therapy before rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> would be most desirable in view of the high mortality and morbidity rates of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using transcranial color-coded duplex sonography, we studied radiologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> to define ultrasonographic criteria and sensitivity for their diagnosis and detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive patients with 30 radiologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> were prospectively examined using transcranial color-coded duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sonographer was aware of cerebral computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings but was blinded to the results of cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ultrasonographic findings for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> studied were as follows: (1) Scanning planes that transsected approximately mid-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> showed a round or oval mass that was divided by a "separation zone" into red and blue areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) The "separation zone" was characterized by dark or no colors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) Peripheral scanning planes showed monochromatic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(4) No turbulence was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(5) No spontaneous fluctuations were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of 27 (85%) nonthrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with a diameter of 6 to 25 mm were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The walls and three thrombosed and four nonthrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (mean diameter, 5 mm) were missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial color-coded duplex sonography can provide the diagnosis of nonthrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> using the above-cited criteria because of its capacity to reveal flow phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is not the method of choice in the search for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> because small and thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Careful visual inspection of the intracranial arteries to permit incidental detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> should be part of every transcranial color-coded duplex examination </plain></SENT>
