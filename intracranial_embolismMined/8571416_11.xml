<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The evaluation of cerebrovascular end points in prospective studies is often based exclusively on medical record examination and may be made by more than one observer over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address the issues of adequacy of medical record information and consistency in diagnosis over time, we evaluated interobserver agreement for the main items of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> classification system used in the Physicians' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This trial included 22,071 physicians randomly assigned in 1982 to receive either aspirin or placebo to assess the subsequent risk of cardiovascular events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtype, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, and certainty of diagnosis were first classified from medical records from the years 1982 through 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 216 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events reported in this period were independently reclassified in 1994 and compared with the initial classification using kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall agreement in major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types (hemorrhagic, ischemic, undetermined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) as well as in hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes was excellent (kappa = 0.81 and kappa = 0.95, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A wide range of values for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes (kappa = 0.13 to kappa = 0.96) was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Agreement was substantial in assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity (kappa = 0.71), and it was fair (kappa = 0.33) for certainty of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interobserver agreement is high for major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types as well as for categories of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the basis of review of medical records and results of imaging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, however, is subject to substantial interobserver disagreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Periodic reclassification of random samples of end points might be considered in long-term prospective studies to assess potential misclassification of events by different observers </plain></SENT>
