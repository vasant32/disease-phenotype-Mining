<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most complete characteristics of changes and therapeutic effectiveness in patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> may be received only from survival coefficient of patients, homogenous according to the main <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, character of disturbed cerebral circulation, age and sex of the patients </plain></SENT>
