<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several types of cerebral (embolic) protection devices have been used in patients undergoing carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed results achieved with a flow-reversal system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Carotid stenting was performed in 56 patients (mean age, 68 +/- 9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean percentage of stenosis was 77%+/- 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the procedure, cerebral protection was achieved by means of balloon occlusion of the common and external carotid artery with use of a Parodi Anti-Emboli System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' neurologic status was assessed during the intervention; at discharge; 1, 6, and 12 months after the procedure; and yearly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedure was technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 6 hours after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During long-term follow-up (to 40 months), 2 patients died of a secondary complication after <z:mp ids='MP_0001916'>intracerebral bleeding</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 1 died as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Restenosis did not exceed 50% of vessel diameter in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> results indicate that proximal occlusion and flow reversal for cerebral protection during carotid stenting is a safe and effective method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The low restenosis and complication rate during long-term follow-up is in accordance with other series of carotid angioplasty and shows that the occlusion balloons do not cause any long-term side effects </plain></SENT>
