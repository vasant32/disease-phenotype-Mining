<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have investigated the predictive value of clinical and morphologic parameters for distal embolization during carotid interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The composition of the atherosclerotic plaque, using virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) imaging obtained with an IVUS catheter that is advanced through the lesion after a filter has been placed distally, has not been evaluated as a marker for cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between atherosclerotic plaque composition determined with VH-IVUS and the occurrence of cerebral embolization after carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 10-month period, 24 patients undergoing CAS procedures using a filter device for embolic protection were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent VH-IVUS exams at the time of the intervention, transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring during CAS, and pre- and 24-hour postprocedural diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) exams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using VH-IVUS, plaque components were characterized as fibrotic, fibrofatty, dense calcium, and necrotic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of Doppler-detected microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) during CAS and the incidence and location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postprocedural embolic lesions detected with DW-MRI were assessed to determine cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and correlation analyses were used to assess the association between plaque composition and frequency of cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (71%) demonstrated new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in DW-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> revealed ipsilateral lesions and 12 (50%) had contralateral lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the entire study group, the median number of ipsilateral DW-MRI lesions was 1 (range, 0 to 3), and TCD <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts were 227 (interquartile range, 143-315) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Volumetric VH-IVUS analysis revealed that there was a trend for larger median dense calcium volume in patients with ipsilateral subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> detected with DW-MRI (33.2±24.5 mm3 vs 11.4±6.1 mm3; P=.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Scatter plots of plaque components revealed statistically significant correlation between fibrofatty plaque volume (Spearman r=0.49; P=.016) and number of new ipsilateral lesions in DW-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Degree of cerebral embolization during CAS measured with TCD correlated with plaque burden, necrotic core, fibrofatty, and fibrous volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plaque composition, as determined by VH-IVUS, only weakly correlates with the degree of cerebral embolization after carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Specifically, there is a trend for larger dense calcium volume in patients with distal embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Of note, the proportion of necrotic core, which has traditionally been considered the main component of a vulnerable or unstable plaque, is not definitely associated with subclinical cerebral embolization after CAS when a filter device for embolic protection is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The role of VH-IVUS in evaluating plaque composition during CAS remains unestablished and warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
