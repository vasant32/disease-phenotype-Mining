<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Vascular surgeons have increasingly become proficient in carotid artery stenting (CAS) as an alternative treatment modality for cervical carotid artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed our early and late outcomes of CAS over the last 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report a single-center retrospective review of 388 carotid bifurcation lesions treated with CAS using cerebral embolic protection from May 2001 to July 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data analysis includes demographics, procedural records, duplex exams, arteriograms, and two-view plain radiographs over a mean follow-up time of 23.0 months (interquartile range, 10.9-35.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the time of treatment, the mean age of the entire cohort (76% men and 24% women) is 71 years; 13% were &gt;/=80 years of age, and 31% had a prior history of either carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and/or external beam neck irradiation (XRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is 80%, and asymptomatic lesions represent 69% of the group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall 30-day rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> are 0.5%, 1.8%, and 0.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate at 30 days is 2.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day major/minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates for analyzed subgroups are statistically significant only for XRT/recurrent stenosis vs de novo lesions, 0% and 2.6% (P = .03), but not for asymptomatic vs symptomatic patients, 1.9% and 1.7% (P = .91) and age &lt;80 vs &gt;/=80, 2.0% and 1.8% (P = .52), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At long-term, the freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months was 99.2%, 97.6%, 96.7%, and 96.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At late follow-up, the restenosis rate is 3.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Restenosis rates for recurrent stenosis/XRT vs de novo lesions are 2.7% and 3.4% (P = .39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the restenotic lesions were two associated type III stent fractures in de novo lesions, both of which were closed-cell stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An additional two other type I fractures have been identified, yielding a stent fracture rate of 5.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate for the entire group is 16.8%, with one stent-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> secondary to ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 20 months (0.3% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vascular surgeons performing CAS with embolic protection can achieve good early and late outcomes that are comparable to CEA benchmarks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Late stent failures (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, restenosis, and/or stent <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>), while uncommon, are a recognized delayed problem </plain></SENT>
