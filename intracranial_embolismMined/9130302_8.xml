<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cognitive effects of photothrombotic lesions centred at two different positions were assessed in rats using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test for spatial learning and memory, and it was demonstrated that profound deficits in acquisition of this task were produced by bilateral lesions of the frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These effects were in the absence of overt motor deficits, and there was no significant correlation between lesion volume and functional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flunarizine (2 mg/kg) did not attenuate this ischaemic damage and had no effect on the functional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This model has distinct advantages over more invasive global models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and may also provide greater understanding of the functional role of the mammalian neocortex </plain></SENT>
