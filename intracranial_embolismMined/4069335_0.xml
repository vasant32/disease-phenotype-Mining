<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, two patients with a symptomatic severe basilar artery occlusive lesion showed substantial angiographic improvement after 3 months of anticoagulation in one case and 4 months after superficial temporal artery to superior cerebellar artery bypass in the other case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings in these cases indicate that clinical improvement in similar cases may reflect recanalization of a basilar artery occlusive lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The uncertain natural history and potential for regression of symptomatic basilar artery atherothrombosis make us hesitant to recommend posterior circulation revascularization immediately after such lesions are first demonstrated angiographically </plain></SENT>
