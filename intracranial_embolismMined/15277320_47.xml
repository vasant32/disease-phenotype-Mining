<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has recently emerged as a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral embolization is the most devastating complication of CAS, and the echogenicity of carotid plaque has been indicated as one of the risk factors involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to analyze the role of a computer-assisted highly reproducible index of echogenicity, namely the gray-scale median (GSM), on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Imaging in Carotid Angioplasty and Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (ICAROS) registry included 418 cases of CAS collected from 11 international centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An echographic evaluation of carotid plaque with GSM measurement was made preprocedurally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological deficits during the procedure and the postprocedural period was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of neurological complications was 3.6%: minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 2.2%, and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 11 of 155 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (7.1%) in patients with GSM &lt; or =25 and 4 of 263 (1.5%) in patients with GSM &gt;25 (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe stenosis (&gt; or =85%) had a higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of brain protection devices was confirmed in those with GSM &gt;25 (P=0.01) but not in those with GSM &lt; or =25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that GSM (OR, 7.11; P=0.002) and rate of stenosis (OR, 5.76; P=0.010) are independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid plaque echolucency, as measured by GSM &lt; or =25, increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of echolucency measured as GSM in the planning of any endovascular procedure of carotid lesions allows stratification of patients at different risks of complications in CAS </plain></SENT>
