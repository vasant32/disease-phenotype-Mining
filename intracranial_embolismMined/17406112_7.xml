<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated the reproducibility of contrast transcranial Doppler (TCD), a safe non-invasive test for investigation of venous-to-arterial circulation shunts (v-aCS), usually <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, in young <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether microbubble contrast was reproducible and whether the addition of blood to agitated saline contrast affected the number of microbubbles produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TCD investigation for v-aCS was repeated in 42 patients using a standardised protocol (i) by the same investigator and (ii) by a different investigator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Agitated saline was produced by mixing saline and 1 ml of air between two 10-ml syringes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of adding blood and increasing the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitations</z:hpo> was evaluated by microscopy examination using a haemocytometer to assess bubble numbers and sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TCD: no difference was found in the highest microbubble count for the same investigator and between different investigators (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility for the detection of v-aCS consistent with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> was also good (kappa values &gt;0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrast: both the number of contrast mixes before injection and the presence of blood significantly increased the number of bubbles counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On average, 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitations</z:hpo> produced 1.86 (95% CI 1.62-2.13) times more bubbles than 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mixtures with blood produced on average 3.8 times more bubbles (3.08-4.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The size of the bubbles was similar for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mixtures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contrast TCD is reproducible and reliable for the detection of v-aCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The addition of blood and 18 mixes rather than 6 significantly increased the number of microbubbles produced and may increase the effectiveness of microbubble contrast </plain></SENT>
