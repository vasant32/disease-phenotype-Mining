<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present studies were undertaken to examine: (1) whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic infarction</z:e> of the vibrissal cortical barrel-fields of the primary somatosensory cortex would produce behavioral consequences reflecting a sensory-motor deficit; and (2) whether there was any recovery of function up to two months after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, in two different learning tasks requiring sensory-motor integration, rats were trained to perform a motor response consequent to the detection of vibrissal cues derived from either active exploration or from passive detection of vibrissal deflection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Once training was complete, unilateral, bilateral or sham-infarction restricted to the region of the primary somatosensory cortex was produced by a non-invasive photochemical technique, which induces platelet-activated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> combined with blood-brain barrier changes and subsequent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that, regardless of the active or passive sensory characteristics of the task, unilateral and bilateral infarction resulted in a reliable performance deficit, which was not present in sham-operated control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> disrupted the ability to integrate passively received or actively acquired vibrissal sensory information with a previously associated motor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, unlike the bilaterally infarcted animals, who displayed no recovery of performance level throughout the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> testing sessions, the unilaterally infarcted animals exhibited a gradual improvement in performance beginning in the second or third week <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> and recovering to within 10-20% of preinfarction levels between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> days 46-61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The similarity of the temporal pattern of behavioral recovery in the unilateral groups, despite large differences in the sensory-motor demands of the two tasks, may reflect several common underlying mechanisms of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since similar sensory-motor behavioral deficits and recovery have been described with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the present model incorporates many of the pathophysiological and behavioral properties present in the clinical situation and may be useful for future investigation of therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
