<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound (US) is widely used to detect cerebral embolisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A drawback of the technique is that it is difficult to distinguish between small gaseous emboli and large solid emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One potential solution is to make measurements from blood and emboli at two different frequencies, because the frequency-dependence of ultrasonic backscatter will be different for the two types of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, it is not possible to produce two identical sample volumes at two different frequencies, and this will introduce an uncertainty into any such measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental measurements have been made of US fields distorted by temporal bone at 2.0 MHz and 2.5 MHz, and a mathematical model has been developed to examine the uncertainty introduced by the different field shapes at these frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the uncertainties are sufficiently large (on the order of 2 to 4 dB) that a significant percentage of emboli are likely to be misclassified by the dual-frequency method </plain></SENT>
