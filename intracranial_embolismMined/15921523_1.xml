<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No such case has been reported in persons with a history of rectal foreign body insertion despite its potential for greater trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old male was admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> and inability to speak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His past history was notable for hospitalization to extract a retained plastic soda bottle from the rectosigmoid two years prior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On examination, he was febrile, tachycardic and hypotensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an apical pansystolic murmur on cardiac examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He had a mixed receptive and expressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, and a right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On rectal examination he had perianal <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> and diminished sphincter tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed infarction of the occipital and frontal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal Echocardiography of the heart revealed vegetations on the mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of his blood culture bottles grew <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6827">methicillin</z:chebi> sensitive Staphylococcus aureus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>He was successfully treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7447">nafcillin</z:chebi> and gentamicin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rectum is frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus and trauma to its mucosa can lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> with this organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the absence of corroborative evidence such as presented here, it is difficult to make a correlation between staphylococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and anorectal foreign body insertion due to patients being less than forthcoming CONCLUSION: There is a potential risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919861" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">staphylococcal bacteremia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> with rectal foreign body insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to explore this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Detailed sexual history and patient counseling should be made a part of routine primary care </plain></SENT>
