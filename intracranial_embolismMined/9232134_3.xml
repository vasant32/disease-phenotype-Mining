<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine whether the laser pulse resulted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and to examine changes in middle cerebral artery flow velocity and jugular bulb oxygen saturation (SjO2) during transmyocardial laser revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status III) were studied after the authors received institutional review board approval and the patients' informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monitored variables included mean arterial blood pressure (measured in millimeters of mercury), heart rate (measured as beats/min), and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (measured in millimeters of mercury) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 5-MHz transesophageal-sonography system was used to record intraventricular events after laser injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean blood flow velocity (Vmean; measured in centimeters per second) was monitored in the middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler sonography, and SjO2 (expressed as a percentage) was measured using a fiberoptic thermodilution catheter placed in the right jugular bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were recorded before, during, and for 4 min after laser injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After laser injection, intraventricular echogenic contrast was seen in transesophageal-sonography, and 2-4 s later high-intensity signals (microemboli) appeared in the transcranial Doppler sonography spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As long as mean arterial pressure remained stable during the observation period, Vmean and SjO2 did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that microemboli can be detected after laser injection in the middle cerebral artery, although they do not effect Vmean and SjO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that these microemboli do not induce a global oxygen imbalance </plain></SENT>
