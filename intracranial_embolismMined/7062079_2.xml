<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the vertebral artery was observed after a short delay in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the carotid arteries were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the controlateral vertebral artery was dominant, an embolic mechanism was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No new event occurred in the following one and three years respectively after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two cases demonstrate the possibility of embolism from severe stenosis of the cervical vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mechanism could explain some of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> related to vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
