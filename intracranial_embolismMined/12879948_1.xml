<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp) is an important pathogen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> of the respiratory tract; recently, also a number of reports suggesting its relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to clarify the relation between Cp <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Forty elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (age 75 +/- 6.6; male 57.5%) and 85 elderly control subjects without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (age 74 +/- 8.1; male 43.5%) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were divided into four groups according to clinical diagnosis: 1) atherothrombotic infarction, 2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, 3) those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e>, and 4) non-classifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cp <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was determined by measuring the anti-Cp IgG specific antibody level (Cp IgG index) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those below the 1.10 Cp IgG index were determined as seronegative and those above 1.10 as seropositive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 20 cases (87.0%) of atherothrombotic infarction, 6 (66.7%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, 3 (50.0%) others and 52 (61.2%) control were Cp seropositive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cp seropositiveness, as adjusted by multiple regression analysis using various known risk factors, was a significant independent contributing factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (p = 0.017) and was associated with an increased risk for atherothrombotic infarction (odds ratio, 12.6; 95% CI, 2.0-79.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This suggests that Cp <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is also an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, particularly atherothrombotic infarction in elderly Japanese </plain></SENT>
