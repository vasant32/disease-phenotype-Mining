<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the effect of poststenotic low blood flow in patients with recently symptomatic severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> on arterio-arterial embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Analyses based on a series of 206 consecutive patients (155 men and 51 women, mean age 65.3 years) with a nondisabling ischemic event in the anterior circulation &lt; or =30 days (median 4.5) before presentation and diagnosis of ipsilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>/occlusion (&gt; or =30% local diameter reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent Doppler/duplex sonography, which included measurement of poststenotic flow velocity as an indicator for poststenotic blood flow as well as a 1-hour transcranial Doppler monitoring for the detection of embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven of two hundred and six patients had very severe stenosis which was associated with reduced poststenotic flow velocity (&lt;20 cm/s systolic) in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probability of embolic signals increased with increasing degree of stenosis and was maximal in patients with stenoses &gt; or =90% local diameter reduction if poststenotic flow velocity was not reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced poststenotic flow velocity in patients with very severe stenosis was associated with a significantly lower frequency of embolic signals compared to patients with the same degree of stenosis but no velocity reduction (adjusted odds ratio 0.15, 95% confidence interval 0.025-0.897, p = 0.038, adjustment for antiplatelet medication and time since <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low poststenotic flow velocity behind very severe internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> reduces the otherwise high frequency of embolic signals in recently symptomatic patients corroborating the hypothesis that reduced blood flow across <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> causes reduced embolism </plain></SENT>
