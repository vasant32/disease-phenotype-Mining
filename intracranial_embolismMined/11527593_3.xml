<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to develop an automatic system that could replace the HE and, thus, make the technique more widely applicable and, potentially, more reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An expert system, based around a digital signal-processing board, analysed Doppler signal patterns in both the time domain and frequency domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The system was trained and tested on Doppler signals recorded during the dissection and recovery phases of carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was tested with 74 separate 2.5-min recordings that contained at least 575 artefacts in addition to 253 s of diathermy interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with the results obtained by three HEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a "gold-standard" that classified any event detected by the majority of HEs as an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, the automatic system displayed a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 95.1% for 1151 candidate events 7 dB or more above the clutter (signal-to-clutter ratio, SCR, &gt; or = 7 dB), and 89.6% and 95.3%, respectively, for 2098 candidate events with SCR &gt; or = 5 dB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The system had a very similar performance to individual HEs for SCR &gt; or = 7dB, and was only marginally worse for SCR &gt; or = 5 dB </plain></SENT>
