<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These studies showed that cortical waves of SD, arising spontaneously during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and promoted the establishment of a collateral blood supply in the perifocal zone of ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanism consisted of episodes of intense vasodilation at the decay phase of every wave of SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Respiration of 0.8% CO increased the blood carboxyhemoglobin level to 50-60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In lightly anesthetized rats (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> 20 mg/kg), cortical and subcortical spontaneous waves of SD were transformed into stable hypoxic depolarization, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 60% of the animals or severe lesions of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, in 20% of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increases in the level of anesthesia (50 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi>) prevented the spontaneous appearance of SD during long-lasting exposure to CO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these conditions, experimentally induced waves of SD demonstrated that the hippocampus has a high sensitivity to moderate levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The duration of hypoxic depolarization of the hippocampus, provoking a single SD wave, reached 30-60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Selective neuron damage in field CA1 was seen 30 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the left hippocampus of rats frequently showed profound morphological lesions in the form of "granules." Cerebrolysine (2.5 ml/kg daily for 10 days) completely prevented the formation of these lesions </plain></SENT>
