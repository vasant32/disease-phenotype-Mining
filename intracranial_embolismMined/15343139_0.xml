<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of carotid artery stenting with filter device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May 2001 and July 2002, a total of 96 consecutive patients (100 lesions) who presented with symptomatic &gt;70% diameter stenosis, asymptomatic &gt;90% diameter stenosis or post-endarterectomy as well as post-radiotherapy hemodynamically significant stenosis underwent carotid artery stenting with filter protection at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 72 (range 51-91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 22 female (23%), and 74 male (77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 96 patients, 62 patients (65%) did not filled the NASCET surgical criteria and 24 (26%) were classified as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent pretreatment with antiplatelet agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were performed with a standardized monitoring system by a multidisciplinary team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Filtration system for cerebral protection was consistently used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were procedural atheroembolic events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates up to 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A protection system type "TRAP" (Microvena, Italy) or a protection system type "EPIFILTER" (Boston Scientific, USA) were employed in 28% and 67% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 5% it was not possible to cross the stenosis with the filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The stent placement was achieved in 95 of the procedures (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 86% of cases a primary stenting technique was performed, with balloon pre-dilation of the lesion and subsequent stent advancement through the stenosis accounting for 9% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the time of protection system removal, 21 filter (21%) showed presence of macroscopic particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We recorded 8 (8%) homolateral neurological events: two major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, one minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> fully recovered within 2 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>General complications (5%) included one lesion of the median nerve, two groin haematomas (one with disability for the patient, and one requiring surgery), one myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and one lower limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> requiring surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> major complications (4%) (two major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, one myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and one lesion of the median nerve) occurred within the first 31 cases, the 69 following procedures not showing any neurological or non-neurological major events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>At 30 days <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient were still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Filter protection during carotid artery stenting seems technically feasible as well as reasonably safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The EPIFILTER system turned out to be of easier employment due to its "monorail" system and because it does not usually need a catheter of dedicated recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Further studies in larger groups of patients are required to best characterize criteria guiding the choice for the right protection system </plain></SENT>
