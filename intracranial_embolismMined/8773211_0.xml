<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Following a cerebro-vascular accident, motor deficits are usually associated with a selective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of fast fatiguable muscle fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reduction of output torque in spastic patients is considered to be caused by unfused twitches resulting from the reduction in the motor unit firing rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To regain control of a paretic limb, these patients have to learn, through training, how to recruit an adequate number of intact motor units to generate the required functional movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, intra-subject variability makes difficult the assessment of the effects of any therapy treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our objective here was thus to address the problem of the data variability and to analyze the electromyographic signal obtained from hemiplegic patients under biofeedback training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The experimental situation chosen was a very isolated but controlled motor activity (an isometric shoulder forward flexion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that after training, 5 out of 11 patients could produce EMG signal from their affected deltoid whose mean value was 50% greater than before the training, while no appreciable change was observed for their unaffected deltoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While these EMG changes on the HEMI side are correlated with greater torque output, the coefficient of correlation is slightly smaller after than before the training (r = 0.87 vs 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can be hypothesized that while the training was directed toward the deltoid, the patients in some ways developed new strategies for contracting their shoulder </plain></SENT>
