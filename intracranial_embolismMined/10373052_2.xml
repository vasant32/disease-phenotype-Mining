<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The right hemisyndrome was most probably related to diving, since symptoms responded rapidly to the early commenced recompression therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further diagnostics revealed a previously unknown <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036205" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary sarcoidosis</z:e> with bilateral pulmonary opacities and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pleural adhesions</z:e> that might have predisposed to arterial gas embolism secondary to pulmonary barotrauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case may illustrate a potential risk of decompression illness even during dry chamber dives in patients suffering from asymptomatic pleuro-parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The value of chest X-ray in the medical assessment of fitness to dive is therefore emphasized </plain></SENT>
