<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this report is to present a single-center experience of 136 consecutive patients operated on between 1978 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The diagnosis of PHVO was mainly assessed by fluoroscopy and/or echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombosed valves were bileaflet (82), tilting disc (47) and ball cage (7) valves; of these, 90 were in mitral, 38 in aortic, six in aortic and mitral position, and two in tricuspid position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between the first implantation and valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 7.4+/-6.6 years (range 1 day to 28 years); in 37 patients preoperative medical therapy (fibrinolysis in 21, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> alone in 16) was unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative procedures included valve re-replacement in 104 cases and declotting-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155094,C0333350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">pannus</z:e> excision in 32 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early hospital mortality was 10.3% (14 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in NYHA class III or IV, and one patient suffered a perioperative cerebral embolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgery was then successful in 121 of 136 patients (89%), but during a 3.15-year follow-up, prosthetic heart valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> recurred in ten out of 122 survivors (8.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From this experience, it can be concluded that for most PHVO, early operation is currently effective and safe, especially in patients in stable hemodynamic condition preoperatively </plain></SENT>
