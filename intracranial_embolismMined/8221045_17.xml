<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fourteen symptomatic patients with severe extracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (&gt; or = 70% of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing) were monitored using long-term transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to determine the rate of clinically silent embolism of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before carotid endarterectomy (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients being treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>), 462 such events occurred during a total monitoring time of 45 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses of the inter-event intervals and of the relationship between events and cardiac cycle revealed random occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the ipsilateral events were found in each subject, silent embolism of the contralateral middle cerebral artery occurred in only four patients each of whom had angiographically proven intracranial cross-flow from the symptomatic carotid territory (39 embolic events during 7 h monitoring time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other 10 patients showed no contralateral embolism (10 h monitoring time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five or more days (median 10 days) after surgery and cessation of intravenous anticoagulation the ipsilateral event rate had dropped to 13 in 33 h (P &lt; 0.001) and the contralateral rate to zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the stenosed arterial segment is the main source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> detectable with ultrasound in symptomatic patients with high-grade internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, and that carotid endarterectomy substantially reduces the rate of these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since reduction of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk by successful endarterectomy is known to be of a similar degree in patients as those studied here, transcranially detected embolism may represent a new marker of disease activity of extracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
