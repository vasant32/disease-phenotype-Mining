<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Monitoring of carotid endarterectomy with electroencephalography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography provides instantaneous information about hemodynamic changes and embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a relation between these findings and intraoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> has not yet been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study we compared preoperative and post-operative computed tomographic scans (58 patients) or magnetic resonance imaging (40 patients) of the brain, assessed by two independent observers, to detect intraoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and we related any such new lesions to the findings of intraoperative monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the computed tomography series one intraoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> occurred, with corresponding clinical deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the magnetic resonance group four patients developed new lesions that occurred intraoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were clinically silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant relation between the number of embolic signals during the surgical dissection of the carotid artery and the occurrence of intraoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were of the lacunar type; the fourth patient had a border-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, associated not only with many embolic signals but also with low flow during cross-clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no demonstrable ultrasound side effects on brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Embolic signals detected by transcranial Doppler monitoring in the dissection phase of carotid endarterectomy show a significant relation to new ischemic lesions and therefore are potentially harmful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The phenomenon should alert the vascular surgeon </plain></SENT>
