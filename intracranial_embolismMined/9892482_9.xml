<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> following coronary artery surgery on-pump and off-pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neurological outcome was evaluated in 322 patients with a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional CPB was used (on-pump) in 305 patients and in 17 patients no CPB was used (off-pump) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively, a pulsed-wave transcranial Doppler with a 2-MHZ probe measured high-intensity transient signals (HITS) by ultrasonic insonnation of the middle cerebral artery indicating the presence of emboli within the vessel lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial near-infrared spectroscopy measured cerebral venous oxygen saturation for adequate perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were subjected to the antisaccadic eye movement (ASEM) test, a sensitive indicator of neurocognitive deficits secondary to frontal lobe dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While there was no significant difference in O2 saturation, the number of microemboli HITS generated was significantly higher in the on-pump group than the off-pump group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the off-pump group, 16 (94%) of 17 patients had perfect scores on the ASEM test, while only 108 (35.4%) of 305 patients achieved a perfect score in the on-pump group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the off-pump group achieved at least 90%, 28% (86/305) in the on-pump group scored "zero" on the ASEM test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral dysfunction</z:e> as evidenced by ASEM errors is common following coronary bypass on-pump, but rare with off-pump bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli generated during CPB may account for this difference </plain></SENT>
