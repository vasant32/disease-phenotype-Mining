<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using an activated thromboplastin time (aPTT) based method in the presence of APC together with a DNA technique based on the polymerase chain reaction, we investigated 37 children with venous (V: n=19) or arterial (A: n=18) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and 196 age-matched healthy controls for the presence of this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the control group 10 children were detected to be heterozygous for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, indicating a prevalence of 5.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>10/19 children (52%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and 7/18 (38%) patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> showed the common factor V gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited coagulation disorders</z:e> were found in 1/10 (V:10%) and 2/7 (A:28%) APC-resistant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inherited coagulation disorders</z:e> without APCR were diagnosed in 3/9 (V: 33%) and 2/11 (A:18%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we diagnosed exogenous risk factors in 6/10 (V: 60%) and 2/7 (A: 28%) children with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and APCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data are evidence that APCR combined with exogenous reasons may play an important role in the early manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> during infancy and childhood </plain></SENT>
