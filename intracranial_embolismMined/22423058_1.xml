<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is reported at an incidence up to 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging studies have identified new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinically silent ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> more frequently (68-84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So far, few data are available about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of high-intensity transient signals (HITS) and to explore differences in the HITS pattern between transfemoral and transapical access and between self-expanding (SE) and balloon-expandable (BE) deployment technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound recordings of 44 patients undergoing TAVI (age 78 ± 6 years; logistic EuroSCORE 28 ± 15%; transfemoral access, n = 32; transapical access, n = 12; SE, n = 27; BE, n = 17) were analysed for HITS during the following intervals: (i) instrumentation prior to valvuloplasty, (ii) balloon valvuloplasty, (iii) prosthesis deployment (DP) and (iv) post-implantation (PI) including any re-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total procedural load of HITS and HITS frequency in procedural intervals were compared between different access routes and DP techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural neurocognitive impairment was assessed clinically and by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> assessment method (CAM) prior to TAVI and on post-procedural days 1 and 4-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TCD recordings demonstrated the occurrence of HITS in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DP was associated with the highest load of HITS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Access route did not significantly influence the total burden of periprocedural HITS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During procedures using the SE type, a slightly larger total load of HITS was observed than with the BE type (P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This was mainly due to more HITS during the DP (P = 0.027) and the PI interval (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> was detected by CAM ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients suffered a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within the 2 weeks following the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and 30-day mortality were 0/44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HITS are observed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedural intervals in TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The embolic events appear to peak during DP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In our series, the overall cerebral embolic load did not differ between the transfemoral and the transapical access route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring in TAVI is useful to identify periods and manipulations associated with an increased cerebral embolic load and may help to further enhance the safety of this procedure </plain></SENT>
