<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Combined intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial (IA) thrombolytic therapy may be faster and easier to initiate than monotherapy, and its recanalization rate may be better as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sequential combination of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) and urokinase (UK) has synergistic and complementary effects on clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated the effectiveness and safety of sequential combination of IV rTPA and IA UK in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IV rTPA was administered to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those whose condition had not improved at the end of rTPA infusion were further treated with selective IA UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated baseline and 30-day National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores and 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients were initially treated with IV rTPA; 24 were further treated with IA UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients who had rapid reocclusion following initial successful IA therapy received IV abciximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 24 patients who underwent angiography had an effective perfusion state of Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> grade 3 flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median baseline and 30-day NIHSS scores were 18 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients improved to a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1 after 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> developed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The strategy of using conventional-dose IV rTPA and the sequential combination of IA UK in patients without an early clinical response to IV treatment was safe and feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This strategy achieved high complete arterial recanalization rates and good functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
