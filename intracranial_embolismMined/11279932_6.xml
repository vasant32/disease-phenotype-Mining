<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the high prevalence of factor V Leiden in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> has suggested an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and prothrombotic genetic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> being a multifactorial disease, the aim of this study was to test whether prothrombotic tendencies increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the prevalence of four prothrombotic genetic risk factors (factor V R/Q 506, factor II 20210 G/A, decanucleotide insertion/deletion in the factor VII promoter, and the platelet <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-1 alloantigen system) in 17 patients with coexisting ischemic cerebrovascular disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, 107 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease, 106 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, and 202 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> polymorphisms analyzed in our study were performed after specific genomic polymerase chain reaction, and confirmed by single-strain conformation polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients with coexisting ischemic cerebrovascular disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, the prevalence of prothrombotic genotypes (factor V Leiden, 5.8%; factor II 20210 A, 0%; factor VII A1, 70.6%; and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-1b, 35.3%) was similar to that obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We can conclude that the studied polymorphisms do not seem to be associated with the development of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in those patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
