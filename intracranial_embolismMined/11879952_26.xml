<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a new transcranial Doppler modality, power M-mode Doppler (PMD), for addressing these issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 2-MHz digital Doppler (Spencer Technologies TCD100M) having 33 sample gates placed with 2-mm spacing was configured to display Doppler signal power, colored red and blue for directionality, in an M-mode format </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spectrogram from a user-selected depth was displayed simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This system was then explored on healthy subjects and patients presenting with varying cerebrovascular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PMD facilitated window location and alignment of the US beam to view blood flow from multiple vessels simultaneously, without sound or spectral clues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microemboli appeared as characteristic sloping high-power tracks in the PMD image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Power M-mode Doppler is a new paradigm facilitating vessel location, diagnosis, monitoring and microembolus detection </plain></SENT>
