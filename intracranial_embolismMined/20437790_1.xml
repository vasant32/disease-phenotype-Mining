<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An increasing number of reports surrounding neurologic injury in the setting of cardiac surgery has focused on utilizing biomarkers as intermediate outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous research has associated cerebral microemboli and neurobehavioral deficits with biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A leading source of cerebral microemboli is the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This present study seeks to identify a relationship between microemboli leaving the CPB circuit and a biomarker of neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 71 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting at a single institution from October 14, 2004 through December 5, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were monitored using Power-M-Mode Doppler in the inflow and outflow of the CPB circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood was sampled before and within 48 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic injury was measured using S100beta (microg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in post-operative S100beta relative to microemboli leaving the circuit were tested with analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most patients had increased serum levels of S100beta (mean .25 microg/L, median .15 microg/L) following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Terciles of microemboli measured in the outflow (indexed to the duration of time spent on CPB) were associated with elevated levels of S100beta (p = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microemboli leaving the CPB circuit were associated with increases in postoperative S100beta levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Efforts aimed at reducing microembolic load leaving the CPB circuit should be adopted to reduce brain injury </plain></SENT>
