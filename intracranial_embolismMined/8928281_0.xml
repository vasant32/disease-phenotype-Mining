<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze age specific incidence rates (IRs) of cerebral thromboembolic attacks (CTA) among women and men 15-44 years of age in Denmark from 1980 through 1993 and quantify possible influences from oral contraceptives (OC) on the incidence figures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The discharge diagnoses <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 432-436 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Danish neurological, neurosurgical and medical departments during the period 1980-1993 were identified in a central diagnosis register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of OC was achieved from complete sale statistics during the study period and cross-sectional studies assessing the type-specific use of OC at different ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the 14-year study period, 2100 female and 2552 male attacks were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men had an exponentially increasing IR with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with men in the period 1980-1986, women had more attacks in the 20-35-year age group and fewer attacks above the age of 35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 1987 the sex differences below the age of 35 were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the first half (1980-1986) to the last half (1987-1993) of the study period, women below 30 years had a significantly falling CTA IR of -20.4%, compared with a nonsignificant fall of -9.5% among men below 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the age group above 30 years, women experienced a non significant increase of 4.2%, men a significant increase of 11.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assuming that use of OC implied an average relative risk of CTA of 2.5 and pregnancy a relative risk of 4, a correction was made for the contribution of incident cases among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The corrected IRs had a close co-variation with the IRs of men up to the age of 35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, men had higher IR as is the case for older age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that women's pregnancies and use of OC may explain the higher IRs of CTA in young fertile age compared to those of men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The more pronounced fall in IRs among young women compared with young men through the last 14 years may be a consequence of the reduced hormonal content of OC </plain></SENT>
