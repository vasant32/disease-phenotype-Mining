<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The success of local fibrinolysis in vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> depends on the volume and composition of the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since thrombolysis can also be time consuming and cause <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, we investigated the feasibility of a mechanical clot retraction device based on a nitinol basket advanced through a microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolism of the basilar artery who presented with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and impaired consciousness were included in a multicenter study (Neuronet Evaluation in Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Disease [NEED]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients flow reversal was induced with the use of <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> balloons or coaxial catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients required additional fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The device failed to retrieve the clots in our first 2 patients with distal basilar artery embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After successful recanalization by local fibrinolysis, both patients survived, 1 disabled and 1 with little residual impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the next 3 patients the anterograde flow in the basilar artery was reversed during the short retraction period by temporarily blocking the vertebral or subclavian arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of these patients were completely recanalized by solely mechanical means; the third patient needed additional fibrinolysis before also being recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients survived: 1 remained disabled, 1 had almost a full recovery, and 1 became asymptomatic the day after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> extraction seems to be a feasible method for preventing infarction by rapid, complete, and safe recanalization of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend the use of flow control to support retrieval of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (which the proximal flow would otherwise keep in place like a cork) and to protect the distal vessels from embolization by fragments </plain></SENT>
