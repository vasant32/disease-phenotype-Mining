<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasonography can be used to detect the presence of emboli in the cerebral arterial circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emboli can be produced by different sources and can be of different nature: solid elements as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, platelet aggregates or atheromatous material, or gaseous when they are produced during the decompression phase of diving or during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A more recent source of emboli has been found in the mechanical prostheic heart valves (MHV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The emboli generated by MHV are likely of gaseous nature and are found in the middle cerebral artery blood flow at a variable rate, where they are detected by transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of production of these microbubbles may be related to the rapid leaflet motion especially at closure when very high local pressure gradients appear, which may be able to provoke a release of the disolved blood gas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Solid element emboli constitute a major cause of cerebrovascular disease and particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, gaseous emboli coming from ECC or MHV are considered as clinically silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive alterations</z:e> have been reported after ECC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As the MHV carriers are chronically submitted to embolic events, it can be assumed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> may occur also in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A preliminary study was designed to inpatients attention and memory in patients with normally functioning MHV and microemboli, with biological prosthesis and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the two groups of patients, episodic memory was significantly altered relatively to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the MHV carriers group, a significant decrease in working memory performance was observed relatively to the two other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results confirm a long term effect of the microembolization occuring during ECC and point out the effect of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposition to microemboli </plain></SENT>
