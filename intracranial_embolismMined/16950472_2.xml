<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the presence of potential aortic or cardiac sources of embolism in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in one or more vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, involvement of multiple vascular territories has been used to implicate a cardiac or aortic source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether patients with multivessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have a higher frequency of cardiac or aortic embolic sources on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) compared with patients with single-territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 210 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> documented by neuroimaging undergoing TEE for identification of a potential embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 3 groups (lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/single-vessel involvement, nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/multivessel involvement) and the frequency of potential embolic sources on TEE was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 210 patients, 121 (58%) were male and the mean age was 61 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 139 patients (66%) were classified as having single-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 47 (22%) as having multivessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 24 (11%) as having lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On TEE, 87 patients (41%) had at least one potential source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with multivessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had fewer potential embolic sources on TEE than patients with single-vessel or lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (26% vs 46% and 46%, respectively; P = .043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the incidence of a potential cardiac or aortic source of embolism is high, regardless of the vascular distribution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TEE may be a useful tool to assess the source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in single-vessel, multivessel, and lacunar territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the presence of potential aortic or cardiac sources of embolism in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in one or more vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A total of 210 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were divided into 3 groups (lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/single-vessel involvement, nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/multivessel involvement) and the frequency of potential embolic sources on transesophageal echocardiography was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with multivessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had fewer potential embolic sources on transesophageal echocardiography than patients with single-vessel or lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, but the frequency of a potential cardiac or aortic source of embolism was high, regardless of the vascular distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
