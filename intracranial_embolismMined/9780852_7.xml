<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may improve the often elusive diagnosis of CVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the sensitivity, specificity, and full spectrum of such MRI findings are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors present the cases of three patients with CVI whose MRI scans showed abnormally enhancing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the CVIs were hemorrhagic and exerted mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient showed increasingly nodular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> ring-like enhancement progressing from the single-dose to the triple-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> contrast images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CVI of a second patient also showed ring-like enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsy was performed on one of these patients and was strongly considered for the other two patients to exclude <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Careful examination of the MRI appearance of venous structures and the use of specialized MRI techniques improved the recognition of CVI for two patients and prevented biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This represents the first description of abnormal triple-dose MRI contrast enhancement in CVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consideration of CVI in the care of patients with enhancing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-like masses may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment, preventing unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CVI should be added to the differential diagnosis of supratentorial ring-enhancing masses </plain></SENT>
