<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters that can identify as well as predict disruption of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats subjected to embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with (n=13) and without (n=13) rt-PA treatment were followed with MRI using quantitative permeability-related parameters, consisting of: transfer constant (K(i)) of Gd- <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>, the distribution volume (V(p)) of the mobile protons, and the inverse of the apparent forward transfer rate for magnetization transfer (k(inv)), as well as the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(w)), T2, and cerebral cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue progressing to fibrin leakage resulting from <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption and adjacent tissue were then analyzed to identify MRI markers that characterize <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were killed after final MRI measurements at 24 h after induction of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and cerebral tissues were perfused and stained to detect fibrin leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>K(i), V(p), and k(inv) were the most sensitive early (2 to 3 h) indices of the cerebral tissue that progresses to fibrin leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was not significantly different between ischemic tissue with a compromised and an intact <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that compromise of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> can be sensitively predicted using a select set of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> parameters </plain></SENT>
