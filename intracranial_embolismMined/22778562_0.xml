<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Device- or technique-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is a drawback of various neuro-endovascular procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detachable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> embolization coils can be sources of such air bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed the formation of air bubbles during in vitro delivery of various detachable coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A closed circuit simulating a typical endovascular coiling procedure was primed with saline solution degassed by a sonification device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty commercially available detachable coils (7 Axium, 4 GDCs, 5 MicroPlex, 7 Target, and 7 Trufill coils) were tested by using the standard coil flushing and delivery techniques suggested by each manufacturer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The emergence of any air bubbles was monitored with a digital microscope and the images were captured to measure total volumes of air bubbles during coil insertion and detachment and after coil pusher removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Air bubbles were seen during insertion or removal of 23 of 30 coils (76.7%), with volumes ranging from 0 to 23.42 mm(3) (median: 0.16 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Air bubbles were observed most frequently after removal of the coil pusher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly larger amounts of air bubbles were observed in Target coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Variable volumes of air bubbles are observed while delivering detachable embolization coils, particularly after removal of the coil pusher and especially with Target coils </plain></SENT>
