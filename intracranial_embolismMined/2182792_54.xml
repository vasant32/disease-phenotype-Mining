<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell-free subarachnoid clots of autologous plasma in the basal cistern were found to produce no significant reaction of the basilar artery, while whole-blood clots induced a small (15%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> constriction after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the plasma clots were not well retained in the basal cistern, however, small beads (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> or latex) were added to stabilize them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Injection of beads and plasma led to moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vasoconstriction (35% to 40%) with rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control experiments demonstrated that these foreign bodies (beads) alone induced this vascular reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination showed that severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> followed the introduction of subarachnoid beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The experiments demonstrate that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> alone, in the absence of other processes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, may induce persistent and severe cerebroarterial constriction and raises the possibility that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in response to subarachnoid blood may play a role in clinical vasospasm </plain></SENT>
