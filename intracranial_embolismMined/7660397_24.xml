<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the causes of morbidity and mortality after surgery for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred thirty consecutive patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volume and vasospasm were evaluated preoperatively with CT, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine infusion was started before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative clinical status was evaluated according to Hunt and Hess grading criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed early in 186 patients (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control angiography, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and CT were performed routinely after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypodense areas revealed by control CT were related to intracerebral initial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, vasospasm, postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, or spatula hyperpressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical outcome was excellent or good (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] scores of 1 or 2) in 176 patients (77%), 17 (7%) were disabled (GOS score of 3), and 37 (16%) were vegetative or dead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients in good condition (grades I to III) preoperatively (n = 200), 38 had an unfavorable outcome (GOS score of 2, 3, 4, or 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The major cause of complication was postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients in poor condition (grade IV or V) (n = 30), 27 had an unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The major cause of complication was initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was responsible for delayed ischemic deficit in 9 patients (3.9% of the total population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systematic angiography remains by far the best means for determining the cause of a poor postoperative course </plain></SENT>
