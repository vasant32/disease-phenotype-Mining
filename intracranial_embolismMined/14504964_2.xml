<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinically silent circulating microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) can be identified by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not yet clear whether their occurrence is always linked to the presence of embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 24 terminally ill patients (7 women, 17 men; mean age 68 years) were investigated by TCD of the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings were correlated with a complete post-mortem examination of potential embolic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients out of the 24 under investigation showed <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, 2 of them bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these 4 MES-positive patients had a definite embolic source, i. e. bilateral carotid artery occlusive disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> with thrombotic valvular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> and severe plaques in the aortic arch, <z:mp ids='MP_0004063'>dilated left atrium</z:mp> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, or severe plaques in the aortic arch and a <z:mp ids='MP_0004063'>dilated left atrium</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the investigated patient group, we could demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> can only be found when an embolic source is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> justifies an extensive clinical and laboratory search for potential embolic sources including extracranial and intracranial colour-coded duplex ultrasound, ECG, Holter-ECG, and TEE </plain></SENT>
