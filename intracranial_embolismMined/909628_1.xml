<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The angiographic appearance of twenty-seven unilateral or bilateral occlusions of the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are classified into proximal, interpeduncular, ambient or distal occlusions according to their prefered location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ambient occlusions were by far the most common and have therefore probably not developed from a stenosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> since this forms preferentially in the proximal and interpeduncular segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leptomeningeal anastomoses were common between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> respective branches of the middle cerebral artery and the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> but the anterior cerebral artery and the interarterial anastomoses rarely contributed to the collateral blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A retrograde progression of the occlusion was observed on reangiography occasionally in cases in which there was no major artery originating just proximal to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anterograde progression and disintegration of obstructing material was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusions had a good prognosis in terms of survival but the associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> rarely improved </plain></SENT>
