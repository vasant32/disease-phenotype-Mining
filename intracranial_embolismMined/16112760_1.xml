<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is most often performed during a short hospital stay or in an outpatient setting of a hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective analysis, we report our experience on electrical cardioversions in private practice without a hospital stand-by performed by a cardiologist and an anesthesiologist in concert </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients with a mean age of 66+/-8 years and a typical spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> in stable condition were chosen for the ambulatory procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immediate success rate of electrical cardioversion was 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the next 3 months, a relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> occurred in 46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following 87 procedures in 60 patients, 3 complications requiring a hospital admission occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these three patients had suffered from a short <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> without other deficits potentially due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apart from these complications, no patient suffered a thromboembolic complication or a cerebral problem following electrical cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that elective electrical cardioversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> can be performed safely, effectively and comfortable for patient and physician following a preceding evaluation and counseling by a cardiac specialist </plain></SENT>
