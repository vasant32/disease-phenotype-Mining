<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if there was a persistent effect after treatment, by testing spatial learning of embolized rats after nefiracetam therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats (250 to 300 g) were divided into 3 categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group (n = 5) underwent no surgery or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vehicle group (n = 12) was anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>, underwent surgery, injected with intracarotid microspheres, and given orally 5 mL/kg of the vehicle (0.5% aqueous <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> carboxymethyl cellulose) for 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nefiracetam group (n = 12) was embolized and treated orally with 30 mg/kg nefiracetam (6 mg/mL in vehicle) for 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was determined with visual spatial learning after the end of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Embolization caused a significant impairment in visual spatial learning, which nefiracetam completely ameliorated (group main effect, F(2,444) = 6.4, P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean latency to the escape was 35 +/- 6 seconds for the vehicle group versus 18 +/- 4 seconds for the nefiracetam group, after 4 days of testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect persisted after a further interval of 10 days (retention test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A reversal test (to assess working memory for new information) yielded mean latencies of 26 +/- 6 seconds for the control group, 49 +/- 5 seconds for vehicle, and 25 +/- 4 seconds for nefiracetam (group main effect, F(2,109) = 8.0, P = .0005, Newman-Keuls, P &lt; .05), showing that both the control and nefiracetam groups were different from the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nefiracetam therapy improves the learning behavior of embolized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results are not caused by an activating effect of the drug because the animals are tested after the treatment period is over and because the beneficial effect is seen using the delayed retention test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, working memory is markedly preserved by nefiracetam, an effect observed several weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>
