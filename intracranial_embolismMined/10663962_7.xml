<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolization with fibrin-rich clot material (0.28-microl clot volume) led to an LDF decline to about 20-30% of baseline in untreated mice, which resulted in reproducible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory (122.8 +/- 29.4 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Administration of rt-PA (10 mg/kg) 15 min after clot injection induced a progressive LDF restoration to approximately 115% of control values after 2 h, and brought about a significant reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (62.3 +/- 42.4 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that ischemic injury may be significantly attenuated by intracarotid thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, injury is not completely reversed, even if reperfusion is initiated as early as 15 min after embolization </plain></SENT>
