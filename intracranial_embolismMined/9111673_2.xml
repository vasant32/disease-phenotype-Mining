<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> classified as embolic or hemodynamic by their appearance on CT scans reflect distinct pathophysiologic entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarctions</z:e> were retrospectively classified into two groups according to their morphologic appearance on CT scans: territorial infarctions and watershed, or terminal supply area, infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity for both groups of patients was determined with the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 method and 32 stationary detectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients with unilateral, supratentorial, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262005" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemic cerebral infarctions</z:e> were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT findings were highly suggestive of a territorial infarction in 14 patients (mean age, 56 years) and of a watershed infarction in seven patients (mean age, 52 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The initial slope index of the territorial and watershed infarction groups during <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation was 55.1 +/- 2.4 sec-1 and 52.0 +/- 1.9 sec-1, respectively, in the infarcted hemispheres and 58.3 +/- 2.3 sec-1 and 55.1 +/- 1.5 sec-1, respectively, in the noninfarcted hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity of the unaffected detectors was 1.75 +/- 0.3 sec-1 mm Hg-1 and 1.51 +/- 0.2 sec-1 mm Hg-1 for the territorial and watershed infarction groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity of the affected detectors was 1.75 +/- 0.3 sec-1 mm Hg-1 and 1.27 +/- 0.2 sec-1 mm Hg-1 for the two groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity difference between affected detectors of the hemodynamic group and age-matched healthy control subjects was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The difference in <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity between the two groups supports the concept that CT criteria can identify two pathophysiologic entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we conclude that during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage, lower <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity of the watershed infarction indicates that the global hemodynamic situation in these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is more severely compromised than in territorial infarctions </plain></SENT>
