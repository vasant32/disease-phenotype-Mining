<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hypotheses that cerebral embolic events lead to repetitive episodes of cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (CSD) and that these propagating waves trigger the expression of c-fos, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats underwent photochemically induced right common carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CCAT) (n = 18) or sham (n = 8) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of rats (n = 5), laser-Doppler flowmetry probes were placed overlying the right parietal cortex to record CSD-like changes in cortical blood flow during the initial 2-hour postinjury period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed by decapitation at 2 or 24 hours after CCAT, and brains were processed for in situ localization of the gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two to five intermittent transient hyperemic episodes lasting 1 to 2 minutes were recorded ipsilaterally after CCAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 2 hours after CCAT, the widespread expression of c-fos and BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> was observed throughout the ipsilateral cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor blocker MK-801 (2 mg/kg) 1 hour before CCAT reduced the expression of BDNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression at 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours after CCAT, increased expression of GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was present in cortical and subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, multifocal regions of HSP70 expression scattered throughout the thrombosed hemisphere were apparent at both 2 and 24 hours after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> lead to episodes of CSD and time-dependent alterations in gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ability of embolic processes to induce widespread molecular responses in neurons and glia may be important in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and may influence the susceptibility of the postembolic brain to subsequent insults including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
