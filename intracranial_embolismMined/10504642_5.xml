<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral emboli</z:e> occur during cardiopulmonary bypass and are a principal cause of postoperative neurologic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that arterial cannulation of the distal aortic arch, with placement of the cannula tip beyond the left subclavian artery, will result in fewer cerebral microemboli than conventional cannulation of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery with a single crossclamp technique were randomized to receive cannulation of the distal aortic arch (n = 17) or standard cannulation of the ascending aorta (control group, n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trendelenburg positioning was used whenever possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral emboli</z:e> were quantified by continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline demographics were similar for the 2 groups of patients, including cardiopulmonary bypass and crossclamp times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli were detected during cardiopulmonary bypass in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with a range of 17 to 627 emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total number of detected emboli was lower in the arch cannulation group (152 +/- 33, mean +/- standard error of the mean) than in the conventional cannulation group (249 +/- 35, P =.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Embolization rates were lower in distal arch patients than in control patients during cardiopulmonary bypass (2.0 +/- 0.3 vs 4.2 +/- 0.9 per minute, respectively, P =.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> by distal arch cannulation was most pronounced during perfusionist interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cannulation of the distal aortic arch results in less cerebral microembolism than conventional cannulation of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Provided it is performed safely, distal arch cannulation may be an important surgical option for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
