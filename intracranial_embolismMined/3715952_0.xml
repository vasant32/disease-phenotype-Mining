<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the size of endothelial cells is larger than that of other circulating blood cells, we investigated whether the increased number of circulating endothelial cells might be responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared rabbits into which suspensions of endothelial cells were injected through the common carotid arteries with control rabbits into which blood clots or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> were administered in the same manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Injected endothelial cells failed to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because the majority of exfoliated circulating endothelial cells were degenerated and deformed, the suspensions of endothelial cells obtained from rabbit aortas were treated by ultrasonic waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These suspensions also failed to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> cannot be induced by an increase of circulating endothelial cells alone </plain></SENT>
