<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exclusively cats were used as experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The staining procedures resulted in selective green fluorescence of vessel contents as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> protein, which was demonstrable even macroscopically at times, where <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation reaches a maximum in each experimental series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, serum protein could be traced up to the end of observation time ranging from 1 to 4 weeks, where the specific fluorescence was related to cellular structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As compared to other techniques employed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> localization, immunostaining mainly offers the following advantages: avoidance of in vivo tracing, better structural resolution in paraffin than in freeze sections, high specificity and sensitivity in antigen localization </plain></SENT>
