<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The examination included computed tomography of the head, echocardiography and transcranialdopplerographic monitoring of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 consisted of 53 (63.1%) patients with one source of cardiocerebral embolism, group 2-31 (36.9%) patients with two potential causes of cardial embolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group 2 average number of documented <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (3[1;5]) and average number of cerebral ischemic foci (2[1;2]) were greater than those of group 1-2[1;4] and 1[1;1], respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As to the size of the lesion, it was found that small, middle-size and large foci were also visualized in group 2 more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, combination of two sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> observed in 1/3 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> enhances cardiogenic embologenic potential and probability of microembolism transformation into cerebral focal lesion as a result of potentiation of different ways of thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
