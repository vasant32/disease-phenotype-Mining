<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 49-year-old woman had repeated episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and numbness of the right limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cranial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">Gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced MRI revealed multiple small lesions in the cortical-subcortical areas of the left middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A TCD examination on admission detected 4 embolic signals on the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk in a 30-minute examination period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> completely ceased after the initiation of an antiplatelet therapy with aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals were not detected in later TCD studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The embolic signals on the TCD strongly indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> are caused by an embolic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TCD is potentially useful for assessing the efficacy of antiplatelet and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
