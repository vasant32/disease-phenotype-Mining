<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heavily T2-weighted images provided an excellent lesion detection and a high specificity for the discrimination of different histological abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The T2-weighted images showed a brain lesion evolving during the first 24 h from a homogeneous hyperintense area, histologically corresponding to diffuse vasogenic and cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> with concomitant neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, to an iso-intense area with a hyperintense seam, which microscopically correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003070'>increased vascular permeability</z:mp> at the periphery of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hyperintense seam was observed up to day 7, but at that time coincided with gliomesodermal repair reaction which could be verified histochemically and ultrastructurally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It may be concluded that NMR-micro-imaging at a moderately high field, enables early detection and adequate follow-up of small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
