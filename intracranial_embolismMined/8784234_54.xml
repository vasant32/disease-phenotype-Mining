<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a first series of experiments, multiunit recordings were performed on anesthetized animals 2-3 mm lateral from the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean discharge frequency was considerably higher in recordings from lesioned animals (&gt; 100 Hz in the first postlesional week) compared with control animals (mean, 15 Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These alterations were already present after 1 day but were most pronounced 3 to 7 days after lesion induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thereafter the hyperexcitability declined again, although it remained visible up to 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a second series of experiments, the GABAA-receptor expression was studied autoradiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This revealed a reduction of GABAA receptors in widespread brain areas ipsilateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduction was most pronounced in the first days after lesion induction and declined with longer intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that cortical infarction due to photothrombosis leads to a long-lasting and widespread reduction of GABAA-receptor expression in the surround of the lesion, which is associated with an increased neuronal excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such alterations may be responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> that can be observed in some patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and may contribute to neurologic deficits after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
