<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 53 years (range: 36-65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients exhibited clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> at physical examination i.e. absolute <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional transthoracic echocardiography allowed the detection of potential cardiac sources of emboli in 2/13 patients (15.4%): <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> in one patient and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography was successfully performed without general sedation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential cardiac sources of emboli could be identified in 12/13 patients (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were found in 3 patients: in two of them they were associated with rheumatic alterations of mitral valve leaflets; in the third patient a small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was located inside a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized, poorly contracting left atrial appendage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left atrial appendage could be clearly visualized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A myxoid degeneration of a prolapsing mitral leaflet was found in 3 patients and an interatrial septum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, at color-flow Doppler and contrast transesophageal echocardiography, 7 patients (54%) showed patency of the foramen ovale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 5 of these patients paradoxical right to left shunting after cough or Valsalva manoeuvre could be evidenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With reference to 11/13 patients with no clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> at physical examination, subclinical potential cardiac sources of emboli could be detected at conventional transthoracic echocardiography in 1 and at transesophageal echocardiography in 10 patients (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
