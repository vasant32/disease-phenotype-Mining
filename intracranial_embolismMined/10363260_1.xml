<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several clinical cases of sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> have been reported, but localized cerebral cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is a fairly rare clinical entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a 51-year-old woman who presented with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT scan revealed subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> with perifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the left front-parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A T2W image revealed a large area of hyperintensity indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and coronal Gd enhanced T1 weighted image showed a reverse-triangle-shaped enhanced lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left carotid angiogram showed cerebral cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the left frontal lobe, but the superior sagittal sinus was not occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A month after admission, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> had suddenly improved and the patient could walk without any support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left carotid angiogram showed recanalization of thrombosed cortical veins and CT scan showed disappearance of any low density lesion indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is an important fact that neurological deficit improved quickly a month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and it was suspected that, even without resorting to fibrinolytic therapy, recanalization of thrombosed cerebral veins would still eventually occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found the reverse-triangle-shaped enhanced lesion on MRI and we suspected that it was typical finding for cerebral cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
