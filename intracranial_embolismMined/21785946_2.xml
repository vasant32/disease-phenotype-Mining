<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed plaque characteristics in carotid arteries using MDCT before CAS in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid plaques were expediently subdivided into four components with Hounsfield unit (HU) values of &lt;0, 0-60, 60-130, and &gt;600 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of distal embolism was evaluated with DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation analyses were used to assess the association between plaque composition and the incidence of cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (79%) demonstrated new DWI lesions after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-signal DWIs were noted as follows: one in six patients, 2 ~ 5 in five patients, 6 ~ 10 in two patients, and &gt;10 in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean volumes of the plaque components for HU &lt; 0, 0-60, 60-130, and &gt;600 were 5.4, 200, 260, and 59 mm(3), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between the number of high-signal DWI lesions in the ipsilateral side and the plaque volume of HU &lt; 0 (r = 0.927; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a moderate correlation between the number of high-signal DWI lesions and the plaque volume of HU 0-60 (r = 0.568; P = 0.0099) and the sum total of HU &lt; 0 and HU 0-60 (r = 0.609; P = 0.0047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative and qualitative tissue characterization of carotid plaques using MDCT might be a useful predictor for silent ischemic lesions after CAS </plain></SENT>
