<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Subclinical microemboli on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) have been identified immediately following carotid revascularization procedures, but the clinical significance and long-term effects are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term radiographic outcomes of these DWI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who underwent perioperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations for carotid interventions at a single institution from July 2004 to December 2008 were evaluated, particularly those who had additional follow-up MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DWI with apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2-weighted MRI images were compared to determine long-term effect of microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients (68 carotid artery stenting [CAS] and 100 carotid endarterectomy [CEA]) who received perioperative MRI were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CAS were performed with an embolic protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of microemboli was significantly higher in the CAS group than the CEA group (46.3% and 12%, respectively, P &lt; .05) despite a relative low incidence of procedure-associated neurologic symptoms in both groups (2.9% vs 2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (16 CAS and 14 CEA) who had follow-up MRI were further analyzed and a total of 50 postoperative DWI lesions (mean size 46.57 mm(2); range 16 to 128 mm(2)) were identified among them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a mean MRI follow-up of 10 months (range, 2 to 23 months), residual MRI abnormalities were only identified in DWI lesions larger than 60 mm(2) on postoperative MRI and on postoperative FLAIR images (n = 5, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CEA group had fewer but larger ipsilateral distributed emboli (total 12 lesions, mean 79 mm(2)) compared with the CAS group (total 38 lesions, mean 27.5 mm(2), P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of microemboli do not have long-term radiographic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Size and hyperintensity on postoperative FLAIR are predictive of residual brain structure abnormality, and further neurocognitive evaluations are warranted </plain></SENT>
