<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The photothrombotic ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model with sustained underperfusion followed by late spontaneous reperfusion (Gu et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1999) was employed to study its morphological consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exposed crania of adult male Wistar rats were subjected to a ring-shaped laser irradiation beam simultaneously with intravenous erythrosin B infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ischemic volume was calculated from serial sections throughout the ischemic lesions at 4, 10, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days and 28 days after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ischemic volume, expressed as a percentage of the ipsilateral hemispheric volume, increased steadily from 4 to 10 to 24 h to reach its maximum value at 48 h after irradiation; at 3 days, 7 days, and 28 days, the ischemic volume was reduced to 75%, 24%, and 22% of the value at 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of ischemic volumes at different anteroposterior levels revealed that the reduced ischemic volume at 72 h and later was mainly due to morphological restoration in the centrally located, nonirradiated region at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An initial enlargement and development of cystic coagulation <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was observed in the cortical areas corresponding to the ring lesion itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the region at risk, a gradually deteriorating neuropil and nerve cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were observed over time, with maximum severity at 48 h postirradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At this time, most laminae II and III neurons in the region at risk exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and pyknosis but no incrustations, with small islands of less damaged neurons randomly scattered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 72 h and up to 28 days after irradiation, these cell characteristics were no longer observed and the region at risk was well populated with neurons that had a chiefly unremarkable cytological appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neuronal counts in the central part of the region at risk were performed; no significant difference in neuronal density was observed between sham-operated controls and at 28 days after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the consistent, late spontaneous reperfusion coincided with remarkable tissue recovery as assessed morphologically in the region at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that nerve cell repair may occur even after the detection, by conventional morphological methods, of prolonged critical ischemic neuronal damage in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
