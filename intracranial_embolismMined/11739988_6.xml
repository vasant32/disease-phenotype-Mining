<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oral anticoagulation (OAC) and antiplatelet drugs are effective in the secondary prevention of ischemic cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only few data exist about the factors influencing the choice of a specific therapy for secondary prevention in patients with a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Within a cross-sectional study, nested in a cohort we identified 931 patients with a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> who were discharged with OAC or with one of the antiplatelet medications aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, or the combination of aspirin and extended-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By means of multivariate logistic regression analysis, we determined the influence of several clinical variables on the decision between OAC and overall antiplatelet therapy as well as on the decision between different antiplatelet therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A cardioembolic etiology of the index event and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were independently associated with the use of OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age was inversely associated with the use of OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Different estimations of contraindications to OAC were the main reason for the considerable variability among the participating centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most important factor promoting the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> was therapy with aspirin before the index event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with large- or small-vessel disease received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> more often than those with an event of undetermined etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found an extremely high interhospital variability for the use of the combination of aspirin with extended-release <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current recommendations are applied in clinical practice, but great variability between different centers remains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More clearly defined guidelines for indications for, as well as contraindications against, a specific therapy are necessary </plain></SENT>
