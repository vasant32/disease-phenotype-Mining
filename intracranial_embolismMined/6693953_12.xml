<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate possible approaches to the prevention and treatment of neural damage induced by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> and other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, a model was used in which cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> was produced by infusion of air (0.4 ml) into a vertebral artery of chloralose-anesthetized cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was assessed by measuring cortical somatosensory evoked responses in a group of 10 untreated animals and in a group of eight animals pretreated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the untreated group, the primary somatosensory amplitude was reduced to 28% +/- 9% (mean +/- standard error) of the value before <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>, with a return to 60% +/- 8% 1 hour and 73% +/- 12% 2 hours after embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the group pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>, the primary somatosensory amplitude was reduced to 68% +/- 9% of the value before <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>, with a return to 92% +/- 3% 1 hour and 97 +/- 2% 2 hours after embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> also greatly attenuated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and the increase in intracranial pressure following <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that pretreatment with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> significantly reduces the neural decrement and increases the recovery of neural function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
