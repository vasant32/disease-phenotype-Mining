<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship between the cerebrovascular responses to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 11 patients with unilateral occlusive or highly stenotic carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow was measured at the resting state, during the inhalation of 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>, at both 5 and 20 min after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(1 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rCBF ratios (occlusive/non-occlusive side) during the inhalation of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> and 20 min after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> i.v. closely correlated with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the ratio at 5 min after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> i.v. was slightly lower than that during the inhalation of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2 </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percent increases of rCBF also showed a significant correlation between 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation and 20 min after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the rCBF decreased inversely at 5 min after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> i.v. in some regions on the occlusive side, which indicates the presence of a so-called "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal phenomenon</z:e>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percent increases in the rCBF after 1 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> i.v. were more or equal to those during the inhalation of 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2 </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> were thus considered to be equally useful in the evaluation of the perfusion reserve capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, these various characteristics as described above should be considered in the clinical practice </plain></SENT>
