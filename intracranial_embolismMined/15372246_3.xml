<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid angioplasty and stenting, a so far non-validated procedure, may be an alternative to surgery in patients with a high surgical risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it carries also a risk of cerebral embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate tissue signal abnormalities in the brain before and after carotid angioplasty and stenting by means of diffusion- (DWI) and perfusion (PWI) weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed cerebral MRI before and after carotid angioplasty in 22 consecutive patients, with 23 treated high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesions were located at the origin of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in 20 patients, and at the origin of the common carotid artery (CCA) in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed the day before, and repeated within 24 hours after the procedure, and examined by two neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stent implantations were successful but 4 patients developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological deficit within 24 hours after carotid angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On PWI, Time To Peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) values ipsilateral to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were increased before the procedure in 15 patients, and had remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 6 and were not assessable in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> values were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 12 patients, increased in 8 and not assessable in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On DWI, new ipsilateral lesions were detected in 2 patients: 1 with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological deficit and 1 symptom free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Perfusion deficits may be present in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and be improved within 24 hours by carotid angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may occur </plain></SENT>
