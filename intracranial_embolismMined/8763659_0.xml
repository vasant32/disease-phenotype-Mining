<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of HSPD revealed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first one was a 36-year-old patient whith a pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, who gradually recovered without sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total and free protein S was decreased (55 and 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of his brothers died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> at 20 years and a sister had low protein S level without clinical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second case was a 26-year-old patient who had a right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> due to an infarction in middle cerebral artery area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He partially recovered, but the course of the illness was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> of the lower limbs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total and free serum protein S level was severely decreased (25 and 0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient's mother and one of his sisters also had low protein S but never had clinical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both case, dupplex scanning, transcranial doppler, echocardiography, serum antithrombin III and protein C were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These two cases suggest that HSPD must be investigated in young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, even in cases of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
