<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To detect cerebral embolic events during TAVR, intraoperative neuromonitoring using transcranial Doppler (TCD) was utilized in 28 patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> SAPIEN valve TF n = 18, TA n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High intensity transient signals (HITS) reflective of embolic events were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 83.4 ± 7.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality score was 11.7 ± 2.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of HITS during TAVR was not significantly different between the TF and the TA groups, respectively (375 ± 301, 440 ± 283, p = 0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest number of HITS occurred during wire manipulation in the arch and valve insertion (TF, 80 ± 110, 107 ± 81; TA, 120 ± 80, 92 ± 80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the TF group only, severe arch calcification was associated with significantly higher number of HITS both in total number of HITS (Grade I/II, 278 ± 71; Grade III/IV, 568 ± 479, p = 0.05) and during wire manipulation in the arch and valve insertion (Grade I/II, 140 ± 46, Grade III/IV 294 ± 239, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Highest cerebral embolic exposure occurred during wire manipulation in the arch and valve insertion in both the TF and TA groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arch calcification appears to be associated with increased embolic risk, specifically in the TF approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Understanding of the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> is needed for future strategies of cerebral protection during TAVR.  </plain></SENT>
