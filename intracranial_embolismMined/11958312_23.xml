<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine the possible beneficial effect of a new cerebral protection device based on balloon occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) and debris <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> for patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and eighty-four CAS procedures were attempted under cerebral protection using the PercuSurge GuardWire system in 167 patients (129 men; mean age 70.5 +/- 9.2 years, range 40-91)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions were mainly atherosclerotic, and half (n = 93) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen restenotic and 7 post-radiation stenoses were also treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success was 99.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were stented except 3 postangioplasty restenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic occlusion during balloon dilation and stenting was well tolerated in 176 (95.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microscopic analysis of the aspirated blood showed different types of particles numbering between 7 and 145 per procedure with a mean diameter of 250 microm (56-2652 microm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 2.7%: 3 periprocedural complications at &lt;48 hours (1 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>), 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> at 3 days, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> at 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study yielded a favorably low rate of periprocedural embolic events comparable with standard CAS series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Protection devices may play an important role in future carotid interventions and expand the applicability of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Randomized studies (surgery versus CAS with and without cerebral protection) are awaited </plain></SENT>
