<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Assuming <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> to be the origin of silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> during cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA), antiplatelet therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) should significantly reduce the risk for DSA-related silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess whether <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> does prevent DSA-related silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in terms of high signal intensity lesions in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a baseline DW-MRI 24 h before DSA and a follow-up DW-MRI 3-24 h after DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were considered to have an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (silent) infarction caused by DSA if there was at least one hyperintense lesion of at least 1 mm in diameter and no neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 52 patients in the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> group 11 (21.2%) had high signal lesions on DW-MRI and 20 out of 123 (16.3%) in the non-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship between the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and non-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> group and the post-angiographic appearance of high signal intensity lesions in DW-MRI could be found (Wilcoxon 2-sample test: p-value 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of oral antiplatelet therapy by <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (100 mg/day) in cerebrovascular patients did not prevent DSA-related high signal intensity lesions in DW-MRI in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite a potential bias of this retrospective analysis the findings challenge the current theory of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolisms</z:hpo> being the predominant origin of silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings therefore support alternative hypotheseses of the etiology of silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> and mobilized embolic material by the catheter at the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
