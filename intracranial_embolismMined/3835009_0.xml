<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 700 patients were admitted to our surgical intensive care unit with some degree of head trauma in a 24-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Score (GCS) was 8 or less in 90% of this group, and 3 or 4 in 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensory evoked responses were recorded in over 500 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study is reported to demonstrate that optimum care of the injured brain depends on titration of care aimed at maintaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuronal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our series, 25% of the patients with GCS of 3 or 4 returned home or to a rehabilitation unit, a significant decrease in morbidity over other reported series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> were a factor in the decision to monitor in 50-60% of the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, the auditory brainstem evoked response (ABR), a monitor of brainstem neuroelectrical function, and the somatosensory evoked response, a monitor of brainstem and cortical function, were used to follow the effectiveness of medical and surgical management in these patients, since neurologic examination was of limited value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Case reports are presented to demonstrate that even at high <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> levels, access to the integrity of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system is still possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relations among GCS, computerized tomography (CT), intracranial pressure (ICP), ABR, pupillary response, and outcome were studied for a subgroup of 114 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these clinical parameters, except CT findings, were significantly correlated with outcome using Chi-square analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When the data were further analyzed with linear regression analysis, however, the only parameters that significantly correlated with outcome were pupil reactivity and ABR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The principal conclusion of this report is that the main application of serial monitoring of the sensory central pathway in the head-injured patient is not in the prediction of outcome but in the titration of care of the patient for the preservation of neuronal function </plain></SENT>
