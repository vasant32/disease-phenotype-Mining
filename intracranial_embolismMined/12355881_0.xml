<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) diffusion-weighted (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in a patient suffered with CFE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 26-year-old man with a right femoral bone fracture lapsed into a semicoma eight hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen hours after the depressed consciousness, DWI and FLAIR images on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging showed multiple high-intensity spots in <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, basal ganglia, thalamus, corpus callosum, brain stem and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thereby, he was diagnosed as CFE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These multiple lesions were more detectable on FLAIR images than DWI, particularly in posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, follow-up DWI, FLAIR, and T 2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> image (T 2 WI) showed most of the lesions disappeared or shrunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resolution of the lesions suggests that most of the lesions were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> as a result of the unique pathophysiological condition of CFE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remained lesions were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The consciousness of the patient improved alert </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three months later, follow-up MRI showed almost complete resolution of the abnormal intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow up DWI and FLAIR images observed in the patient indicated that many small lesions occurs throughout the whole brain without a preferential region, and many of the lesions can subside or attenuate in CFE </plain></SENT>
