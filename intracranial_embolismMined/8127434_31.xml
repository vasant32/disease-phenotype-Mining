<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animals, the delayed reaction paradigm is considered to be a specific marker of the function of dorsolateral region of the prefrontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It seemed of interest, therefore, to attempt to apply this paradigm to patients with recent and limited cortical lesion of vascular origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The performance of patients with dorsolateral prefrontal lesion (n = 10) was compared to that of patients with post-central lesion (n = 10) and control subjects (n = 24), in four experiments: a Delayed Response task in which the correct answer was previously indicated by an explicit cue (externally guided task); Delayed Alternation and Non-Alternation tasks coupled with a Delayed Reversal task in which the patient had to discover the rule by himself in the absence of explicit cues (internally driven tasks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with prefrontal lesion showed a specific deficit in the Delayed Response task, the emergence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038271" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">stereotyped behaviour</z:e> in the Delayed Alternation task and an inability to deduce and to transfer rules (non-alternation and reversal), mainly because of difficulty in abandoning previous behaviours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that the prefrontal cortex plays a role in behavioural adaptation to challenging new situations by inhibiting not only ongoing elaborated programmes but also the emergence of previously established automatic programmes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The respective role of the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia in these two levels of behavioural organization is discussed </plain></SENT>
