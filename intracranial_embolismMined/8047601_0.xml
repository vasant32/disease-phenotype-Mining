<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, our first four patients to undergo cardiomyoplasty (from February 1991 until April 1992) with a left latissimus dorsi island flap, rotated into the thorax after a 3-week training period, are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic indications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with contraindication for heart transplant in patients 1 and 4 and associated to surgery for left ventricle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> for patients 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 died 4 months after surgery because of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> when he was at functional class II </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction values (obtained through echocardiography and scintigraphy studies) and maximum minute flow rate of blood (measured with an echo-Doppler) have increased significantly (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.05, and p &lt; 0.01, respectively) after heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement has been found after cardiomyoplasty, which correlates with an increase in ejection fraction and maximum minute flow rate of blood </plain></SENT>
