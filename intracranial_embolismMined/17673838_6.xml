<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> during protected carotid artery stenting (CAS) as well as to compare the protective efficacy of the balloon and filter devices on diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-one consecutive protected CAS procedures in 70 patients with a severe (&gt; 70%) or symptomatic moderate (&gt; 50%) carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A balloon device (PercuSurge GuardWire) and a filter device (FilterWire EX/EZ, Emboshield) was used in 33 cases (CAS-B group) and 38 cases (CAS-F group) to prevent distal embolization, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent DWI within seven days before and after the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of new cerebral ischemic lesions on the post-procedural DWI were counted and divided into ipsilateral and contralateral lesions according to the relationship with the stenting side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: New cerebral ischemic lesions were detected in 13 (39.4%) out of the 33 CAS-Bs and in 15 (39.5%) out of the 38 CAS-Fs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean number of total, ipsilateral and contralateral new cerebral ischemic lesion was 2.39, 1.67 and 0.73 in the CAS-B group and 2.11, 1.32 and 0.79 in the CAS-F group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistical differences were found between the two groups (p = 0.96, 0.74 and 0.65, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The embolic complications encountered included two <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> infarctions and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in the CAS-B group (9.09%), and one <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> infarction, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> in the CAS-F group (7.89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a similar incidence of embolic complications in the two groups (p = 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The type of distal protection device used such as a balloon and filter does not affect the incidence of cerebral embolization after protected CAS </plain></SENT>
