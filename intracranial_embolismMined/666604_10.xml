<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Saccades (horizontal and vertical) and dissociated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> were quantitatively assessed in four patients with internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients had bilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) lesions associated with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and two had unilateral lesions associated with brain stem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adducting saccades made on the side of an MLF lesion were slowed in each patient (P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the same time, abducting saccades in the contralateral eye had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> velocity, but consistently overshot the target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the overshoot, the eye returned to the target with an exponentially decaying course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With large angular deviations (usually more than 15 degrees), the abducting eye developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> characterized by slow components that moved toward the midposition with an initially high velocity followed by a segment of slower velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adducting eye had either no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> or a low-amplitude <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> characterized by a rounded junction between the fast and slow component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The saccade abnormalities and waveform of the dissociated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> can be explained by a pulse-step mismatch at the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> motoneurons </plain></SENT>
