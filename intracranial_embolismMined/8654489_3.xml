<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebro- and cardiovascular workup, however, led to a diagnosis of paradoxical cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> through a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since there is hardly any evidence in the literature that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> acts as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on its own, these case reports emphasize the importance of complete cardiovascular evaluation in patients with suspected migrainous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
