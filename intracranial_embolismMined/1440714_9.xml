<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this limited study using long-term transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring was to estimate the frequency of clinically silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial embolisms</z:e> in patients with symptomatic extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF REPORT: By means of a 2-MHz pulsed-wave transcranial Doppler instrumentation, three consecutive patients with extracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (n = 2) or occlusion (n = 1) and recurrent ipsilateral ischemic events were monitored (19 hours total recording time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 10 control subjects without cerebrovascular disease were studied (25 hours total recording time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Formed-element emboli were defined as distinct signals within the fast Fourier-transform Doppler spectrum that were &lt; 70 msec in duration and &gt; 9dB greater in intensity than the background signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically silent formed-element embolism of ophthalmic or cerebral arteries was demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Embolic events occurred only in the territory of the symptomatic internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average rate of cerebral embolization at transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was 4.1/hr, with a mean signal duration of 47 msec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No emboli were found in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed high frequency of silent embolism of the intracranial arteries detected by transcranial Doppler monitoring in patients with recurrently symptomatic extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> should encourage studies of the prognostic and therapeutic implications of this method </plain></SENT>
