<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A new surgical technique for proximal anastomosis without using a side-biting clamp or any proximal anastomotic device in OPACB has been developed and successfully used for proximal anastomosis between a great saphenous vein or radial artery graft and the aorta in OPCAB of 138 patients, with good short-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This novel technique proximal anastomosis in OPACB can be completed in a safe, easy and economical fashion </plain></SENT>
