<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 24-year-old male developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome (FES) 18 hours after accidental tibial and metatarsal fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> and hypoxemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple prolonged portable electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings showed a variety of progressively changing patterns including continuous high amplitude EEG rhythmical synchronous slowing (CHERSS), triphasic waves, bilateral independent periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (BIPLEDs), frontal intermittent delta activity (FIRDA), and low amplitude irregular generalized theta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three months after the accident, the patient was neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and his EEG exhibited only rare brief bursts of anterior theta in the waking recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>I conclude that EEG periodic activity such as CHERSS, triphasic waves, BIPLEDs, and FIRDA can occur in patients suffering from cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It reflects a non-specific diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> not necessarily associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prolonged and frequent bedside EEG recordings will demonstrate better these fluctuating abnormalities in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> (and probably in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> of other origin) than standard less frequent recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Very likely, these periodic EEG patterns have not been previously identified in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> because they were not in vogue among electroencephalographers nor widely accepted at the time studies dealing with this syndrome were written </plain></SENT>
