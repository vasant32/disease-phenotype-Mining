<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the frequency of cerebral microembolism detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in patients with clinical evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp>, including transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, central and branch <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery infarction, and ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oculopathy</z:e>, and assessed its correlation with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of 331 consecutive patients examined during a 47-month period at the Neurovascular Laboratory were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the original 453 intracranial arteries, 186 middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) satisfied qualifying criteria that excluded patients with cardiac embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-five <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> ipsilateral to the symptomatic eye constituted the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 141 asymptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microembolus detection studies were performed on transcranial Doppler instruments equipped with special software, and the degree of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was measured by cerebral or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography or by color duplex studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microembolism was detected in 40.0% of study <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> and 9.2% of controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the study group, microembolic signals were detected in 61.9% of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> tested within a week of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and 20.8% of those tested afterward (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe (&gt; or = 70%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion was more frequent in the study group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals were detected in 25.3% and 11.2%, respectively, of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> distal to carotid arteries with 70% to 100% and 0% to 69% stenosis (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients without cardiac embolic sources, cerebral microembolism is frequently present on the side of <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp>, particularly during the week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is often associated with severe stenosis or occlusion of the ipsilateral carotid artery </plain></SENT>
