<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent epidemiological studies and new approaches in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) incite to reconsider its incidence on medical aircrew certification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paroxysmal as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF are common diseases and are found among pilots particularly when advanced in years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is usually associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, especially with rheumatic valvulopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However idiopathic or "lone" AF is observed in subjects apparently-free of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality is twice higher in patient suffering from AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is responsible for miscellaneous symptoms among which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> or even <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> is however the most severe complication occurring even in cases of AF unrelated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this risk would be less in paroxysmal AF and "lone" AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The management of AF aims at restoring sinus rhythm and preventing recurrences or, at least, at controlling heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrences are frequent after cardioversion despite the use of antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover the latter can induce adverse effects and are potentially proarrhythmogenic, which can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy significantly lowers the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> but at the risk of haemorrhages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New invasive techniques therapy are still experimental and can be responsible for severe complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk of sudden incapacitation remains a reality in crew members suffering from AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This increases with age, with frequency of the attacks or chronicity, in presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or in case of antiarrhythmic or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Paroxysmal forms have a lower rate of complications but are more frequently responsible for symptoms incompatible with flight, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> forms, although less symptomatic when heart rate is properly controlled, present more complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> idiopathic AF could be considered for restricted certification but submitted to regular follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, a pilot developing an isolated episode of AF triggered off by reversible conditions and free of risk factors has little chance of frequent recurrences or complications and might be eligible for flight </plain></SENT>
