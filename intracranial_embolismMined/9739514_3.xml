<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in the thoracic aorta and the branches of the aortic arch using transesophageal echocardiography in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and simultaneously searched for potential cardiac sources for emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombi</z:e> were detected in the left atrial appendage in nine of 54 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and these patients were excluded </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the wall was measured in the branches of the aortic arch (brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery) as well as the thoracic aorta (ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending aorta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>Atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were defined as increased echogenicity of the intima (intimal thickening), calcification, protruded plaque, ulceration or plaque with cystic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The thicknesses of the wall in the aortic arch (3.84 +/- 1.25 vs 2.71 +/- 1.33 mm, p &lt; 0.01), left common carotid artery (2.67 +/- 1.10 vs 2.16 +/- 0.91 mm, p &lt; 0.05) and the left subclavian artery (2.52 +/- 0.67 vs 2.15 +/- 0.88 mm, p &lt; 0.05) were significantly greater in patients than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of plaque or ulceration was significantly increased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects in the aortic arch (76% vs 43%, p &lt; 0.05) and left common carotid artery (44% vs 17%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
