<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its feasibility and safety in clinical practice at a broad spectrum of hospitals needs to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data of the prospective multi-centre Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS) Registry of the German Arbeitsgemeinschaft Leitende Kardiologische Krankenhausarzte (ALKK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 7/1996 to 5/2004 1888 patients from 28 hospitals were included in the CAS Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median hospital stay from CAS until hospital discharge was 3 days (quartiles: 2-6 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median patients age was 70 years (quartiles: 64-76 years) with 72.1% males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CAS for symptomatic stenosis was performed in 55% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with CAS suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in 66.5%, had arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 91.7%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> in 86.3% and 34.2% were diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intended CAS procedure was completed in 98.1% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A stent was implanted in 97.3% of completed cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median intervention time was 43 min (quartiles: 30-60 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the hospital stay <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 0.3% (5/1888) and the rate of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 3.2% (58/1840) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A contralateral ischemic event occurred in 1.4% (26/ 1840) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The combined rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was 3.8% (70/1841) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Between 1996 and 2004 there was a steady increase in the use of protection devices during CAS (0% in 1996 and 97.9% in 2004; p for trend &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was also an increase in the proportion of patients treated for asymptomatic stenoses (p for trend &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We observed a decrease of the combined endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from 6.3% in 1996 to 1.9% in 2004 (p for trend=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The multi-centre ALKK CAS Registry data confirm the feasibility and shot-term safety of CAS even in daily clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There was a rapid penetration of the use of embolic protection devices, an increase in treatment of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> and a decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complication rates from 1996 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
