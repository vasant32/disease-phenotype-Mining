<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty nine patients with midbrain infarction (9.4%) are described out of a series of 415 patients with vertebrobasilar ischaemic lesions in the New England Medical Center Posterior Circulation Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorised according to the rostral-caudal extent of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The "proximal" vertebrobasilar territory includes the medulla and posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The "middle" territory includes the pons and anterior inferior cerebellar artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The "distal" territory includes the rostral midbrain, thalami, superior cerebellum, and medial temporal and occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Midbrain infarction was accompanied by "proximal" territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in four patients, and by "middle" territory infarction in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had associated "distal" territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, three of whom had occipital or temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only three patients had isolated midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardioembolism (n=11), in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n=9), large artery to artery embolism (n=7), and intrinsic branch penetrator disease (n=5) were the most common aetiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bilateral infarction and accompanying pontine infarction were associated with the most extensive vertebrobasilar occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Midbrain infarction was 10-fold more likely to be accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> of neighbouring structures than it was to occur in isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the different patterns of infarction may act as a guide to the underlying aetiology and vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
