<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To examine the effect of screening the aorta for atheroma before aortic manipulation and use of exclusive Y graft revascularization on the incidence of neuropsychological dysfunction after coronary artery bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Aortic atheroma was detected using epiaortic and transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Atheroma avoidance was facilitated by use of the exclusive Y graft technique, which has no aortic coronary anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control group aortic atheroma was assessed by manual palpation, and we attempted to avoid any atheroma detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this group we also used aorta-coronary grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler imaging of the right middle cerebral artery was used to detect cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological dysfunction was defined as a 20% or more decline in score for at least 20% of a neuropsychometric battery of ten tests for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Late dysfunction at 57 +/- 2 days postoperatively in the control group was 38.1% and in the echo/Y group was 3.8% (p' = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microemboli detected by transcranial Doppler imaging during periods of aortic manipulation was greater for those with late dysfunction (5.2 +/- 3.0 compared with 0.5 +/- 0.2) (p' = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combined techniques of epiaortic screening and exclusive Y graft for coronary artery bypass operations resulted in a low incidence of late neuropsychological dysfunction </plain></SENT>
