<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the cerebral protection technique used in the angioplasty and stenting to treat stenotic lesions of carotid artery bifurcation, showing its efficiency in avoiding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Forty two patients (47 arteries) were treated with the cerebral protection technique, which consists in the temporary occlusion of the internal carotid artery, above the stenotic lesion, performing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and flushing of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> solution into the internal carotid artery after the delivery of the stent and the angioplasty, to remove any atherosclerotic plaque's fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The angioplasty was efficient in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in the patients in whom the complete cerebral protection technique was used, showing its efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distal embolism occurred in one patient, during pre angioplasty and before the use of cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cerebral protection technique was efficient to avoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in the procedures performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This data is in agreement with the literature and the use of this technique increases the indications of carotid angioplasty </plain></SENT>
