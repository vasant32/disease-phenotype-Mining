<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study describes a method for improving the precision and accuracy of clot placement within the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) of rats, utilizing a micro-catheter and laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique reduces the size of clot needed to achieve stable occlusion with no failed embolizations and a low percentage of early recanalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infarctions were consistent in both size and distribution within the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> perfusion territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective embolization in aged animals (n = 10) resulted in substantially larger infarctions than those seen in aged animals (n = 10) following non-selective embolization (P &lt; 0.05), or young animals (n = 10) subjected to filamentous occlusion (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clots were localized to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> by direct examination at 0, 60 and 120 min post-embolization (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aged animals surviving 24h exhibited moderate to severe functional deficits, with selectively occluded animals having a higher mean score on the modified neurologic severity scale (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This model provides a highly reproducible method for embolization of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and reliable reperfusion with rt-PA </plain></SENT>
