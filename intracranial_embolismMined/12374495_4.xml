<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can more easily detect small or multiple ischemic lesions than conventional imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the ischemic lesion patterns on DWI and to discuss the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in ICA disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We enrolled 35 consecutive patients who had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and (&gt; or = 70%) stenosis or an occlusion of the extracranial ICA confirmed by cerebral angiography and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion on DWI within 1 week of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, but without cardiac sources of embolism and tandem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The lesion pattern on DWI was categorized as territorial or border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple ischemic lesions were defined as noncontiguous lesions on DWI in more than 1 vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 3 distinctive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(1) A territorial lesion without a border-zone lesion was found in 21 patients: superficial and superficial territorial in 9, superficial and deep territorial in 7, and single in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) A border-zone lesion with or without a territorial lesion was found in 10 patients: border zone and territorial in 9 and border zone alone in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(3) Bilateral hemispheric lesions were found in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple ischemic lesions were found in 29 (82.9%) of the 35 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patient had episodes of hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesion in ICA occlusive disease is mainly multiple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Border-zone infarction was mostly associated with territorial infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results support the fact that embolism is the predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism in ICA occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
