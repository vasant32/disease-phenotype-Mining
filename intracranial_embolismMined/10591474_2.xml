<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is recommended when the condition of the patients is deteriorating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of T-477 [(R)-(+)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,3-dihydro-4-diethyl aminoacetyl-4H-1,4-benzorthiazine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>], a novel neuronal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel blocker, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by intra-arterial infusion of 1000 microspheres into the forebrain of freely moving rats, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T-477 was intravenously infused continuously for 24 h or twice for 3 h with a 3-h interval between infusions immediately after microsphere injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T-477 dose-dependently inhibited the increase in brain water content by both infusion procedures; the inhibition was statistically significant at doses of 25 mg/kg per 24 h and 14 mg/kg per 9 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, infusion of T-477 at a dose of 14 mg/kg per 9 h significantly inhibited the decrease in K content and the increase in Ca content of the forebrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, T-477 prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> following microsphere-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
