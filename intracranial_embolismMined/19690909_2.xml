<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the degree of the risk it causes is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the risk of systemic fat mobilization and fat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in rats following liposuction using dry and tumescent techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At the end of the procedures, the rats were sacrificed and specimens were obtained from the lungs, kidneys, liver, brain, and skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological examinations of the specimens were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liposuction was not performed in the control group (n = 8), but blood and tissue specimens for histological examinations were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found signs of fat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in both blood specimens and histological examinations of tissue samples in the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the results of the examinations were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there were no fat particles in the blood before liposuction, blood specimens obtained following the procedures and in the long-term had fat particles </plain></SENT>
