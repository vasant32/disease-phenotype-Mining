<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diffusion-weighted (DWI) and perfusion-weighted (PI) MRI are highly sensitive techniques for early diagnosis of arterial infarction, but little data on venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a case in which DWI, PI, and fast T2-weighted sequences were performed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: An 11-year-old girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> developed deep CVT in which extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was shown in the deep gray matter on T2-weighted sequence images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isotropic echo-planar DWI demonstrated a local augmentation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (1.1 to 1.6x10(-3) mm2/s), consistent with vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In dynamic contrast-enhanced PI, the regional cerebral blood volume was increased and the passage time of the contrast bolus was markedly prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the patient recovered totally after intravenous full-dose heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T2 abnormalities, apparent diffusion coefficient values (0.8 to 0.92x10(-3) mm2/s), and brain perfusion alterations resolved without damage to brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unlike arterial infarction, DWI demonstrated vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in a patient with deep CVT, which proved to be reversible in follow-up magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PI showed areas with extensive venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, but perfusion deficits were missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we believe that DWI and PI may play a role in detecting venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> in CVT and in prospective differentiation of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and venous infarction </plain></SENT>
