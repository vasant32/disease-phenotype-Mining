<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The natural history of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> and the surgical risks are modified by several factors including size, location, and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> arises because the backgrounds of the past reports describing the natural history or the surgical complication of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to adjust the backgrounds and investigate the surgical indication with close monitoring of both surgically treated and untreated unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the past 9 years, 201 patients who had unruptured anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decision of the operation was not randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three subgroups by the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (small group: below 5 mm, medium group: between 5 and 15 mm, large group: over 15 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both surgically untreated and treated patients, overall mortality and morbidity corresponding to Rankin score II or worse was counted as unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> related event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of event free was compared between surgically treated and untreated patients using Log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In untreated patients, SAH was noted in 1 in the small group and 4 in the medium group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The annual rupture rate of the medium group was 12 times higher than that of the small group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In surgically treated patients, overall mortality and morbidity of the surgery was 2.3% in the small group, 3.6% in the medium group, and 20% in the large group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One surgically treated patient had SAH because of regrowth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When ratio of event free was compared, no significant advantage of surgery was noted in the small group and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the benefit of surgery was significant in the medium group (Log-rank p = 0.0189) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicated that prophylactic surgery has a benefit for the medium-size <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (5-15 mm) of the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, individual investigation is necessary because of the variety of surgical difficulties, and the complex symptoms because of rupture and the mass effect as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, careful observation may be a reasonable choice unless the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is at a specially high risk of rupture </plain></SENT>
