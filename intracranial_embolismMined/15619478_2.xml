<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined our experience of carotid stenting with routine cerebral embolization protection in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical variables and treatment outcome of high-risk patients who underwent carotid stenting with neuroprotection were analyzed during a 26-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-eight high-risk patients with 72 carotid artery stenoses were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Procedural success was achieved in 70 cases (97%), and symptomatic lesions existed in 17 (24%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monorail Wallstents stents were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective devices used were PercuSurge (28%) and Filterwire (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no periprocedural mortality or neuroprotective device-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 2.7%, and the overall complication rate was 6.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stented vessels remained patent during the follow-up period (mean 15.3 +/- 4.2, range 1 to 23 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two asymptomatic in-stent restenosis (3%) occurred at 6 and 8 months, which were both successfully treated with balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that percutaneous carotid stenting with routine use of a cerebral protection device is a feasible and effective treatment in high-risk patients with carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
