<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism causing microemboli has remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to clarify clinical characteristics and circumstances associated with the genesis of TCD-detected microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-one cases with more than 30% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring was carried out for an hour at the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery of each case using a 2-MHz pulse-wave transcranial Doppler device, and high intensity transient signals were counted as microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) were also performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were detected in 30 of 91 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were significantly well detected in cases with a history of ischemic event and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> recognized by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detection of microemboli had no relation to sex, age or clinical risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and smoke <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">habituation</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, detection of microemboli was significantly related to decrease in cerebral blood flow recognized by SPECT, severity of stenosis and wall irregularity of lesion recognized by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microemboli can be found in a significantly high percentage of these clinical conditions, which may be risk factors for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by extracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
