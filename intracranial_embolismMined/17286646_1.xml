<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Interatrial block (IAB; P wave &gt; or = 110 ms) is highly prevalent and is strongly associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias and left atrial dysfunction, making it a potential embolic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 293 neurological admissions over 2 years, 85 patients were diagnosed with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 208 with nonembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were then matched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors and evaluated for IAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight percent of probable embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients showed sinus rhythm, demonstrating a 61% IAB prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001; r = 0.3) and IAB (P &lt; 0.006; r = 0.2) were significant and directly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IAB could indeed be a novel risk for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and further investigation is warranted </plain></SENT>
