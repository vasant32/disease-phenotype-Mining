<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) can be detected by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify gaseous microemboli the inhalation of oxygen is an established method in patients with prosthetic heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Time domain analysis of sample volume length (SVL) and of frequency modulation showed promising results in the discrimination between solid and gaseous microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether these time domain analyses allow the discrimination of different types of microemboli in patients with the non-pulsatile DeBakey left ventricular assist device (LVAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Repeated unilateral detection of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was performed by TCD in 20 patients supported with DeBakey LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each monitoring session consisted of 20 minutes without and 20 minutes with inhalation of 100% oxygen (6 l/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 500 MES, detected with (n=250) or without (n=250) the supply of oxygen, were randomly chosen for offline analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SVL (in cm) was calculated by duration and velocity of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> measured in the time domain mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, frequency modulation of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was classified into three main types: Without modulation (type I), with gradual changes (type II) and with rapid changes (type III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With oxygen supply, both prevalence (26.4% versus 36.2%, p&lt;0.01) and mean counts of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> per hour (49+/-293 versus 108+/-550, p&lt;0.001) significantly declined compared with the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> load while breathing room air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the SVL of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> under oxygen (0.85+/-0.38 cm) compared with those without oxygen delivery (0.92+/-0.37 cm, p=0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no significant differences were noted for the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> frequency modulation types in time domain analysis with regard to oxygen supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> under oxygen delivery confirms the gaseous nature in a substantial number of circulating microemboli produced by the DeBakey LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, SVL and frequency modulation of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> did not appear to provide valuable information regarding the structural nature of the underlying microembolic material </plain></SENT>
