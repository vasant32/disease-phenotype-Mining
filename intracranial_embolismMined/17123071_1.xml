<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, mechanical embolectomy has been proposed as an effective method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a preclinical evaluation of a new mechanical clot-retrieving wire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This clot-retrieving wire consisted of three nitinol loops at the tip of a microguidewire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These three loops could be collapsed into a 0.018-inch wire compatible microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each loop was 8 mm long and 3.5 mm wide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For simulation, polyvinyl alcohol (<z:chebi fb="10" ids="53706">PVA</z:chebi>) vascular anatomical models of the human carotid (eight models) and vertebrobasilar (three models) circulation were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pulsatile flow circulation system was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Embolic clots were produced using pig blood plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The microcatheter and the microguidewire were advanced beyond the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The wire was then exchanged for the retrieving wire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The microcatheter was then pulled slightly back to open the loops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clot was then caught by withdrawal of the system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Once caught, the clot was retrieved to the guiding catheter tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We investigated the following points: ease of device deployment, clot capture ability, clot removal against blood flow and removal of the clot out of the introducer system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 104 procedures were performed in 11 PVA models and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The drop rate was 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We succeeded in partial and total recanalization in 51.0% of the procedures (53/104) within 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This new clot-retrieving wire could be useful for mechanical clot extraction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
