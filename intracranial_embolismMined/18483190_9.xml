<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Growing evidence of the relationship between poor antiplatelet response and occurrence of clinical events elicited the need of monitoring the response which has not been part of our daily practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our initial experience with a new point-of-care antiplatelet-function test (VerifyNow assay) in neurointerventional procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among the 106 consecutive patients from July 2006 to April 2007, ninety-eight met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our preferred antiplatelet regimen was aspirin (325 mg daily) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (300 mg of loading dose followed by 75 mg daily) starting 5-10 days before the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The test results were reported as aspirin-reaction unit (ARU) for aspirin and P2Y(12) reaction units (PRU), baseline (BASE), and percentage inhibition for the P2Y(12) assay and were summarized as mean +/- SD of the values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the effects of several factors of poor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> response (&lt;40% inhibition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of thrombotic events was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean ARU of aspirin assays was 438.3 +/- 47.9 (range, 350-632), and the response was poor in 2 patients (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, the mean of the BASE, PRU, and percentage inhibition was 356.8 +/- 56.3 (range, 234-495), 198.9 +/- 104.4 (range, 8-401), and 45.2 +/- 27.1% (range, 0-98), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients (42.9%) showed poor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed greater body weight (81.9 Kg +/- 19.1 kg versus 69.9 +/- 15 kg) in the poor-response group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 cases of intraprocedural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (3.1%) were observed only in the poor-response group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We observed a high frequency of poor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> responses in the neurointerventional setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Routine monitoring of the drug response would be helpful for the early identification of poor antiplatelet responders so that we may modify the regimen and/or treatment plan </plain></SENT>
