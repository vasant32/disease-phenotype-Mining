<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We treated two patients with asymptomatic high grade internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, by carotid artery stenting (CAS) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection filters 75% and 70%, respectively (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immediate cranial and carotid angiogram showed a good result with regular patency of carotid and cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the CAS procedure was complicated with symptomatic embolism, in one case 6 h after CAS and the other one occurring after seven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The duplex scan (DS) control revealed the presence of plaque protrusion intra-stent in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An early treatment with stent removal and carotid surgery was performed &lt;24 h after the presenting symptoms (in one case a standard endarterectomy in the other and a carotid bypass was performed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients were discharged without neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At neurological follow-up at 30 days the patients were in good general condition without neurological symptoms or deficit and the DS follow-up at 30 days and six to 12 months show the patency of carotid vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These two cases demonstrate that plaque protrusion is a possible complication of CAS, where symptoms which may occur either immediately or later and can be managed successfully with urgent surgical intervention of carotid stent removal </plain></SENT>
