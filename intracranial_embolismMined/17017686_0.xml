<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is becoming increasingly common for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating data, but not randomised data, suggest that CAS has promising efficacy in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with an acceptable rate of procedure-related complications when compared to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, CAS procedures can carry a risk of non-negligible complications such as cerebral embolization, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These may occur after the first 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lessons may be learned from the timing of occurrence of CAS adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most severe neurological complications are generally due to embolism and occur intraprocedurally especially during catheter, wire or sheath manipulation in the aortic arch and common carotid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, obviously, cannot be prevented by using cerebral protection devices and enhance the importance of an appropriate learning curve that includes proper material choice, patient selection, good technique and the skill of "know when to quit" </plain></SENT>
