<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:   Recanalization is strongly associated with outcomes after thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac emboli are known as better response to fibrinolytic agents because they are fibrin-rich; however, cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> itself is associated with poor outcomes and high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Completeness of recanalization may therefore affect the outcome of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether degree of recanalization influences outcomes following fibrinolytic therapy in cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:   Consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with relevant <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> on baseline CT angiography who had received thrombolytic treatment were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Completeness of recanalization was assessed by the Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI) grade, which was compared between patients with and without cardiac sources of embolism (CSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also investigated independent predictors of poor outcome (modified Rankin scale score 3-6) at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   Of the 127 patients enrolled, 65 (51%) had one or more CSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the overall recanalization rates (TIMI 2 or 3) in patients with CSE (65%) and patients without CSE (68%) were similar (P=0.710), patients with CSE were less likely to show complete recanalization (TIMI 3) compared with those without CSE (19% vs. 39%, P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that CSE was associated with failure of complete recanalization (OR 2.809, 95% CI 1.097-7.192) and was an independent predictor of poor outcome at 3months (OR 3.629, 95% CI 1.205-8.869) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:   In cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, failure of complete recanalization following thrombolytic therapy was frequent and was associated with poor outcome after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
