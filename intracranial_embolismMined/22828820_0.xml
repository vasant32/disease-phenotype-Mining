<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a case of cerebral venous gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our patient made a complete neurological recovery after hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The principles of HBOT, compressing and eliminating air bubbles and decreasing Î’-2 integrin function, thus improving microcirculation, can only be beneficial in a situation where neurological damage is likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrograde cerebral venous gas embolism is a less well recognised variant of gas embolism than the arterial variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its existence as a different entity is better recognised in the forensic medicine and radiology literature than in other disciplines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is evidence in the literature of patients dying from this complication and others seemingly experiencing very little effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case report highlights this condition, to encourage others to look out for it and report outcomes, and to serve as a reminder that peripheral lines may be a potential cause of gas embolism, although the portal of air entry in our case remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
