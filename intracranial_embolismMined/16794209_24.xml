<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Information regarding the histological structure of thromboemboli that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> provides insight into pathogenesis and clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This report describes the histological analysis of thromboemboli retrieved by endovascular mechanical extraction from the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and intracranial carotid artery (ICA) of 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The large majority (75%) of thromboemboli shared architectural features of random fibrin:platelet deposits interspersed with linear collections of nucleated cells (monocytes and neutrophils) and confined erythrocyte-rich regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This histology was prevalent with both cardioembolic and atherosclerotic sources of embolism. "Red" clots composed uniquely of erythrocytes were uncommon and observed only with incomplete extractions, and cholesterol crystals were notably absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histology of thromboemboli that could not be retrieved from 29 concurrent patients may be different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> &gt;3 mm wide caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> limited to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> &gt;5 mm wide was removed from the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mycotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was successfully removed in 1 case, and a small atheroma and attached intima were removed without clinical consequence from another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thromboemboli retrieved from the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or intracranial ICA of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> have similar histological components, whether derived from cardiac or arterial sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>Embolus</z:mpath> size determines ultimate destination, those &gt;5 mm wide likely bypassing the cerebral vessels entirely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fibrin:platelet pattern that dominates thromboembolic structure provides a foundation for both antiplatelet and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment strategies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
