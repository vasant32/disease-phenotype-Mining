<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Introduction: Autologous bone marrow (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) are increasingly used to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reported incidence of neurological complications varies greatly among the different centers, ranging from 11 to 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients and Methods: In order to gain insight into the real incidence of early neurological complications (first 6 weeks) after autologous transplantation, we analyzed a series of 254 patients who underwent BMT/PBSCT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> (212 cases) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> (42 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: Seven patients died during the early posttransplant period (incidence: 2.4%), and one of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> was related to a neurological complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients developed neurologic complications (incidence: 2.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> during the early posttransplant period, despite a rather restrictive platelet transfusion support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two out of 13 patients diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 3 out of 36 patients diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> developed early neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discussion and Conclusions: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> related to autologous transplantation was very low in our series of patients as compared to that reported in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference could be explained, at least in part, by a more restrictive definition of early neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
