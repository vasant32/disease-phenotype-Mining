<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of double-lumen balloon catheter-based reperfusion therapy with or without intra-arterial thrombolysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of intracranial arteries were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Gateway balloon catheter was used to disrupt clots or dilate atheromatous plaques in every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The technical details, technique-related complications, recanalization rates, and clinical outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The occlusion sites were internal carotid arteries in 17 patients, M1 segments in 32 patients, the M2 segment in 1 patient, a vertebral artery in 1 patient, and basilar arteries in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (41%) were treated with thrombolysis first, and 20 patients (34%) were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) followed by thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> alone was performed in 15 patients (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean dose of urokinase was 205 x 10 U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extent of recanalization was complete (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> [TIMI] score of 3) in 17 patients (29%), and partial (TIMI 1/2) in 28 patients (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional independence at discharge was preserved in 76%, 25%, and 7% of patients with TIMI 3, TIMI 1/2, and TIMI 0, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A combination of <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and thrombolysis resulted in a significantly higher recanalization rate than <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (12%) experienced hemorrhagic events after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Severe parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> was observed in 2 patients (4%), and vessel rupture was encountered in 1 atherosclerotic case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical angioplasty using a Gateway catheter combined with a low-dose thrombolytic agent is a safe and effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial embolic and atherosclerotic occlusion with a low risk of hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
