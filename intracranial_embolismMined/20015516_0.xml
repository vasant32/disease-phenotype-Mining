<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> may result in reduction of brain perfusion, which limits the ability of the blood stream to wash out emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) is used as a biological marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) have elevated BNP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationships of plasma BNP levels before t-PA infusion and AF with early recanalization after t-PA infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a major brain <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRAs were performed before and within 60 min after t-PA infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationship between BNP levels before t-PA infusion and the presence of AF with early recanalization was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (49 men; mean age, 75.5+/-10.4 years; ICA occlusion in 25 patients, M1 in 32, M2 in 13, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> in 3, and BA in 6) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRA within 60 min after t-PA infusion revealed recanalization in 35 (44.3%) patients and no recanalization in 44 (55.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF (57.1% vs. 75.0%, P=0.0294) and BNP&gt;150pg/dl (39.0% vs. 73.7%, P=0.0019) less frequently had early recanalization than those without AF and with BNP&lt; or =150pg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The combination of AF and BNP&gt;150pg/ml was a useful predictor for no early recanalization (positive predictive value, 79.4%; negative predictive value, 62.2%; sensitivity, 61.4%; specificity, 80.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of AF and elevated BNP was associated with no early recanalization after IV-t-PA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We should need further study to ascertain its predictive ability </plain></SENT>
