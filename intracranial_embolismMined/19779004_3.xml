<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Given the current high quality and usefulness of noninvasive cerebrovascular imaging, invasive angiographic evaluation of the cerebrovascular system is justified if the procedural risk for a neurologic complication is far below the anticipated benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of diagnostic cerebral angiography provided by a dedicated neurointerventional team in a high-volume university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 1715 patients undergoing diagnostic cerebral angiography at our institution from 2000 to 2008 was retrospectively assessed for incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> related to cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients (n = 40) who serendipitously underwent DWI within the first 30 days after cerebral angiography, the presence of new DWI hyperintensities found in territories explored during angiography was tabulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications related to the catheter technique and sheath placement were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or permanent neurologic deficit was seen in any of the 1715 patients undergoing diagnostic neuroangiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonneurologic complications without long-term sequelae occurred in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had punctate areas of restricted diffusion in territories that had been angiographically explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within a high-volume neurointerventional practice, the risk for neurologic complications related to catheter-based diagnostic cerebral angiography can approach zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As the absolute number of invasive diagnostic procedures diminishes with time, diagnostic cerebral angiography remains a useful tool while providing a foundation for neuroendovascular interventions, and should preferably be performed in institutions with high-volume operators also capable of managing unanticipated complicating adverse events </plain></SENT>
