<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and aggregation to the angioplasty site with subsequent embolization seems to plays a major role in early postangioplasty embolization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During this period, asymptomatic embolic signals can be detected in patients by transcranial Doppler ultrasound despite aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">S-nitrosoglutathione</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi>) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi> that appears to have relative platelet specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated its effectiveness in reducing embolization after carotid angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen patients undergoing carotid angioplasty and stenting for symptomatic &gt; or =70% internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were randomized in a double-blind manner to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> or placebo given after surgery for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were pretreated with aspirin and given <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for 24 hours after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler recordings were made from the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery for 1 hour before treatment and at 0 to 3, 6, and 24 hours after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> resulted in a rapid reduction in the frequency of embolic signals of 95% at 0 to 3 hours and 100% at 6 hours (P=0.007 and P=0.01 versus placebo, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, 2 patients experienced ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after the angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No cerebrovascular events occurred in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">S-nitrosoglutathione</z:chebi> was highly effective in rapidly reducing the frequency of embolic signals after endovascular treatment for symptomatic high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
