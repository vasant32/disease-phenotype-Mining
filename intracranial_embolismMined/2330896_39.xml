<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The risk for systemic embolization was studied in 272 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> or prosthetic valves who were referred to the echocardiography laboratory with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 33 months (range less than 1 to 83), 27 (10%) patients had a systemic embolic event, which was cerebral in 23 patients (85%) and peripheral in 4 (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the analysis of individual variables, the risk of embolization was increased by female sex, underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and left atrial size greater than or equal to 4.0 cm, but not by age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or type of AF (paroxysmal vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, left atrial size greater than or equal to 4.0 cm was the single strongest predictor of increased risk for embolization (p less than 0.001), but female sex (p = 0.014) and underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (p = 0.027) also contributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When each of these 3 factors was assigned 1 point in a risk score, embolic events were found to occur in none (0%) of 24 patients with a risk score of 0, in 2 (3%) of 83 patients with a risk score of 1, in 13 (11%) of 118 patients with a risk score of 2 and in 12 (26%) of 47 patients with a risk score of 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The score allows patients with AF and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> to be stratified into high-, medium- and low-risk groups for systemic embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such information could be useful in decision making for anticoagulation in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
