<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> (MA+, n = 8) or without aura (MA-, n = 9) scheduled to undergo transcatheter closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> with Amplatzer <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> occluder devices for paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> were monitored with contrast TCD (DWL, Germany) before, during, and after the procedure to estimate the magnitude of the shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous embolization to the brain was also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were thereafter followed-up at 1, 3, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A composite score of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> severity, which included frequency, duration, and intensity of the attacks in the previous 3 months (range 0-10), was obtained at the time of the procedure and at the follow-up visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete occlusion of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after 1 month in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> score was 6.75 in MA+ and was 6 in MA--patients </plain></SENT>
