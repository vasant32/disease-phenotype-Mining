<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 39-year-old female was referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, disturbance of consciousness and right homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore in the present case there was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) after Colman's criteria </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After removal of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> she became alert without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
