<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in the postoperative period caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in a patient with increased pressure in the pulmonary artery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most frequent postoperative complications were transient atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032805" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-pericardiotomy syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pressures in the pulmonary artery decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, who had increased pressures pre-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients with pulmonary vascular resistance of 6 mmHg/l/min before operation the resistance was significantly reduced postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Residual shunts of less than 30% of the systemic flow were present in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> recurred years after the operation in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up examinations on an average 44 months after operation, 75% had improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 20 cases the heart was reduced in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 6 the heart size was unchanged or larger, in spite of eliminated shunts in 5 of the 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 8 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> before operation, two gained stable sinus rhythm postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that circumclusion is also an effective method in the elderly patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> and that such patients should undergo surgical repair of the defect </plain></SENT>
