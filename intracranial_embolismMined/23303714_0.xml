<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the right hemisphere in whom a left internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> paradoxically protected the ipsilateral hemisphere from distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient also presented multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic embolic lesions in the right middle cerebral artery territory and in the right occipital lobe, which was fed by the posterior cerebral artery, anomally originating from the right carotid siphon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the left internal carotid artery-which showed a severe preexisting stenosis-was occluded by the cardiac clot, whereas the right internal carotid artery only presented a moderate stenosis that had probably allowed the clots to pass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the severe left internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> may have blocked the cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, preventing it from reaching the ipsilateral hemisphere. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
