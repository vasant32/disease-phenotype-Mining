<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We advanced the open stent-grafting technique with a branched endoprosthesis, which reconstructs simultaneously the cervical branches and descending aorta within an acceptably short interval of deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of this new technique and assessed the early and midterm results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2004 to September 2007, the branched open stent-grafting technique was performed in 69 cases (55 men, average age 66.2 years, 36 degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 33 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo>, 13 [18.8%] in emergency, 7 [10.1%] redo cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, the branched endoprosthesis was delivered through the opened proximal aortic arch, and total arch repair was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To avoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, retrograde cerebral perfusion was performed at the end of deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average time of operation, cardiopulmonary bypass, and deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was 417, 130, and 36 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 124 cervical stent grafts were inserted and successfully delivered in 121 (97.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality within 30 days was 3 (4.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major postoperative complications involved 4 (5.8%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 2 (2.9%) spinal cord injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No aorta-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed after discharge from hospital, and the survival was 90.9%, 88.8%, and 88.8% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six (5.0%) cervical stent grafts showed endoleak; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases were successfully treated by additional endovascular repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aortic arch repair with branched open stent grafting is an effective technique with satisfactory early results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In midterm analysis, cervical branch events were acceptably rare and controllable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This technique could be an attractive alternative to conventional total arch replacement </plain></SENT>
