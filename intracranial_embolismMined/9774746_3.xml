<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated leukocyte aggregation by means of the leukergy test and count in 26 patients with atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The evaluation was performed within 24 h from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and then repeated on day 2, 4, 6 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were compared with those of 10 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients were followed until day 30 when a clinical examination and brain computed tomography were performed to evaluate the extent and outcome of cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both leukocyte aggregation and count were significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with respect to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While leukocyte count was not able to differentiate the severity of neurological impairment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, leukocyte aggregation was significantly higher in major than in minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients on days 2 and 4 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, while values of leukocyte count recorded at entry remained substantially stable in the following determinations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, leukocyte aggregation showed a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) on day 4 with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other determinations in major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings show that the extent and temporal profile of changes in leukocyte count and aggregation are different in patients with cerebrovascular disease and suggest an involvement of altered leukocyte rheology in the development of cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
