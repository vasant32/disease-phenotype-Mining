<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The VA lesions in seven patients were complete occlusions, and three patients had severe atherostenosis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent recipient sites of intra-arterial embolism were the intracranial VA-posterior inferior cerebellar artery region (8), and the distal basilar artery (BA) and its superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral artery branches (7) </plain></SENT>
