<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the distribution and frequency of microthromboemboli (MTE) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in humans and determined whether MTE in the contralateral circulation resulted in histological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients dying within the first month after unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> etiology was determined mainly on the pathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole brain sections from the region of maximal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> were stained for fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrin-containing MTE were transferred to a schematic drawing and counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sections from 20 patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> sections had significantly more MTE than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> of thrombotic (n=6) and thromboembolic (n=21) origin had more MTE than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of embolic origin (n=13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had the highest number of MTE within the region assumed to be the ischemic penumbra, other arterial territories, and the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and those with short clinical courses had a higher number of MTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had recent micronecroses in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be a pattern of MTE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that is dependent on cause, size, and clinical duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings of contralateral micronecroses emphasize that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may result in more widespread cerebral injury than clinically expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given the many variables influencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in humans, the results have to be interpreted with caution </plain></SENT>
