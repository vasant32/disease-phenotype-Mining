<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three major clinical challenges have emerged from the first decade of experience: vascular complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and paravalvular leak (PVL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major vascular complications remain common and independently predict major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, transfusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although women are more prone to vascular complications, overall they have better survival than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further predictors of major vascular complications include heavily diseased femoral arteries and operator experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strategies to minimize vascular complications include a multimodal approach and sleeker delivery systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> is very common during TAVR, it mostly is asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> independently predicts prolonged recovery and increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> predictors include functional disability, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a transapical approach, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Embolic protection devices are in development to mitigate the risk of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after TAVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PVL is common and significantly decreases survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Undersizing of the valve prosthesis can be minimized with 3-dimensional imaging by computed tomography or echocardiography to describe the elliptic aortic annulus accurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The formal grading of PVL severity in TAVR is based on its percentage of the circumferential extent of the aortic valve annulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further emerging management strategies for PVL include a repositionable valve prosthesis and transcatheter plugging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The first decade of TAVR has ushered in a new paradigm for the multidisciplinary management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The second decade likely will build on this wave of initial success with further significant innovations </plain></SENT>
