<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of cerebral protection during carotid artery stenting (CAS) using the Mo.Ma device, which prevents cerebral embolization by proximal endovascular blockage of blood flow in the internal and external carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 14 European centers, 157 patients (121 men; mean age 68.0+/-8.3 years) were enrolled in a prospective registry between March 2002 and March 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients had a symptomatic (&gt;50%) or asymptomatic (&gt;70%) stenosis of the internal carotid artery suitable for carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protected carotid stenting was performed with the Mo.Ma system, which occludes both the common and external carotid arteries via 2 independently inflatable compliant low-pressure balloons before any device is advanced across the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood is aspirated through the catheter intermittently or at the end of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The device was successfully positioned and stents were implanted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diameter stenosis was reduced from 84.1%+/-7.8% to 6.7%+/-5.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of flow blockage was 7.6+/-5.9 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 12 (7.6%) patients, transient intolerance to flow blockade was observed, but the procedures were completed successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 124 (79.6%) cases, there was macroscopic evidence of debris after filtering the aspirated blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In-hospital complications included 4 (2.5%) minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 8 (5.1%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, resulting in a 2.5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 30-day follow-up, there was 1 cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 1 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 3 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, for an overall 5.7% 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate and a 30-day major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of 1.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral protection with proximal endovascular blood flow blockage during CAS is feasible, with a high procedural success rate </plain></SENT>
