<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the evolution of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), it is becoming increasing obvious that minimizing microembolization is critical in protecting the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Every component of the CPB circuit and ancillary apparatus must be evaluated and, if necessary, re-engineered with the reduction of microemboli a major focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiotomy suction has been identified as a major source of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>However, is the alternative blood treatment apparatus, the cell saver, capable of reducing the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> embolic load and are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell savers equally efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>In the event that microemboli do make it to the aorta, is it possible to divert them away from the brain to more robust vascular beds through clever design of the aortic cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>Is the venous cannula a source of microgaseous emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The answer is yes to both questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Emboli can be directed away from the brain by the positioning and design of the aortic cannula and the venous cannulae may be a source of gaseous microemboli delivered to the oxygenator by the venous line but careful practice will prevent this type of embolic formation </plain></SENT>
