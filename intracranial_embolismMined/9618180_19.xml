<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are several case reports in the literature where patients have suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> following fat injections into the face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> after injection of various substances into the face is a well-known complication of such interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report two further patients who suffered from ocular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> after fat injections into the face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the intravasation of fat particles there are three preconditions: well-vascularized tissue, fragmentation of parenchyma, and, especially, a local increase in pressure in the affected tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fat injections into the face lead to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> local increase in pressure in highly vascularized tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assume that fragments of fatty tissue reach ocular and cerebral arteries by reversed flow through branches of the carotid arteries after they are introduced into facial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The manifestation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> appears either immediately after the fat injection or after a latency period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>Fat embolism</z:mpath> can remain subclinical and may not be recognized, or the clinical features may be misinterpreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To minimize the risk of such a major complication, fat injections should be performed slowly, with the lowest possible force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One should avoid fat injections into pretraumatized soft tissue, for example, after rhytidectomy, because the risk of intravasation of fat particles may be higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Metabolic disturbances such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> may also contribute to the clinical manifestation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> Routine funduscopic examinations after fat injections into the face could help to provide data for future estimation of the patient's general risk </plain></SENT>
