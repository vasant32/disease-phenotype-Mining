<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study, teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2002, 2235 CEAs were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until April 1999, the intra-operative strategy consisted of standard isolation and dissection of the carotid bifurcation preliminary to ICA clamping (group 1; 1090 interventions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Starting from May 1999, we performed early isolation and clamping of the distal ICA, followed by dissection of the carotid bifurcation and clamping of the external and common carotid artery (group 2; 1145 interventions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The modified technique was feasible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients of group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 2 there was a significantly lower incidence of neurological deficit on waking than in group 1 (0.4% and 1.8%, respectively; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early distal control of the internal carotid artery during CEA is feasible and could contribute to reducing intra-operative neurological events </plain></SENT>
