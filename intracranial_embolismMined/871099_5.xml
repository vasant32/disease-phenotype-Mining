<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients suffered from such complications in the course of the first postoperative month and three of them died, two from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and one from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nineteen late thromboembolic complications developed in 18 of the 164 patients who survived the postoperative period, the incidence bein 5.9 episodes per 100 patients per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two valve types wer found to be equallly thrombogenic, and the rate was not lower than that in patients with Starr-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> aortic ball valves of series 2,300 previously studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Particularly serious was valve malfunction caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> that limited the movement of the discs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early recognition of this condition is essential, because the only effective therapy is removal of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients with a Björk-Shiley and one with a Lillehei-Kaster valve suffered this complecation and two died, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> caused a third late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients who had not received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> developed thromboembolic complications, while most episodes occurred in spite of well-maintained anti-coagulant treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that arterial thromboembolic complications remain a considerable problem also after aortic disc valve implantation, and that thrombotic valve malfunction is particularly serious and requires special attention </plain></SENT>
