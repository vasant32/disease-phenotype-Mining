<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We assessed the relationship between the presence of spontaneous eotrast echoes (SCEs) in left atrium (LA) and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed in 56 patients (36 male, age 69.6 +/- 8.9 yrs.) with non-valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (NVAF), In 37 patients (66.1%), SCEs were detected by TEE, However, SCEs could not be detected in any patients by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients (16.1%), left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were detected by TEE, but they could not be detected by TTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the degree of SCEs, the patients were divided into three groups as follows; Group (-) (n = 19): SCEs were not detectable, Group (mild) (n = 17): SCEs were detectable in part of LA, Group (marked) (n = 20): SCEs were detectable in whole LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were detected in 1 (5%) of the Group (-) patients, 2 (12%) of the Group (mild) patients and 6 (30%) of the Group (marked) patients (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>17 patients had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group (-), only one patient (5%) had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But 4 patients (24%) of Group (mild) and 12 patients (60%) of Group (marked) had histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was significantly higher in Group (marked) than Group (-) (P less than 0.01) and Group (mild) (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in patients with NVAF, the presence of SCEs by TEE may be a useful variable in identifying increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
