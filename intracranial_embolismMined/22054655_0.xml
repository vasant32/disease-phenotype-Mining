<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We reviewed our experience with surgical procedures for infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE) in order to evaluate modern outcomes and objectively examine our institutional preferences, including the use of bioprostheses in intravenous drug users (IVDUs) regardless of age and prompt surgical intervention in patients with either septic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> or active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review of medical records was conducted from February 1999 to November 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Social Security <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index was used to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hospital records were used to identify infectious complications, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were identified as IVDUs and 133 patients as non-IVDUs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival at 30 days, 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years for IVDUs and non-IVDUs was 91.2% versus 93.6%, 77.5% versus 83.0%, 46.7% versus 71.1%, and 41.1% versus 52.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis identified intravenous drug use as an independent risk factor for diminished survival (p=0.03), although not for reoperation (p=0.95) despite 95.3% of IVDUs receiving bioprostheses versus 73.7% of non-IVDUs (p=0.0002, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients were identified as having preoperative septic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>; none had a perioperative hemorrhagic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> approached significance as an independent risk factor for the composite end point of recurrent IE and perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (odds ratio 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.777 to 10.9; p=0.12, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bioprostheses are reasonable for IVDUs undergoing valve replacement for IE regardless of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prompt surgical intervention in the setting of septic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> is justified; in the setting of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> it is less clear </plain></SENT>
