<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined the effects of the noncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801 using a newly developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model of thrombotic distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> under conditions of carefully controlled head temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 1 mg/kg of MK-801 or saline before the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser-activated dye laser (562 nm) was used to cause thrombotic distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In experiments 1 and 2, the single laser beam (20 mW) was separated into three beams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each beam was positioned onto the distal middle cerebral artery at three sites along the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The photosensitizing dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg) was administered intravenously over 2 minutes; the three points were then irradiated for 3 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In experiment 3, higher power of the laser (three separate irradiations using a single beam of 20 mW) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral common carotid artery was occluded permanently, and the contralateral carotid artery was occluded for 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Head temperature was controlled at 36 degrees C in experiment 1 and not controlled in experiments 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three days after the ischemic insult, brains were perfusion-fixed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Head temperature was mildly hypothermic (34-35 degrees C before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, with a further decrease of 1-2 degrees C during the initial 60 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) in experiment 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no differences were observed in head temperature between the MK-801-treated and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in experiment 1 was 89 +/- 29 mm3 (mean +/- SD) in the treated group, which was not different from the control value of 84 +/- 40 mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were smaller (58 +/- 35 mm3 and 54 +/- 14 mm3) in the control groups of experiments 2 and 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, MK-801 also failed to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in experiments 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MK-801 is not effective in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic infarction</z:e> under conditions of either controlled (normothermic) or uncontrolled (mildly hypothermic) head temperature </plain></SENT>
