<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between coffee consumption and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in men at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Coffee intake was observed from 1965 to 1968 in a cohort of men enrolled in the Honolulu Heart Program with follow-up for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> over a 25-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 499 hypertensive men (having systolic or diastolic blood pressures at or above 140 and 90 mm Hg, respectively) in older middle-age (55 to 68 years) when follow-up began </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Past and current cigarette smokers were excluded from follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the course of follow-up, 76 men developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After age-adjustment, risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> increased significantly with increases in coffee consumption (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No relationships were observed with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When adjusted for other factors, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> was more than doubled for men who consumed three cups of coffee per day as compared to nondrinkers of coffee (RR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.2-3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although in need of further confirmation, consumption of coffee appears to be positively associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> in hypertensive men in older middle-age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings suggest that it may be prudent to advise older middle-aged men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who consume large amounts of coffee to consider reducing their coffee intake </plain></SENT>
