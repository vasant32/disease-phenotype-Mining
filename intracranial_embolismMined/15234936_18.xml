<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors examined the relation between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in elderly men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were measured in 2,444 Honolulu Heart Program men aged 71-93 years at the 1991-1993 examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The participants, who were free of prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at baseline, were followed to the end of 1998 for thromboembolic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was unrelated to hemorrhagic events, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> declined consistently with increasing <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a nearly threefold excess of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> in men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels (&lt;1.0 mmol/liter (&lt;40 mg/dl)) compared with men with high levels (&gt; or =1.6 mmol/liter (&gt; or =60 mg/dl)) (10.6/1,000 person-years vs. 3.6/1,000 person-years; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for other risk factors had little effect on these findings, although associations appeared strongest in elderly men with "desirable" total cholesterol levels, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level is inversely related to the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> in elderly men </plain></SENT>
