<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) is associated with cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> has been mainly documented after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk associated with LVD, especially of mild degree, in the general population is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between LVD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in a multiethnic cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LV systolic function was assessed by transthoracic 2-dimensional echocardiography in a subset of subjects from the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS), 270 patients with first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 288 age-, gender- and race-matched community controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV ejection fraction was measured by a simplified cylinder-hemiellipsoid formula, and categorized as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (&gt;50%), mildly (41% to 50%), moderately (31% to 40%) or severely (&lt; or =30%) decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between impaired ejection fraction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was evaluated by logistic regression analysis after adjustment for established <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LVD of any degree was more frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (24.1%) than in controls (4.9%; P&lt;0.0001), as was moderate/severe LVD (13.3% versus 2.4%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A decreased ejection fraction was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> even after adjusting for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio for any degree of LVD was 3.92 (95% CI, 1.93 to 7.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio for mild LVD was 3.96 (95% CI, 1.56 to 10.01) and for moderate/severe LVD 3.88 (95% CI, 1.45 to 10.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association between LVD of any degree and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age, gender and race-ethnicity subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LVD, even of mild degree, is independently associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The assessment of LV function should be considered in the assessment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
