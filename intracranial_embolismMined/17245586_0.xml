<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to identify the cause of CSDH in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In a group of 100 consecutive patients with CSDH diagnosed in our hospital between 1 January 2000 and 31 August 2003, we found nine patients to be younger than 35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These nine were assessed to identify their cause of CSDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a predisposing cause in five of nine patients, three having a disorder of CSF balance, and two having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trauma was reported in only two of these five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the four patients without a predisposing factor a trauma was reported in three of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In only one patient the cause of CSDH remained unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients made a complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> did also occur in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Trauma, CSF imbalance, and deranged clotting increase the risk of CSDH, however this disorder can also occur in the absence of identifiable predisposing factors or trauma </plain></SENT>
