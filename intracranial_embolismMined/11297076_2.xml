<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Posthemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (PHH) is an ominous complication of <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (IVH) in premature infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have correlated lateral intraventricular clot with subsequent PHH, but there are no studies assessing the outcome of clot in the cisterna magna (CM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if the identification of clot in the CM on the initial positive cranial ultrasound for <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> increased the risk of subsequent PHH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of ultrasound records over a 4-year period identified 41 neonates with at least grade 2 IVH who had specific CM views prospectively performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six survived more than 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 22 (61%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the initial positive cranial ultrasound, CM blood was identified in 21 (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 18 (86%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> [odds ratio (OR) 16.5, confidence interval (CI) 2.5-125.7, P &lt; 0.001] and 14 (67%) required intervention or remained dilated (OR 28.0, CI 2.8-1265.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients that required permanent shunt placement had initial CM clot (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> was not a significant predictor of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, but a <z:mp ids='MP_0000827'>dilated third ventricle</z:mp> (&gt; or = 8 mm) was (OR 9.0, CI 1.2-103.3, P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric intraventricular clot filling of more than 50% was not predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, but symmetric clot of more than 50% was (OR 10.8, CI 1.4-61.6, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine neonates had concomitant parenchymal damage with varying outcomes (three shunted, two persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo>, four resolved with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sized ventricles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study CM clot significantly increased the risk and was a better predictor of posthemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> than initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
