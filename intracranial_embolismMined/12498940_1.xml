<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The high variability in presence and signature of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>), detected with transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), cannot be explained with the currently available published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied customized postprocessing on the radiofrequency (RF) signal of a standard TCD system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spatial resolution was on the order of 2 mm, depending only on the length of the ultrasound (US) burst emitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amplitude of clutter-filtered RF signals was color-coded and plotted as a function of time and depth (range 30 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 128 point fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) (50% temporal overlap) were calculated, visualizing both the background Doppler spectrum and the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 122 gaseous <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> from two patients during cardiac surgery and 52 particulate <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> from four patients after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> categories showed comparable properties: they appeared in the RF amplitude plot as rather straight lines of increased intensity, indicating that the velocity remained approximately the same while they passed the US beam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The velocity calculated from the amplitude plot never exceeded that of the background Doppler spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Various "<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> patterns" could be identified with respect to the depth range at which the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A quarter of the gaseous <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> changed their direction at a specific depth, suggesting that the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> entered a branch (e.g., an M2 artery or the anterior cerebral artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the FFT analysis, these <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> contained both positive and negative frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> show consistent signature patterns in the amplitude-time plots and that the previously reported variability of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> appearance in conventional Doppler systems is an artefact caused by relatively large signal amplitudes and sample volumes </plain></SENT>
