<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>Cardiac myxomas</z:hpo> may present clinically with many different features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since highly effective treatments exist, it is important that they are diagnosed quickly in order to avoid further complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the influence of neurological presentation in diagnosis and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have reviewed the clinical charts of 28 patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxomas</z:hpo> seen at our centre in the last 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis in patients with neurological events was 49.22 years and 60.84 years in those without neurological manifestations (p = 0.0325) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most frequent presentations were: cardiac manifestations (92.8%), general manifestations (71.4%) and embolic events (39.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (32.1%) presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>; 7 of whom presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), which was the first manifestation in 6 of them; 3 of them later suffered complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> with sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography confirmed diagnosis in 26 out of 27 patients in which it was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients presented neurological symptoms after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most frequent initial neurological manifestation in our series was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, none of the patients were diagnosed after the first neurological symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the contribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxomas</z:hpo> to the total amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> is low, since surgery is highly effective and of low risk, and patients with neurological manifestations are younger, it is vital to consider the possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxoma</z:hpo> after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> of unknown origin </plain></SENT>
