<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Open heart surgery is associated with a significant risk of cerebral and myocardial dysfunction, which is attributed in part to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> from incompletely deaired cardiac chambers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the impact of carbon dioxide (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>) insufflation to the thoracic cavity, a prospective randomized study was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 62 elective patients were randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> insufflation (group I, n = 31) or control (group II, n = 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the Parsonnet risk score, 16 patients in group I (52%) and 10 patients in group II (32%) were categorized as being at either high risk or extremely high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group II, perioperative mortality was 16.1% (5 patients); in group I, 1 patient died (ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">Creatine</z:chebi> kinase MB isoenzyme, as a marker of myocardial damage, was more elevated in group I after surgery (38.0 +/- 4.1 vs 28.0 +/- 2.1, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitive test scores did not reveal significant postoperative differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although mortality was lower with <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> insufflation, no benefit could be demonstrated for markers of cardiac ischemic damage or neurocognitive outcome in this high-risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> concentrations in the thoracic cavity did not necessarily reach anticipated levels, our method of application is in question </plain></SENT>
