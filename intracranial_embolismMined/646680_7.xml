<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence microscopy disclosed that embolization initially provoked a hyperemic engorgement of both the embolized and nonembolized hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multifocal, blood-brain barrier extravasations occurred throughout the ipsilateral cortex and oral basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> ensued, with migration of extravasations from cortex into the white matter, which initially showed only minimal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Migration and accumulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in white matter, with subsequent uptake and swelling of neuroglia and axons, may be related to secondary white matter damage following cortical embolic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Degenerative foci developed throughout the embolized cortex over the one- to four-hour period of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These sites may correspond to those areas in which hyperemia and damage to the blood-brain barrier was present shortly after embolization </plain></SENT>
