<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine if surface-modifying additive (SMA) cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuits are associated with a lower rate of cerebral microemboli during CPB compared with standard circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a 2 x 2 factorial design, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomized to SMA or standard CPB circuits (with and without <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler was used to detect high-intensity transient signals (HITS) in both middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HITS were counted from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to end of CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervals of interest were as follows: period 1, from CPB <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to aortic cross-clamping; period 2, from aortic cross-clamping to immediately before de-clamping; period 3, from aortic declamping to before aortic side-clamping; period 4, from the application of the aortic side clamp to immediately before the release of the side clamp; period 5, from aortic side clamp release to the end of CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 14 patients in each circuit group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found on the partial and total counts of HITS (medians [25th, 75th percentile]) between patients exposed to standard (total count: 228 HITS [174, 2801) and SMA circuits (total count: 156 HITS [104, 356]; p = .427) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median of the sum of HITS per patient associated with perfusionist interventions was not different between both circuit groups (standard: 17 HITS [7, 80]; SMA: 43 HITS [13, 168]; p = .085) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study, with a sample size of 28 patients, indicates that it is unlikely to find any difference in the count of HITS during CPB that is greater than 117 HITS between the two CPB circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our findings emphasize the relevance of minimizing additional sources of cerebral microembolization during CPB that are not directly related to the biocompatible nature of the SMA CPB circuit </plain></SENT>
