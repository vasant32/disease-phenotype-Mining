<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 760 patients followed for up to five years by our cardiologists with echocardiographically demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP), only one, aged 82 years, has had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, of 43 patients admitted to our neurology service with a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and no evidence of carotid or other cardiac lesion and in whom echocardiography was performed, MVP was present in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No contributing etiologic mechanisms were uncovered to account for the disparity between the cardiology and neurology populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, with the apparent increased incidence of MVP in young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, both groups require longitudinal follow-up to understand better the factors that predispose a small percentage of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
