<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have implemented and evaluated the first online wavelet-based automatic embolic signal-detection system, based on a fast discrete wavelet transform algorithm using the Daubechies 8th order wavelet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was evaluated using a group of middle cerebral artery recordings from 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> patients, and a 1-h compilation tape from patients with particularly small embolic signals, and compared with the most sensitive commercially available software package (FS-1), which is based on a frequency-filtering approach using the Fourier transform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An optimal combination of a sensitivity of 78.4% with a specificity of 77.5% was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its overall performance was slightly below that of FS-1 (sensitivity 86.4% with specificity 85.2%), although it was superior to FS-1 for embolic signals of short duration or low energy (sensitivity 75.2% with specificity 50.5%, compared to a sensitivity of 55.6% and specificity of 55.0% for FS-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study has demonstrated that the fast wavelet transform can be computed online using a standard personal computer (PC), and used in a practical system to detect embolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may be particularly good for detecting short-duration low-energy signals, although a frequency filtering-based approach currently offers a higher sensitivity on an unselected data set </plain></SENT>
