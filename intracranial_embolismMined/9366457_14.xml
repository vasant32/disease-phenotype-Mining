<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Microemboli occur commonly during cardiac surgery in adults, and, when present, increase the risk of neuropsychological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their incidence and significance during correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that microemboli would occur before bypass with right-to-left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001693'>cardiac shunts</z:hpo> and would also occur in large numbers when the aortic crossclamp was released in children during repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 25 children studied with carotid artery Doppler, embolic signals were counted and timed in relation to 13 intraoperative events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as either at high risk (obligate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> or uncorrected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo>) or at low risk (net left-to-right shunt or simple obstructive lesions) for paradoxical (venous to arterial) emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median number of emboli detected was 122 (range, 2-2,664) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-two percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> emboli were detected within 3 min of release of the aortic crossclamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high-risk group had significantly more emboli (median, 66; range, 0-116) during the time interval before cardiopulmonary bypass than did the low-risk group (median, 8; range, 0-73), with P &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the high- and low-risk groups in the total number of emboli detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no apparent association between number of emboli and gross neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microemboli can be detected in the carotid arteries of children undergoing repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and are especially prevalent immediately after release of the aortic crossclamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The role of emboli in causing neurologic injury in children undergoing repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
