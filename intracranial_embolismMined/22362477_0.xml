<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic occlusion of the brachiocephalic trunk (CBT) is a rare clinical entity and its presentation in the form of arterio-arterial embolism is uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early identification of patients with CBT occlusion may have important therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A man aged 49 presents with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> symptoms involving the territory of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emergent transcranial doppler evaluation showed a flow pattern of proximal right M1 occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator administration, partial recanalization of the vessel was found and the patient improved clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cervical and transcranial duplex sonography demonstrated an occlusion in CBT, which was later confirmed on CT angiography and digital angiography of supraaortic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After aorto-innominate bypass, pathological analysis confirmed the atherosclerotic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical presentation of CBT occlusion are transient ischemic symptoms related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal phenomenon</z:e> in the vertebro-basilar territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of carotid circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> usually result from arterio-arterial embolic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early recognition is important for its therapeutic implications, therefore thrombolytic therapy should be indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neurosonologic study allows rapid and reliable examination on hemodynamic status and the presence of distal embolic phenomena </plain></SENT>
