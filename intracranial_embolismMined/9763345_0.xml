<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microcatheters were placed through 6-F guiding catheters into the common carotid arteries of swine for 30-min (short-term) and 90-min (medium-term) periods, with and without systemic heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the end of the placement period the microcatheters were retracted through the guiding catheters and fixed for scanning electron microscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Guiding catheters were harvested after 5 h placement, with and without systemic heparinization, by retraction through 8-F sheaths and fixed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surfaces of both hydrophilic and nonhydrophilic microcatheters <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demonstrated more accumulation of debris during placement without than with systemic heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference was primarily in the amount of fibrillary material on the catheter surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The guiding catheters also demonstrated increased debris accumulation without systemic heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that, even when using relatively nonthrombogenic catheters, systemic heparinization is indicated during cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
