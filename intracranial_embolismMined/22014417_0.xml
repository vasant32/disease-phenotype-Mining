<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The rupture of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> is the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endovascular embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> by implantation of Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC) has become a major treatment approach in the prevention of a rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Implantation of the coils induces formation of tissues over the coils, embolizing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, blood entry into the coiled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> often occurs due to failures in the embolization process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current diagnostic methods used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, such as X-ray angiography and computer tomography, are ineffective for continuous monitoring of the disease and require extremely expensive equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we present a novel technique for wireless monitoring of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> using implanted embolization coils as radiofrequency resonant sensors that detect the blood entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The experiments show that commonly used embolization coils could be utilized as electrical inductors or antennas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the blood flows into a coil-implanted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, parasitic capacitance of the coil is modified because of the difference in permittivity between the blood and the tissues grown around the coil, resulting in a change in the coil's resonant frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The resonances of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> GDC-like coils embedded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> models are detected to show average responses of 224-819 MHz/ml to saline injected into the models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This preliminary demonstration indicates a new possibility in the use of implanted GDC as a wireless sensor for embolization failures, the first step toward realizing long-term, noninvasive, and cost-effective remote monitoring of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with coil embolization </plain></SENT>
