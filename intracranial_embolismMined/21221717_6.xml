<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Formation of a fibrin clot is controlled by a group of tightly regulated plasma proteases and cofactors and a change in the fibrin fiber formation causes an alteration in clot <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This plays an important role during thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study we investigated the ultrastructure of fibrin networks from fifteen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients by using scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clot <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was investigated with and without the addition of human thrombin to the platelet rich plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previously it was shown that, when studying the ultrastructure of fibrin networks, the addition of thrombin is necessary to form an expansive, fully coagulated layer of fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results from the addition of thrombin to the plasma showed thick, matted fibrin fibers and a net covering some of the major fibers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Typical control <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with major thick fibers and minor thin fibers could be seen in some areas in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, without the addition of thrombin, a matted fibrin network still formed, indicating that the factors responsible for the abnormal fibrin <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> are present in the circulating plasma and is the cause of the observed matted, layered <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is not present in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the results obtained we suggest that this changed <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> might be useful in a screening regime to identify the possibility of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or even to follow the progress of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients after treatment </plain></SENT>
