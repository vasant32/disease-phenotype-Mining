<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective study used transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of thoracic aorta intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The influence of risk factors was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally the impact of modifying surgical technique on the outcome was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven-hundred and ninety-two patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were evaluated with TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Depending on the location and extent of thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> various surgical modifications were carried out, e.g. hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> with aortic arch atherectomy, CABG on beating heart and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in this group of patients was determined and analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 114 patients with grade II and III atheromas of aortic arch and ascending aorta in whom surgical modifications were done, none had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in the study group was 0.76%, six patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression identified age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> as important risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> and calcium on chest X-ray (CXR) were identified as important predictors of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative TEE is an invaluable modality for evaluating the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is significant reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate following identification of atheromas and modification of surgical technique </plain></SENT>
