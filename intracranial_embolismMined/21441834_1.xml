<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emboli generated at the time of treatment either using endarterectomy or stent-angioplasty may progress with blood flow and lodge in brain arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the use of protection devices to trap emboli created at the time of revascularization has helped to establish a role for stent-supported angioplasty compared with endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several devices have been developed to reduce or detect emboli that may be dislodged during carotid artery stenting to treat carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant challenge in assessing the efficacy of these devices is precisely determining when emboli are dislodged in real time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To address this challenge, we devised a method of simultaneously recording fluoroscopic images, transcranial Doppler data, vital signs, and digital video of the patient/physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method permits accurate causative analysis and allows procedural events to be precisely correlated to embolic events in real time </plain></SENT>
