<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Right axillary artery (AxA) perfusion, which can prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> caused by retrograde perfusion via the femoral artery (FA), was used for selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) as well as cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in aortic arch repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We review the outcome of aortic arch surgery using SCP with right AxA perfusion to clarify its efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between 1998 and 2002, 120 patients underwent aortic arch repair using SCP with right AxA perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 69+/-10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> were atherosclerotic in 79, dissecting in 32, and others in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty of them (16.7%) required emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CPB was initiated with right AxA and FA perfusion, and following SCP was established using right AxA and left common carotid artery perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With right AxA perfusion, hospital mortality was 5.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed only ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was an independent determinant for hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Permanent neurological dysfunction developed in one patient (0.8%), while seven (5.8%) suffered from temporary one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, SCP time, stenosis of the carotid arteries, past history of cerebrovascular events, and atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were not related to temporary neurological deficits CONCLUSION: Right AxA perfusion in conjunction with SCP is a safe and useful alternative for brain protection in total arch replacement </plain></SENT>
