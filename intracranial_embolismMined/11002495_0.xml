<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An autopsy case of extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo> and a pulsatile mass below the left mandibular angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination showed no obvious deficits except left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0542142" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed narrowing of the original segment of left ICA with dissection and aneurysmal dilation at the level of C3 vertebra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days after admission, the patient had a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of consciousness disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second angiography showed no obvious changes compared with the first findings except slight narrowing in the distal portion above the aneurysmal dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanism was thought to be recanalization following transient occlusion of the left ICA caused by extension of dissection or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial embolism</z:e> due to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He was managed conservatively, but unfortunately he died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic autopsy showed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was fusiform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologically, it demonstrated dissection of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> between the media and adventitia layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> in the atheromatous plaque with disruption of the elastic lamina were observed along with severe degenerative changes of the intima, media and, in part, adventitia layer due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right iliac artery and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> were observed in the systemic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> presumably developed after disruption of a weak portion of the atherosclerotic wall, where intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> be regarded as one of the pathogenic factors capable of causing dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the extracranial ICA in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
