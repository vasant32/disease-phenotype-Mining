<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects showed DAF effects, as measured by increases in response duration and intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While controls showed an increase in DAF effects as a function of increased task difficulty, the brain-damaged patients failed to show such an increase on tasks on which they were presumably impaired (verbal tasks for lefts, nonverbal for rights) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings suggest a clear dissociation between DAF effects in unilateraly lesioned patients due to the nature of the stimulus material and its difficulty level </plain></SENT>
