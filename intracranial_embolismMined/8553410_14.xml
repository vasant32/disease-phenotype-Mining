<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) is the standard technique for monitoring emboli in the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals have been detected with the use of this technique in most patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the majority of emboli are detected after release of aortic cross-clamps and partial occlusion clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we compare the intraoperative use of TCD with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We simultaneously monitored 20 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery with TCD and TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients also underwent routine TEE examination of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Embolic signals were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by both techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean total number of emboli was 535 +/- 109 by TEE compared with 133 +/- 28 by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found correlation between numbers of emboli detected by the two techniques at clamp placement and release (r = .65, P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clamp placement and release accounted for 84% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> emboli by TEE and 83% by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By TEE, large, highly echogenic particles were detected after clamp release compared with small, barely echodense particles at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No such distinction was apparent by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found correlation between severity of aortic atheroma and both TEE- (P = .003) and TCD-detected (P = .009) emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TEE and TCD can both be used to continuously monitor emboli during coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, TEE is invasive and justified only if it is being performed for intraoperative assessment of aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> or cardiac function </plain></SENT>
