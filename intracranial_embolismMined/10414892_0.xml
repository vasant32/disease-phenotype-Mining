<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before one can investigate the pathogenetic role in more detail, reproducible and reliable quantitative methods need to be developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In several previous studies, microemboli detection was performed unilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We questioned if this reflects the bihemispheric embolic load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 42 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection was performed during extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The side-to-side correlation of microembolus counts was strong (0.91), but there was a significant difference in number (p &lt; 0.01) comparing left and right emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The side of higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> counts cannot be predicted in the individual because either side may show higher counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Doubling the unilateral count may deviate from the bilateral count by as much as 51% in the individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total embolic load to the brain during extracorporeal circulation cannot be precisely predicted from unilateral transcranial insonation alone </plain></SENT>
