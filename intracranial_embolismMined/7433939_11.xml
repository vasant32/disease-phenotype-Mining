<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is based upon the direct measurement of the enzyme <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphokinase (CPK) and the brain-specific isoenzyme CPK-B in cerebrospinal fluid of dogs submitted to conventional techniques of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Highly significant elevations occur during a 60 min period of CPB in CSF levels of total CPK and CPK-B isoenzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These elevated levels persist at 24 hours postoperation, despite full clinical recovery in the dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a comparative study of the effects of introducing a 40 micrometer arterial line screen filter during the period of CPB, there was a highly significant reduction in total CPK and CPK-B levels in the filtered group (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
