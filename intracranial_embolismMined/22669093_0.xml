<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS) with endovascular proximal flow blockage is deemed able to reduce the cerebral embolization observed during filter-protected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated clinical outcome and intraoperative embolization rates, measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and transcranial Doppler monitoring, in a series of patients undergoing CAS with proximal flow blockage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 35 consecutive patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> ≥70% were included to undergo CAS with proximal flow blockage, obtained with the Mo.Ma system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent preoperative and postoperative DW-MRI in order to detect new ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 35 patients, 31 (89%) underwent intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring to record the microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) produced during each procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MoMa system was successfully used in 34 patients (technical success: 97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intolerance to balloon occlusion was observed in 4 patients (12%), but never compromised the completion of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or neurological events occurred in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI disclosed 74 new ischemic lesions in 8 patients (8/34, 23.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions except one were ipsilateral to the treated carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures, with a mean number of 33.2±23.2 (range 3-103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 20 procedures (20/31, 65%), <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected also during flow blockage (mean: 9.1±7; range 2-28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While achieving good technical and clinical results, CAS with proximal flow blockage is still accompanied by a non-negligible cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The detection of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during ICA flow blockage suggests the need for a better selection of patients </plain></SENT>
