<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the prognostic value of transcranial Doppler (TCD) microemboli detection regarding clinical events and correlated TCD findings with results of blood cell counts and platelet flow cytometry to gain insight into the composition of circulating microemboli in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a cohort of 42 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> TCD microemboli detection was performed on a single occasion and correlated with thrombembolic events during a prospective follow up of 29.7 +/- 7.3 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, a complete blood count and in 17 patients platelet flow cytometry were performed on the day of the TCD examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) were recorded in 15 (35.7%) patients, however, without any correlation with the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>, blood cell counts, or thrombembolic events [9 (21.4%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> positive and negative patients did not differ regarding the levels of activated platelets, platelet microaggregates, or microparticles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a strong trend for higher rates of platelet-neutrophil conjugates in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> positive patients (P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
