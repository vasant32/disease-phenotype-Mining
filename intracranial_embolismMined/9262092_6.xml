<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical strategies using a deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> to protect the spinal cord or viscera are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From April 1994, 25 patients underwent graft replacement of the entire descending aorta (13 patients) or thoracoabdominal aorta (12 patients) using a deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients had atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 20 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 20 males and 5 females, whose age ranged from 26 to 72 years old, 47 years old in average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery consisted with proximal anastomosis using deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (18 degrees C) with retrograde cerebral perfusion by elevating central venous pressure to 20 mmHg, reconstruction of the intercostal arteries, and distal open anastomosis, while perfusing the brain and heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proximal open anastomosis was used with retrograde cerebral perfusion technique in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Averaged number of reconstructed intercostal arteries was 2.1 for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No early mortality was found and one patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had a postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and one had a delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> 2 days after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> was secondary hypoxemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Utilization of the deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the entire descending aorta or of the thoracoabdominal aorta provided an adequate protection of the spinal cord as well as the abdominal viscera, eliminated clamp injury or cerebral embolization of debris or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, and afforded excellent surgical exposures </plain></SENT>
