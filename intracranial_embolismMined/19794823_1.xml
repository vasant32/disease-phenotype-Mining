<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, different connexin subtypes may play different roles in pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used immunohistochemical analysis to investigate alterations in the expression of connexin subtypes in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven samples, sectioned after brain embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, were used for the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data, evaluated semiquantitatively by computer-assisted densitometry, was compared between the intact hemisphere and ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the coexpression of Cx32 and Cx45 with neuronal markers was significantly increased in ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cx43 expression was significantly increased in the colocalization with astrocytes and relatively increased in the colocalization with neuronal marker in ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Cx32, Cx43, and Cx45 may respond differently to ischemic insult in terms of neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
