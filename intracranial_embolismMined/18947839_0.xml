<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The morphological characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques are considered to determine their cerebral 'embolic potential' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these are seldom considered during therapeutic decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Assessment and quantification of embolic potential by employing power-M-mode (PMD) transcranial Doppler (TCD) to strengthen risk scoring has been discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PMD-TCD is a reliable technique for monitoring of microembolic signals in intracranial arteries and can help in estimating the 'embolic potential' of carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the diffusion-weighted imaging, assessment of neuro-cognitive functions may provide a better assessment of the safety of carotid interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proposed 'risk scoring' system can be further improved by incorporating the cerebral 'embolic potential' by PMD-TCD while cognitive assessments may be used for a more reliable evaluation of the safety of various carotid interventions </plain></SENT>
