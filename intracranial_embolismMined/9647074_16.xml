<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this investigation was to determine the correlation between cerebral microemboli and S100beta levels during cardiac operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure emboli in the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Emboli counts (n = 111) were divided into five time periods: (1) incision to aortic cannulation; (2) aortic cannulation to cross-clamp <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; (3) cross-clamp <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to cross-clamp release; (4) cross-clamp release to decannulation; and (5) decannulation to chest closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of S100beta (n = 156) was measured at baseline, at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, then 150 and 270 minutes after cross-clamp release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The level of S100beta correlated with age, cardiopulmonary bypass time, cross-clamp time, and number of emboli at time period 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although cardiopulmonary bypass time was univariately associated with S100beta level, it became nonsignificant in a multivariable model that included age and cross-clamp time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The correlation of S100beta level with emboli measured during cannulation (time period 2) supports the hypothesis that cannulation is a high-risk time period for cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
