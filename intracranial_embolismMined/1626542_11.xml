<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the early 1980s, a standardized community-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> register was started in three geographic areas in Finland: North Karelia and Kuopio in eastern Finland and Turku/Loimaa in southwestern Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results from the first 3 years, 1983-1985, confirmed the high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was higher in eastern Finland than in the southwestern part of the country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized annual incidence among men aged 25-74 years varied from 206 per 100,000 population in southwestern Finland to 322 per 100,000 population in the province of Kuopio in eastern Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among women aged 25-74, incidence was 119 and 187 per 100,000 population in these two areas, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized male:female ratio in incidence was 1.7, slightly higher than that previously reported in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of 3,574 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events registered, 78% were first events without a history of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>People aged 65-74 years accounted for 45% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events among men and 62% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors' experience shows that the geographic variation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence and attack rates is difficult to assess even within a country with a relatively uniform health care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rigorous standardization and quality control is needed for the assessment of long-term trends; this is the primary goal of the FINMONICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study suggest that the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is still high in Finland, although mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has steeply declined during the past 15-20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> survivors in Finland may actually be increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is high in Finland as compared with other countries, intensified primary and secondary prevention measures are needed to reduce it </plain></SENT>
