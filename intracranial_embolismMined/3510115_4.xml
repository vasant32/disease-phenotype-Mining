<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary indication for its use is venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> where an average 20,000 to 40,000 USP units are initially administered by constant infusion over 24 hours to prevent extension of an established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequent treatment is based on the therapeutic response, usually monitored by a global clotting test such as the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromogenic assay based on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-induced inhibition of activated factor X (Xa) is a particularly useful alternative monitoring test where <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> complicates pregnancy or is associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> has also been used for the primary treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> but is more frequently used either for primary or secondary prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary prophylaxis schedules usually employ a low dose (5000 units) administered 8- or 12-hourly without <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> control, but a titrated subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> regimen has been successfully reported in elective hip surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> is primarily initiated by platelet aggregates forming in vivo, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is commonly administered for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> including peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and repeated transient cerebral ischaemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The potential efficacy of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in disseminated intravascular consumption (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) remains to be firmly established, but is indicated where symptomatic thrombotic complications occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and haemorrhagic side effects may complicate <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy, but <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications may be minimised with the development of modified low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> which is currently undergoing clinical trial </plain></SENT>
