<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of an intravenous infusion of low-dose native tissue plasminogen activator for distal embolisms in the middle cerebral artery divisions or branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients were selected according to the following computed tomographic and angiographic criteria and treated with intravenous infusion of 7.2 mg of tisokinase: 1) no early ischemic changes on the initial computed tomographic scan, and 2) embolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery divisions or branches without the involvement of the lenticulostriate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparison, the records of 12 patients from previous years who met the above inclusion criteria but underwent no thrombolytic therapy were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of neurological recovery was assessed using the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale at 24 hours after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major neurological improvement was defined as a decrease in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> score by 4 points or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scores at the time of admission between the treatment group (mean +/- standard deviation, 12.8 +/- 2.8) and the untreated group (14.0 +/- 2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group, major neurological improvement was seen in 17 (85%) of 20 patients, whereas in the untreated group only 5 (41.7%) of 12 patients showed major neurological improvement (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean score at 24 hours in the treatment group (3.6 +/- 3.5) was significantly lower than that in the untreated group (9.4 +/- 7.3) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no hemorrhagic complication with neurological exacerbation in the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even with delayed initiation (&gt;3 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>), intravenous infusion of low-dose tisokinase may be safe and effective for small distal emboli in the middle cerebral artery divisions or branches, when early ischemic changes on computed tomographic scans and involvement of the lenticulostriate arteries are absent </plain></SENT>
