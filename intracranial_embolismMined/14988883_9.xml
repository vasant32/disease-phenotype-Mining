<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the possible beneficial effect of the PercuSurge GuardWire cerebral protection device based on balloon occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery and debris <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> for patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 268 CAS procedures were attempted under cerebral protection using the PercuSurge GuardWire system in 242 patients (194 men; mean age, 71.2 +/- 9.4 years; range, 40-91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions were mainly atherosclerotic; 64% were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Technical success was 99.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were stented except three postangioplasty restenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic occlusion during balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and stenting was well tolerated in 255 patients (95.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microscopic analysis of the aspirated blood showed different types of particles numbering between 7 and 145 per procedure, with a mean diameter of 250 microm (mean, 56-2,652 microm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 2.3%, with four periprocedural complications at &lt; 48 hr (one <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>), one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> at 3 days, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> at 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This technique appears safe and efficient with a low rate of periprocedural embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Protection devices seem indispensable to perform CAS and expand the applicability of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Randomized studies (surgery vs. CAS with and without cerebral protection) are awaited </plain></SENT>
