<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> using a target International Normalized Ratio (INR) range of 1.7 to 2.5 is efficacious for many clinical indications, but the minimal intensity of anticoagulation required for antithrombotic protection has yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether patients could be reliably monitored with a less intense regimen, we anticoagulated patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for several months using a target INR range of 1.3 to 1.6 as determined by prothrombin time (PT) using a sensitive thromboplastin (Dade IS, International Sensitivity Index [ISI] = 1.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma measurements of F1+2, a marker of factor Xa action on prothrombin in vivo, were also obtained to determine the suppressive effect of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> on hemostatic system activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 20 of 21 patients with a history of cerebrovascular events (mean age, 61 years) could be reliably regulated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in the target INR range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>F1+2 levels were significantly suppressed from baseline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with a mean reduction of 49% (range, 28% to 78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a significant relationship between the extent of suppression of prothrombin activation levels and the baseline measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mean reduction of 65% was observed for those patients with baseline F1+2 greater than or equal to 1.5 nmol/L, but only 38% for baseline F1+2 less than or equal to 0.5 nmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 68% of plasma samples obtained during stable anticoagulation were within the target INR range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PTs were also determined on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plasma samples with two thromboplastins of lower sensitivity (C+, ISI = 2.09; and automated simplastin, ISI = 2.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 47% and 35% of PT determinations, respectively, were within the target range with these reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that prothrombin activation can be significantly suppressed in vivo with use of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in an INR range of 1.3 to 1.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This level of anticoagulation can be reliably achieved by monitoring PTs with a thromboplastin of high sensitivity </plain></SENT>
