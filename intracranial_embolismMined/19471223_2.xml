<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound scanning (EAS) for preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The intraoperative EAS was used to evaluate the ascending aorta in 909 consecutive CABG patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the scanning documented more than 3 mm of atheromatous thickness or plaque in the ascending aorta, we never manipulated it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore 196 patients (21.6%) underwent off-pump CABG using composite grafts (85 cases, 9.4%) or in situ grafts (111 cases, 12.2%) with no aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ascending aorta was confirmed to be free from significant atheromatous plaque by the EAS in 713 patients (78.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On-pump CABG was performed using aortic cannulation and total aortic clamping in 429 patients (47.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Off-pump CABG with aortocoronary bypass grafts was performed using side-bite aortic clamping in 165 cases (18.2%) or the other anastomotic devices in 63 cases (6.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were five hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0.6%) but no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative coronary angiography revealed 98.8% (1,659/1,680) of the patency of the bypassed grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It was suggested that the application of aortic clamping or cardiopulmonary bypass was not a risk factor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> when the ascending aorta was evaluated using the EAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the application of aortic clamping with free grafts may provide eligible bypass graft patterns, leading to sufficient graft patency </plain></SENT>
