<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Femoral artery cannulation and retrograde arterial perfusion have been postulated to increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the impact of the arterial cannulation site on the perioperative results after proximal aortic surgery is evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1996 and December 2002, a total of 327 patients underwent proximal aortic repair for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> non-dissected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The arterial inflow was established by cannulation of the aortic arch (group A) or the femoral artery (group F) in 166 and 161 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The early 30-day mortality was 0.9% (3 patients [1 patient in group A and 2 patients in group F]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of early focal neurologic dysfunction (permanent and transient) was 4% (13 patients) and there was no significant difference between the two groups (4.2% vs 3.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to an intraoperative injury of the arterial wall, there were 6 repairs (3.6%) of the aortic arch in group A and 1 repair (0.6%) of the femoral artery in group F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The univariable examination of preoperative and intraoperative variables demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003982'>increased cholesterol level</z:mp> could be possible independent risk factors for neurologic morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the following stepwise logistic regression, only the preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> was identified as an independent predictor for postoperative focal neurologic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The arterial inflow via the femoral artery and the subsequent retrograde perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass do not increase the risk of neurologic complications in patients who undergo proximal aortic repair due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> non-dissected <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because there is an increased risk of aortic wall injury during cannulation, the femoral artery seems to be more suitable in these cases for cannulation than the proximal aorta </plain></SENT>
