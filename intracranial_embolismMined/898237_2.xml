<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was occluded inside the sealed cranium and changes in the superficial cortical vasculature were related to measurements of intracranial pressure (ICP), measured extradurally, and to the resulting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular changes early after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion were not predictive of the outcome of the occlusion, except for aggregation of formed elements of the blood in arterioles, which was a bad prognostic sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary reactive hyperemia was not beneficial; increases of ICP suggested that hyperemia led to increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> as well as to swelling </plain></SENT>
