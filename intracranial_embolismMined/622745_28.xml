<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An opportunity to study cerebrovascular changes in sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (SCA) presented itself when a black child with this disorder died of bihemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular disease</z:hpo> involving primarily the circle of Willis and major bifurcations of both internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Collateral circulation to the distal branches of the internal carotid arteries occurred through transdural anastomoses from the external carotid system and via the leptomeningeal route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perfusion of the basal ganglia was accomplished by vessels arising from the proximal internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes resembled those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsy showed old and recent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two vascular processes were responsible for the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp>: (1) exuberant intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, and (2) old and recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> with partial recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The former has been described only once before in SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small vessels in the basal ganglia were exceptionally numerous and dilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> within large cerebral arteries may be responsible for infarction and small vessel prliferation in basal ganglia in patients with SCA </plain></SENT>
