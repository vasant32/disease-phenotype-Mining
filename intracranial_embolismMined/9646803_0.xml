<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the frequency and characteristics of small <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> with atypical appearances on magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies (n = 117) obtained at 1.5 T of small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (&lt; 1 cm diameter) were prospectively and retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Signal intensity characteristics and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhancement patterns in 84 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (62 patients) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was confirmed at angiography or at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A characteristic signal void was seen on 62 (53%) of 117 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the remaining 55 (47%) studies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had atypical signal intensity that was isointense, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, or hyperintense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were seen on 27 (53%) of 51 gadolinium-enhanced studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging characteristics were seen in roughly half of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These atypical-appearing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may erroneously be considered to be thrombosed or be mistaken for other common lesions such as small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and be dismissed as nonvascular </plain></SENT>
