<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was occluded at its origin via subtemporal approach by microsurgical technique in 24 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 8 of these 24 dogs, end-to-side anastomosis between the maxillary artery and a branch of the middle cerebral artery (MA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis) was made 4 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 5 dogs, MA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis was performed under microscopic control 3 weeks after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remaining 11 dogs without shunt operation were used as control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the animals were clinically observed every day until sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control animals, common carotid angiography was performed between the 2nd and the 5th postoperative weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treated animals were studied by selective external carotid angiography 2 weeks after MA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After sacrifice, transcarotid perfusion with 10% formalin solution was carried out and the brain was carefully removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each brain was additionally fixed in 10% formalin, sectioned, stained and examined pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the control animals showed mild to severe neurological deficits or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the animals with patent bypass in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage demonstrated no neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gross and microscopic evaluation of the brains showed that the permanent occlusion produced a medium or large-sized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, and the patent prompt bypass usually caused no or only microscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the patent delayed bypass, the size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> seemed smaller than that in the untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was found in treated animals with either prompt or delayed bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In general, it seemed that the animals with patent bypass fared better than untreated animals both clinically and pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The experimental data suggest that reestablishment of blood flow by extra-intracranial anastomosis, particularly within 4 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, may lead to a significant restoration of neurological function without pathological damage of the brain </plain></SENT>
