<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To dynamically investigate the long-term response of an ischemic lesion in rat brain to the administration of sildenafil, male Wistar rats subjected to embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were treated with sildenafil (n=11) or saline (n=10) at a dose of 10 mg/kg administered subcutaneously 24-h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and daily for an additional 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance images were acquired and functional performance was measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals at 1 day, 2 days and weekly for 6 weeks post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were sacrificed 6 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and endothelial barrier antigen immunostaining was employed for morphological analysis and quantification of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Map-ISODATA was computed from T(1), T(2) and T(1sat) maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ISODATA derived tissue signatures characterize the degree of ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the map-ISODATA calculated at 6 weeks, the ischemic lesion for each animal was divided into two specific regions, the ischemic boundary and ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The temporal profiles of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and tissue signature were retrospectively tracked in these two regions and were compared with histological evaluation and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 1 week of sildenafil treatment, the ischemic lesion exhibited two significantly different regions, with higher CBF level and correspondingly, lower tissue signature value in the boundary region than in the core region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sildenafil treatment did not significantly reduce the lesion size, but did enhance <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional performance was significantly increased after sildenafil treatment compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administration of sildenafil to rats with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> enhances <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and selectively increases the CBF level in the ischemic boundary, and improves neurological functional recovery compared to saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
