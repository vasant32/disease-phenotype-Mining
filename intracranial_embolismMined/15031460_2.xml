<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> infarction and 27 patients (29 eyes) with asymptomatic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a transcranial Doppler study and noninvasive imaging of the cervical internal carotid arteries (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) ipsilateral to the affected eye was monitored for 30 minutes for microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>), which were saved and analyzed offline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-matched controls (n=15) had no history of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, &lt;50% ICA stenosis, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ophthalmologic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 0/15 (0%) controls, 11/37 (30%) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> in the symptomatic group (P=0.02), and 3/29 (10%) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> in the asymptomatic group (P=0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of 11 (82%) symptomatic eyes with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> had ipsilateral ICA stenosis of &gt; or =50%, as compared with 0/3 (0%) eyes in the asymptomatic group with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and ICA stenosis of &gt;50% were present in 9/37 (24%) cases in the symptomatic and in 0/29 (0%) cases of the asymptomatic group (P=0.0036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency and potential source of cerebral microemboli in symptomatic and asymptomatic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism are different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli are more frequent in symptomatic patients and are associated with ICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
