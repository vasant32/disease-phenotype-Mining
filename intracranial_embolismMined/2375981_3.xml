<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case study is reported of an aphasic patient, RB, who showed frequent form-related whole-word substitutions in oral naming, writing to dictation, and reading aloud </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both written language tasks, the abstractness of the targets influenced the number of formal errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In oral naming, a high proportion of formal paraphasias was related to the intended words in both form and meaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison between targets and formal paraphasias indicated a high agreement both in word class, number of syllables, stress pattern, and in basic (stressed) vowels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The agreement in consonants (including word-initial consonants), however, was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is argued that RB's formal substitutions are not caused solely by errors of lexical selection but that semantic, lexical, and segmental factors contribute to the error outcome </plain></SENT>
