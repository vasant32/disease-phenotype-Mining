<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cardiac catheterization is an important and frequent diagnostic intervention in children, but few systematic studies have explored the associated venous thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have prospectively evaluated the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, diagnosed by ultrasonography, in children catheterized at our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 50 children with weight greater than seven kilograms for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the femoral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic anticoagulation was given to half of the children who were to undergo left-sided catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enrolled children had ultrasonography of the site of puncture the day before, and the day after, the cardiac catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During catheterization, blood samples were taken from 33 of the children for analysis of thrombophilic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The children, with a median age of 34 months, had been catheterized 103 times, comprising the 50 current and 53 previous procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over the course of the current procedure, interventions of various types were performed in 18 children (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed thrombophilic predispositions in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the thrombophilic tendencies, and a high frequency of interventions, we did not encounter a single case of femoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nor did we find any evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that catheterization procedures in children are currently associated with a low prevalence of femoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Continuous assessment of vascular complications, nonetheless, is still required to prevent late effects, and to ensure the best quality of cardiac catheterisations in children </plain></SENT>
