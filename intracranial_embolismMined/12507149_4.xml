<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occipital bone anomalies rarely cause rotational VA occlusion, and patients with nontraumatic intermittent occlusion of the VA usually present with compromised vertebrobasilar flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 34-year-old man suffered three embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the vertebrobasilar system within 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the vertebrobasilar territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography performed immediately after the third attack displayed an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in the right posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiographic and three-dimensional computerized tomography bone images exhibited an anomalous osseous process of the occipital bone projecting to the posterior arch of the atlas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dynamic angiography indicated complete occlusion of the left VA between the osseous process and the posterior arch while the patient's head was turned to the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical decompression of the VA resulted in complete resolution of rotational occlusion of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An occipital bone anomaly can cause rotational VA occlusion at the craniovertebral junction in patients who present with repeated embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> resulting from injury to the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
