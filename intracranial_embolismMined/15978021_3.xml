<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This experiment was designed to determine the consequences of microvascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on the cortical cholinergic input system and associated attention capacities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Injections of microspheres ( approximately 50 microm diameter; approximately 5000 microspheres/100 microL) into the right common carotid artery of rats served as a model of microvascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and resulted in decreases in the density of cholinergic fibers in the ipsilateral medial prefrontal cortex and frontoparietal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, dense <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp>, indicated by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry, was observed in the globus pallidus, including the areas of origin of cholinergic projections to the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluoro-Jade B staining indicated that loss of neurons in the cortex was restricted to areas of microsphere-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Attentional performance was assessed using an operant sustained attention task; performance in this task was previously demonstrated to reflect the integrity and activity of the cortical cholinergic input system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Embolized animals' performance was characterized by a decrease in the animals' ability to detect signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their performance in non-signal trials remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The residual density of cholinergic axons in prefrontal and frontoparietal areas correlated with the animals' performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present data support the hypothesis that microvascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> results in loss of cortical cholinergic inputs and impairs associated attentional performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microsphere embolism represents a useful animal model for studying the role of interactions between microvascular disorder and impaired forebrain cholinergic neurotransmission in the manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
