<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is one of the most severe causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disability and the spectrum of its neurological complications is diverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a 10-years retrospective study of 709 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> diagnosis from the National Institute of Cardiology "Ignacio Ch√°vez" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Data Bank from 1991 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Derived from this information, only the cases with RHD were selected along with those with a perfectly defined profile for cardioembolic mechanism, according to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral Embolism</z:e> Task Force on Cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We selected 250 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients; 163 of these cases (65.2%) presented cardioembolism criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association was more frequent in women (126/77.3%) than in men (37/22.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average age was of 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The damage to valves in RHD was: DML with predominance of stenosis, 88/54%; MI, 56/34.3%; AVL, 19/11.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was the most commonly associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of mechanical prosthetic mitral valves was of 59/36.19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensor-motor syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023015" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">language disorders</z:e> were the most common clinical neurological consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our country, RHD continues being one of the most frequent causes of severe disability, specially when is associated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in young people </plain></SENT>
