<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have developed a minimally invasive model of photothrombotic occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery in rats and have evaluated the patterns and features of the resulting histopathologic injury in two normotensive strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Food-deprived male Sprague-Dawley (n = 14) and Wistar (n = 10) rats anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>/nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> underwent a small craniotomy to expose the right distal middle cerebral artery just above the rhinal fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were injected intravenously with the photosensitizing dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>, and the distal middle cerebral artery was irradiated with light from an <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser-activated dye laser at three separate points to induce thrombotic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral common carotid artery was then permanently occluded, and the contralateral common carotid artery was occluded for 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three days later, the brains were perfusion-fixed and prepared for histopathologic examination, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined by quantitative planimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Sprague-Dawley rats, a large consistent temporoparietal cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was observed; mean +/- SD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 130.5 +/- 40.0 mm3 (coefficient of variation, 30.7%) and a relatively small adjacent zone of selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> ("incomplete infarction"), amounting to only 9.1% of the total injury volume, was also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, Wistar rats had smaller and more variable cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (volume, 48.4 +/- 26.9 mm3; coefficient of variation, 55.6%) but displayed a much more substantial zone of incomplete cortical infarction (volume, 20.8 +/- 10.1 mm3; 30.1% of the total injury volume) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In neither strain was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size related to alterations of blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both strains, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were limited to the cortex, typically involving the parietal cortex, somatosensory cortex, and forelimb region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three rats exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This model has the advantages of necessitating only minimal surgery, allowing the dura to remain intact, and avoiding mechanical trauma to the brain surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In Sprague-Dawley rats, the resulting large cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> exhibited relatively small interanimal variation, making the model suitable, for example, for replicate studies of pharmacotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In Wistar rats, the large zone of incomplete infarction, a unique feature heretofore undescribed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> of permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, lends the model to the study of the pathomechanisms underlying graded cortical ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
