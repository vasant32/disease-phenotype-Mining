<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by occlusion of the unilateral common carotid artery (CCA) in mongolian gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed at set times ranging from 6 to 96 hours after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 6 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, swelling of perivascular astrocytic processes was seen, although there were no obvious changes in the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12 hours, perivascular glial swelling became more prominent and narrowing of the microvascular lumen was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 or 48 hours, an irregular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface with endothelial projections was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes may have had some influence on the brain microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 96 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the cytoplasm of the endothelium appeared granular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was occasionally observed on the exposed basement membrane of those microvessels whose endothelium had been exfoliated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the present study, exfoliation of endothelium was thought to have caused the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, promoting further microcirculatory disturbance and consequent progress of the brain damage </plain></SENT>
