<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002408'>cerebral arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) is yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that angiogenic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>, in particular in partially embolized lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate the expression of angiogenic and proliferative factors in relation to different clinical conditions and treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed for 145 consecutive cases of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specimens were stained with antibodies against VEGF, bFGF, Ki 67, CD 34 and CD 31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression was correlated with clinical presentation (haemorrhage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or other symptoms), <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> localization, size, eloquence and venous drainage, as well as with preoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Whereas no correlation was found between the expression of angiogenic factors and different clinical conditions, we observed a significantly increased proliferation activity as shown by Ki 67 expression in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (p = 0.02) and in patients with preoperative embolization (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased proliferation activity in partially embolized <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> supports a 'no-touch' strategy and clinical observation in high-risk <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> and demands complete <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> elimination in treatable lesions </plain></SENT>
