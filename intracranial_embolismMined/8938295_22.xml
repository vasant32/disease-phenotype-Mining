<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report our experience using intraarterial thrombolysis in the treatment of vertebrobasilar occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with 13 angiographically proved thromboses of the vertebrobasilar system underwent local intraarterial thrombolysis with urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiographic and clinical outcomes were analyzed with respect to clinical examination at presentation, <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> patterns, and time to recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall mortality was 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization could not be achieved in 3 of 13 treatments; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom recanalization failed died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 60% in those patients in whom recanalization was successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> at the time of therapy uniformly predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were two cases each of bilateral proximal vertebral occlusions and midbasilar occlusions and nine cases of bilateral distal vertebral occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were three cases of fatal rethrombosis after initial successful thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate in the recanalized group before rethrombosis was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were two fatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recanalization of the vertebrobasilar system is necessary but not sufficient for effective treatment of vertebrobasilar occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The site of occlusion may help predict angiographic and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Time to initiation of thrombolysis is not an invariable correlate of survival, although clinical condition at presentation may be </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Rethrombosis and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> are significant problems affecting mortality after successful thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
