<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are limited data on small thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> as a possible cause of ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients are reported who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and in whom the initial imaging studies showed a small (&lt;10 mm), unruptured, partially thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each case, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location was confirmed by a conventional angiogram </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of middle cerebral artery embolic event was thought to be related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, causing subsequent embolization into distal related vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of these patients had craniotomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping; one was managed conservatively with medical therapy alone </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Medical management is often decided on an individual basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment mostly involves aneurysmal clipping rather than coiling </plain></SENT>
