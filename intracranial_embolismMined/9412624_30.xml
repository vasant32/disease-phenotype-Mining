<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> with multiple actions that include <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is inactivated by a plasma enzyme, PAF acetylhydrolase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of this enzyme in plasma is caused by a missense mutation in the gene (Val279--&gt;Phe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have studied a possible association of this mutation with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied 120 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 134 patients matched for age and sex with minor complaints but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was analyzed for the mutant allele by a specific polymerase-chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma PAF acetylhydrolase activity was determined by the method of Stafforini et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of the mutant gene was 43.4% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (39.2% heterozygotes and 4.2% homozygotes), which was significantly higher than the 25.4% in control subjects (22.4% heterozygotes and 3.0% homozygotes) (chi 2 = 9.22, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence was slightly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> than those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, but the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients with family histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had a slightly higher but not a significant prevalence of the mutant gene as compared with those without family histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Plasma PAF acetylhydrolase activity was higher in patients than in control subjects, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, or patients with a heterozygous genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that plasma PAF acetylhydrolase deficiency may be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may explain the relatively high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Japan, as the mutation is more common among Japanese than Caucasians </plain></SENT>
