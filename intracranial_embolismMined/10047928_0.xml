<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Toward this end, nicaraven was selected for this study because it has been shown to specifically scavenge <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> that are implicated in platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten healthy volunteers and 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antiplatelet activities in vitro of nicaraven were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of nicaraven tested were 3.50 x 10(-5) mol/L, 1.75 x 10(-4) mol/L, 3.50 x 10(-4) mol/L, and 1.75 x 10(-3) mol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum aggregation rate induced by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) was significantly inhibited by nicaraven at concentration ranges of 3.50 x 10(-4) mol/L or higher in the healthy volunteer platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum aggregation rate induced by collagen was significantly inhibited by 1.75 x 10(-3) mol/L of nicaraven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using platelets from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, the maximum aggregation rate induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> was significantly inhibited by 1.75 x 10(-3) mol/L of nicaraven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the maximum aggregation rate induced by collagen were significantly reduced by 1.75 x 10(-3) mol/L of nicaraven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nicaraven induces dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in both healthy volunteers and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
