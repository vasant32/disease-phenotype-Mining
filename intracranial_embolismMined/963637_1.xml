<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the intellectual performance of patients with Alzeheimer's disease (AD) and multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MID) using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For reliability and generality purposes two independent samples of patients were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in Education Level (EDU) and Performance IQ (PIQ) were obtained for the first sample, with the AD group having a significantly higher EDU level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MID group obtained a higher PIQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the second sample, but EDU level approached significance with the AD group again having a higher EDU level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A discriminant function analysis classified 81% of the patients in the first sample and 100% diagnostic accuracy was obtained for the second sample using the 11 predictor variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A maximum R2 stepwise regression was performed in order to detect the "best" model of variables discriminating between the diagnostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the first sample the "best" model was the two variable model, including EDU and Full Scale IQ, accounting for 40% of the variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The simplest model for the second sample was the one variable model including EDU, accounting for 20% of the variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Quantitative differences were found between the AD samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Time since <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease was offered as a possible influence in the quantitative differences in the AD samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sampling biases in the behavioral study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Successful replication was obtained </plain></SENT>
