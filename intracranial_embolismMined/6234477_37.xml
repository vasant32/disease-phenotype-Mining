<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal syndrome</z:e> of various severity due to either proximal subclavian stenoses (10 cases) or subclavian occlusion (2 cases) were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Olbert's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> catheters were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occlusions could neither be recanalized by the transfemoral nor transaxillary approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one right-sided subclavian stenosis an additional distal subclavian occlusion prevented proper placement of the catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the other patients were treated successfully with no re-occlusion during a follow-up period of 1 to 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient, a transient embolic occlusion of the finger arteries was seen following post-interventional repeat angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before, during and after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>, continuous ultrasound monitoring of the homolateral vertebral flow patterns revealed an unexpected "delay" phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite sufficient recanalization of the proximal subclavian artery, the flow direction within the vertebral artery did not immediately change to antegrade but rather did so gradually within 20 s up to several minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This delay of flow-reversal is thought to serve as a protective mechanism against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during, and shortly after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> of the subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relying on Doppler ultrasound findings, a staging of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal</z:e> is proposed in order to allow adequate selection of patients for <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
