<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These distinctly rare <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> arise preferentially in the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, they often present symptoms of both, intramural and intracavitary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> in addition to general <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, recurrent breast pain, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As shown in the present case, with growing intracavitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> masses the risk for peripheral arterial including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, in most patients with symptoms of systemic arterial embolism of unknown origin performance of transesophageal echocardiography seems advisible, which is presently the most convenient noninvasive imaging method to exclude or to identify intracardiac sources of emboli, irrespective of their type </plain></SENT>
