<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze their effects on the incidence of new diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions as surrogate markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in important subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: DWI was performed immediately before and after CAS in 68 patients with and 175 without protection, and patients were further subdivided according to their age or symptom status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of patients with new ipsilateral DWI lesion(s) was significantly lower after protected versus unprotected CAS (52% versus 68%), as well as in symptomatic patients (56% versus 74%) or those at or younger than 75 years of age (46% versus 67%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the total number of lesions was significantly lower after protected versus unprotected CAS (median, 1; interquartile range [IQR], 0-2; versus median, 1; IQR 0-4.75) and in symptomatic patients (median, 1; IQR, 0-3; versus median, 2; IQR, 0-6) or those at or younger than 75 years of age (median, 0; IQR, 0-2; versus median, 1; IQR, 0-4; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for asymptomatic patients (48% versus 52%; P = .8; median, 0; IQR, 0-2; versus median, 1; IQR, 0-2.5; P = .6) or those older than 75 years of age (73% versus 69%; P = .7; median, 1; IQR, 0-4; versus median, 1.5; IQR, 0-5.75; P = .6), the proportion of patients with new lesion(s) and the total number of these lesions were not significantly different between protected and unprotected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of distal filter devices generally reduces the incidence of new DWI lesions; however, this beneficial effect might not necessarily pertain to older and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
