<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the importance of individual factors to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi>) risk, the authors performed a hospital-based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety cases (56 men and 34 women, ages 15 to 65) discharged from the hospital between January 1981 and December 1984 with a diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi> supported by computed tomography were matched to 174 control patients (106 men and 68 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on potential risk factors were obtained from the medical record and telephone interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate analysis, three variables were significantly associated with <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi> risk: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-6.0), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR = 4.0; 95% CI 2.0-8.3), and smoking (OR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were also analyzed using a direct risk assessment method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This analysis describes the risk in patients with any one factor compared with patients without any of the factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The direct estimates of risk increased by 71% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR = 5.8), 28% for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR = 5.1), and 90% for smoking (OR = 3.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and smoking are the major risk factors for <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi> in patients 65 years old or younger </plain></SENT>
