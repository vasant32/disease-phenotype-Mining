<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We propose the theory that prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> involves three phases: (1) the initial muscular contraction of the arterial wall; (2) a secondary injury to the artery that consists of endothelial desquamation with adherence of platelets to te denuded internal elastic lamina and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> formation; and (3) the repair process, which is the proliferative endarteropathy that has been observed in autopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> can be the end product of any of these three conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have postulated a possible subcycle in the overall scheme by which adherence of platelets to the denuded internal elastic lamina of the artery provide a continuously replenishing supply of spasmogenic chemical factors to the mural receptors and stimulate prolonged contraction of the muscular layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that this cycle may be interrupted by the administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, the records of 112 consecutive patients who received systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in conjunction with carotid ligation were compared with the results of carotid ligation reported in the Cooperative Study, in which <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was not used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of ischemic complications in the group of patients receiving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was 6%, as compared to 23% in control group, with a concomitant reduction in mortality from 16% to 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was slightly less in the patients receiving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> than in patients in the Cooperative Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the data provide support for our hypothesis of the mechanism of prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and that systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> may be used with relative safety in patients in whom the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> if protected by partial carotid ligation </plain></SENT>
