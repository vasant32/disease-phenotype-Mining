<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To decrease the incidence of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) during support with the Novacor left ventricular assist system (LVAS), an expanded <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (ePTFE) inflow conduit has been developed and introduced clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using clinical data from Europe and Canada, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence of embolic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> with the ePTFE inflow conduit (n=88) in comparison with the previously used polyester inflow conduits (n=310, including Vascutek n=155 and Cooley n=155) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated freedom from embolic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, risk reduction for embolic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, and linearized rates of embolic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant decrease in the incidence of embolic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> was demonstrated with the ePTFE conduit (ePTFE 10% vs polyester 23%, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis of freedom from embolic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> at 180 days after implantation was 86% for the ePTFE group vs 72% for the polyester group (log-rank test, 0.0185) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found an associated risk reduction of 55% in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> occurrence in the ePTFE group when compared with the Polyester group (hazard ratio, 0.445; 95% confidence limit, 0.222-0.890; p=0.0221) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linearized <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> rates also were decreased at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time intervals after implantation in the ePTFE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary clinical results with the newly introduced ePTFE inflow conduit provide compelling evidence that the ePTFE conduit material significantly decreases thromboembolic complications during mechanical circulatory support with the Novacor LVAS </plain></SENT>
