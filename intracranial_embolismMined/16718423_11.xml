<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This self-expanding cylindrical nitinol mesh cage with high radial strength allows a chance of relocation until properly positioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is preferred to coils or balloons because a large caliber of feeding artery implied high risk of uncontrollable distal embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There appear to be no reports in the literature concerning use of this device, which could represent a useful innovative tool in embolotherapies, especially in large vascular areas </plain></SENT>
