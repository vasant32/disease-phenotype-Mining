<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Haemostatic activation markers were measured in 52 patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 32 with atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 54 with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and compared with 23 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (&lt; or = 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> (8-28 days) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (&gt; or = 29 days) phases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, D-dimer and alpha 2-antiplasmin-plasmin complex levels were higher during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phases, while thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels were higher during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase than in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, fibrinopeptide A was increased during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phases, thrombin-antithrombin III complexes were higher during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase and D-dimer levels were higher during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein C activity was lower during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase than in atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein C antigen was lower during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase than in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and controls and during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase than in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only D-dimer levels were higher in atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients than controls during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phases and no significant alterations in these markers were observed in the patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that measurement of molecular markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis may be useful for detecting intracardiac thrombin and plasmin generation in patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
