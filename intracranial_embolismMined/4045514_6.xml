<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The injection of a silver or gold ball into the internal carotid artery caused occlusion predominantly of the middle cerebral artery and/or its branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the moment when embolization took place, the characteristic signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> occurred in the electroencephalogram, local cerebral blood flow and steady (DC) potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several hours after the ball had been injected the extent of the focal lesions became recognizable on sections stained for myelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure is simple, rapid, inexpensive and practically always successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of the lesion may be influenced by the change of both the ball size and the posture of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the site of occlusion is easily discernible both on radiographs and to the naked eye </plain></SENT>
