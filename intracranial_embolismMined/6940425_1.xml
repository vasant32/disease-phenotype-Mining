<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They received one gm. of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> daily, then the dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> was reduced gradually and the drug discontinued on average five weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six arterial embolic episodes occurred in five patients, the incidence being 14.5 complications per 100 patients per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five emboli were cerebral, none of them serious, and one was removed from a femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of the embolic episodes occurred in three of the 11 patients with continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, probably from venus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> that developed in the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of only two embolic complications in the 66 patients with sinus rhythm suggests some prevention of arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation on the prosthetic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> is inferior to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, while it may represent an alternative to anticoagulation in individuals with sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We prefer, however, the combined therapy in patients with aortic valve prostheses because of the strong anti-thrombotic effect achieved by this treatment </plain></SENT>
