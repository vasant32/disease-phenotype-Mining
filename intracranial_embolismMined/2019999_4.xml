<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by injecting 680 microspheres with a diameter of 48 microns into the right internal carotid artery of the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After ensuring the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the first day after the operation, the rats were treated with intraperitoneal injections of 15 mg/kg naftidrofuryl oxalate twice a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The behavioral and metabolic changes of operated rats were monitored up to the 5th day after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The symptoms gradually faded away, from the 3rd day on, after microsphere-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> greatly increased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, suggesting embolism-induced inhibition of glycolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To elucidate which steps in the glycolytic catabolism are inhibited after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, biochemical activities of the glycolytic enzymes in the Embden-Meyerhof pathway and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> cycle were determined on the 3rd day after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enzyme activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> kinase were not inhibited, but rather increased slightly after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Malate dehydrogenase activity in the brain mitochondria was markedly increased after microsphere-embolism, whereas other enzyme activities in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> cycle were never inhibited by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of naftidrofuryl resulted in an appreciable reverse of the brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> levels and a substantial recovery of altered enzyme activities to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in the Embden-Meyerhof pathway and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
