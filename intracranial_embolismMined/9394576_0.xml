<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed cases with brain damage after surgery for thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> in our institution and investigated the causes, risk-factors and preventive measures for this disastrous postoperative complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Irreversible brain damage was a complication in 25 out of 184 operative cases (13.6%) over a 21-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cause of brain damage was determined to be embolism by manipulation of the aorta in six cases, clamping of the left subclavian artery in four cases, technical problems of separate cerebral perfusion (SCP) in four cases, severe shock in three cases, embolism unrelated to operative maneuver in three cases, stenosis of a branch of the arch with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in two cases, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> with insufficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and hypoperfusion of a temporary bypass to the left carotid artery in one case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological symptom improved in eight cases and was unchanged in 17 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen cases died in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, age (p = 0.048), a portion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (p = 0.035), preoperative brain complication (p = 0.003), emergency operation (p = 0.033) and clamping of the arch (p = 0.001) were found to be prominent risk factors for brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, clamping of the arch (p = 0.0310), SCP (p = 0.0327) and emergency operation (p = 0.0223) were prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To prevent postoperative brain damage, the arch should not be clamped, appropriate operative techniques to avoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and to shorten SCP time should be employed, and proper and prompt management of the emergency operation and caution in clamping the left subclavian artery are considered to be necessary </plain></SENT>
