<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The impact of aortic manipulation on incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVAs</z:chebi>) was evaluated in patients who underwent myocardial revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1988 to December 2000, 4,875 patients had coronary operations; 33 who survived less than 24 hours and 19 who had aortic cannulation without cross-clamping were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the degree of aortic manipulation, patients were divided into two groups: group A, aortic cannulation, cross-clamping, with (A1, n = 597) or without (A2, n = 2,233) side-clamping, and group B, with (B1, n = 460) or without (B2, n = 1,533) side-clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in group A (n = 2,830) were operated on with and patients in group B (n = 1,993) were operated on without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to identify independent predictors of higher incidence of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (1.0%) had a postoperative <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, 24 early and 25 delayed, with a 30-day mortality of 34.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> predictors were low output syndrome, presence of extracoronary vasculopathy, conversion from off to on pump, and any aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This latter risk factor was significant in patients with extracoronary vasculopathy, but not in patients without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Side-clamping was not a risk factor in patients operated on with CPB, but it was in no-CPB cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in group B1 had the same <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> incidence as patients in group A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore CPB, per se, was not a risk factor for higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic manipulation must be avoided in patients with extracoronary vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Maintenance of a good hemodynamic status is crucial for any patient to reduce <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with extracoronary vasculopathy are at higher risk, and a correct surgical strategy should be tailored for each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In no-CPB cases use of side-clamping provides the same <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> risk as in patients in whom CPB, aortic cannulation, and cross-clamping were used </plain></SENT>
