<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A preplanned investigation program and strict criteria for diagnosis and treatment were followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> or haemorrhage often died very early during the hospital period and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to complications increased significantly during the second week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis regarding mortality showed that a low neurological score and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were the most important factors for the short-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, ambulatory capacity and ECG-diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo> added significantly to the prognostic power of the neurological score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 227 patients discharged alive, 1 and 2-yr mortality was 14 and 18% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, the most important long-term prognostic factors were age and ST changes on the ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Again, considering only patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (N = 190), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo> was found to be the single most useful predictive factor </plain></SENT>
