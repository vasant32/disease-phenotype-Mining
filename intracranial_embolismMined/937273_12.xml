<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a review of 768 consecutive autopsies, 21 (2.7%) clinically unsuspected cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) syndrome were diagnosed by histologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> was diagnosed by the presence of fibrin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in arterioles, capillaries, venules, and medium-sized veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were found, in the descending order of frequency, in the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, adrenals, spleen and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients had multiple visceral involvement, with three showing fibrin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in as many as ten organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The density of fibrin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> was greatest in the spleen, followed by kidneys, liver, lungs, adrenals, brain, and heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A review of clinical data showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were the most common underlying conditions in 13 cases, including nine with positive <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> cultures from blood or cerebrospinal fluid, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that, despite increasing clinical recognition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, a great number of patients remain unsuspected of having the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> syndrome prior to postmortem examination </plain></SENT>
