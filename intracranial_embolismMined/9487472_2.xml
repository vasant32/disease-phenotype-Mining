<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> who were discovered to have retained left atrial catheter as a cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These radiolucent catheters, placed during previous cardiac surgery, were used for perioperative left atrial monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fracture of the catheter occurred during percutaneous removal after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent identification was established by transesophageal echocardiography, which demonstrated a characteristic appearance of the catheter remnant within the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent reoperation to remove the retained catheter and have had no recurrent embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although uncommon, retained catheter in the left atrium is an important potential source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis can be easily made with transesophageal echocardiography and should prompt surgical extraction of the catheter </plain></SENT>
