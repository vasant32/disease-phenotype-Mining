<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic episodes distal to an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to look for evidence of transhemispheric passage of embolic material in this patient category as a mechanism for embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven symptomatic patients with unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and contralateral stenosis were examined by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography with 2-MHz probe (average monitoring time, 2.5 hours per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both middle cerebral arteries and (if present) the reverse-flow anterior cerebral artery ipsilateral to the occluded internal carotid were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients were reexamined 1 month after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Embolic signals were detected in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to the stenosed internal carotid artery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients and in the opposite middle cerebral artery in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these four patients, a reverse-flow anterior cerebral artery was observed in which embolic signals were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No embolic signals were detected after surgery in any of the three patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transhemispheric passage of embolic material occurs in patients with unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and contralateral stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endarterectomy of the stenosed internal carotid artery may eliminate the detected embolic signals in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography could be used as a diagnostic tool to identify the embolic source in patients with unilateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
