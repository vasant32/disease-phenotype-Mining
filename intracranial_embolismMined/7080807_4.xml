<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lateropulsion of the horizontal and vertical refixation saccades was a rather regular finding, especially in complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112602" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular deviation</z:e> after elimination of fixation was present in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tonic lateral vector was always directed to the involved side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that ocular lateropulsion is an easily elicited sign with a lateralizing value in lateral bulbar infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further systematic search of ocular lateropulsion in other posterior fossa disorders is needed to determine its topographical significance </plain></SENT>
