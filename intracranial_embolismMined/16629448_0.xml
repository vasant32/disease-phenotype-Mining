<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 45-year-old woman, who had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> for 12 years, had three attacks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> over two months and died after the final attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intensive clinical laboratory investigations did not disclose any specific origins of emboli, but an autopsy revealed a nodule at the base of the aortic valve which was pathologically proved to be a rheumatoid nodule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were present from the distal part of left internal carotid artery up to the proximal part of the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were rich in fiber, but poorly organized endothelial cell, raising the possibility that they originated from other parts and have recently reached there </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the top of the rheumatoid nodule, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was easily ablated and a small amount of fibrin stuck the nodule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we concluded that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> were originally generated at the top of a rheumatoid nodule in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with RA, rheumatoid nodules are rarely seen in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If present, they usually cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, and seldom result in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first case in which an autopsy proved rheumatoid nodule in the heart which had caused multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We should consider the possibility of rheumatoid nodules in the heart as an origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
