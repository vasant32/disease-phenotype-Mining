<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is an infrequent condition with a large variety of causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in 20% to 35% of cases, no cause is found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied coagulation parameters, including activated protein C resistance associated with factor V gene mutation (factor V Leiden) and anticardiolipin antibodies, in a large series of patients with CVT with or without identified cause or risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients (30 women and 10 men) aged 19 to 71 years (mean age, 36.2 years) with CVT diagnosed by angiography and/or MRI were studied 1 to 18 years after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No known cause was found in 10 idiopathic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coagulation studies included the following tests: fibrinogen, antithrombin, protein C, protein S, plasminogen, anticardiolipin antibodies, activated protein C resistance, and factor V Leiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (15%) were found: 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, 1 protein S deficiency, and 4 activated protein C resistance with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584984" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 1 case (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>) was found in the group of 10 patients with idiopathic CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the other 5, there was another cause or risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients (8%) had increased anticardiolipin antibodies: 1 with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> and 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>; 2 of these 3 patients also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although present in a number of CVT cases, acquired (anticardiolipin) or congenital varieties of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (factor V Leiden being the most frequent) are almost invariably associated with other predisposing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that (1) these abnormalities should be looked for in patients with CVT, whether a cause is found or not, and (2) their presence should not deter the search for other potential causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The detection of such abnormalities has major practical consequences on the long-term management of patients to prevent further thrombotic episodes </plain></SENT>
