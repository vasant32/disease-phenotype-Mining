<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The defect was closed by a 17-mm Rashkind occluder without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six months later no residual shunt was detected and no further neurological event had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates the feasibility of non-operative closure of those defects </plain></SENT>
