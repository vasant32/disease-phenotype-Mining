<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: The covered stent tested is made of nitinol, coated with a <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi> membrane (MembraX trade mark; porous size 80 micro m) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a bench-top model (flow-rate 650 ml/min, pulsatile flow [dicrote] 123 Pulses/min, pressure 100/60 mm Hg [mean pressure 80 mmHg]) with inserted human carotid (n = 6) stent implantation was performed (8/32 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Passed particles (mg) were determined in the effluent of a 100 micro m filter prior to intervention, after stent deployment and after final dilation (5 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When stenting carotid arteries obtained from human cadavers, the highest rate of particle embolization was measured while crossing the lesion with the delivery device (6,8 mg; for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0,05), embolization after additional balloon angioplasty and particle rates measured in the effluent filter prior covered stent placement were significantly lower (3,8 mg; p &lt; 0,05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Branches of the external carotid artery remained patent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The introduced concept of covered stent protected carotid angioplasty with the MembraX trade mark prototype has proven promising results for low cerebral embolization rates ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further evaluations using an animal model and a miniaturization of the delivery device are warranted prior to human use </plain></SENT>
