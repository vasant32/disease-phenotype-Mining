<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid angiography is associated with a 1% risk of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) has shown cerebral microemboli during carotid angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine their significance, we correlated the number of microemboli during angiography with clinical characteristics, angiography findings, and preangiography and postangiography cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One middle cerebral artery was monitored with TCD in 24 patients during angiography for carotid territory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of microemboli was correlated with angiographic and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted cerebral MRI was performed before and &lt; or = 48 hours after angiography, and the number of new ischemic lesions was determined in a blinded review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microemboli were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with an average of 51 per procedure (range, 12 to 154) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of microemboli had signal characteristics typical of air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of the 24 patients had both preangiography and postangiography MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of 24 patients had an angiographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with a single new thalamic lesion on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No other patient had a new lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The microembolus count correlated with the angiographic contrast volume (P &lt; .001) but not with any other radiological or clinical characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the presence of numerous cerebral microemboli during carotid angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The microembolic signal characteristics and the correlation with contrast volume indicate that introduced air is the cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These microemboli are usually clinically silent and do not lead to new changes on cerebral MRI </plain></SENT>
