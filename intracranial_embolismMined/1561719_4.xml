<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of prophylactic and therapeutic administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> combined with hyperbaric treatment in anesthetized dogs that were subjected to carotid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> and a brief episode of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess recovery we measured somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) amplitude, intracranial pressure, brain water, and cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups were studied: pre-air treatment (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> 1 mg/kg 3-4 h before carotid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>, and 1 mg/kg immediately after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>); post-air treatment (2 mg/kg immediately after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>); and control (equivalent volumes of saline pre- and post-air) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a slight improvement in SSEP early in the course of hyperbaric therapy in the pre-air treated group; the post-air group never differed from control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences in intracranial pressure or brain water were found among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No blood flows below those lethal to neurons occurred in treated animals but 4 of 7 control animals had low flows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although prophylactic treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> produces some improvement in recovery, we cannot confirm that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> is an effective adjunct to recompression when administered therapeutically </plain></SENT>
