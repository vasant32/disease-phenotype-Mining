<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Air micro-emboli originating from the oxygenator have been postulated as one source of cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since controversy still exists regarding the merits of bubble versus membrane oxygenators, this has prompted investigators to devise methods to determine the amount of micro-emboli produced during CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, 27 patients undergoing CPB surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (21) or valve replacement (6) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgical and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> techniques were standardised in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except for the type of oxygenator used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A bubble oxygenator was used in 17 patients (Bentley Bio-10, William Harvey or Dideco) and a membrane oxygenator with a 25 microns filter in the remaining 10 patients (Bentley <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BOS</z:e> CM50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcranial pulsed Doppler ultrasound was used to obtain blood velocity signals from the middle cerebral artery throughout CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A flow disturbance index (FDI) was defined which provided a representative index of the number of micro-emboli passing the ultrasound transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The FDI indicated the presence of gaseous micro-emboli during insertion of the aortic cannula in 22 of the 27 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 17 patients with a bubble oxygenator, the FDI ranged from 4-39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the 10 patients with a membrane oxygenator, the FDI was always 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Variation of gas flow rates in 3 patients with bubble oxygenators showed a change in the FDI from 4 +/- 4 at a flow rate of 2 l/min to 17 +/- 9 at 5 l/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
