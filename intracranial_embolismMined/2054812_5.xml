<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed the features of a partially thrombosed giant middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo>, located deep in the left lentiform region and compressing the basal ganglia and the mesencephalon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The angiogram confirmed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and its origin from the main trunk of the artery with occlusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A direct approach was unsuitable for the treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, so an embolization procedure to occlude the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the waiting period, the patient improved and became asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI showed complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and eventually, reduction in its size and mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hemiathetosis may have been the result of direct pressure on the basal ganglia by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous intra-aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may have been due to the massive size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and its narrow neck </plain></SENT>
