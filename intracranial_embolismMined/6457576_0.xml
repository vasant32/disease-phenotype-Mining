<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to reduce operative mortality by effective myocardial protection (coronary perfusion with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>) and to improve long-term results by the optimal choice of valve prosthesis and, in particular, by the systematic use of xenografts for tricuspid valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty TVR were performed between 1970 and 1977 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bj√∂rk-Shiley prostheses were used for aortic valve replacement, Starr <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> 6120 valves for mitral valve replacement and xenografts (7 aortic valve and 13 Hancock xenografts) for tricuspid valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This series represented 3.2% of the total number of valve replacements carried out during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average postoperative follow-up was 52.6 +/- 15.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient died in the first postoperative month (early mortality 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 2 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, one from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and one from accidental causes; the actuarial 5 year survival rate was 87.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen long-term survivors were studied; 6 were functionally improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant (p less than 0.02) but moderate regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormal auscultatory findings in the tricuspid area were found in 64.7% of survivors, and signs of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001708'>right ventricular failure</z:hpo> were elicited in 30.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no early or late complications due to the tricuspid valve xenograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had cardiac catheterisation over one year after operation: right atrial and mean pulmonary artery pressures were significantly reduced (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01 respectively); there was a moderate increase in cardiac index( p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Late clinical complications were rare, only one regressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Triple valve replacement, when necessary, carried a limited early postoperative risk, and satisfactory functional and haemodynamic results may be obtained in the long term </plain></SENT>
