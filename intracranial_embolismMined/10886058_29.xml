<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the results of implantation were evaluated in patients supported with one type of device, including 85 supported with a Thoratec, 61 with a Novacor, and 37 with a HeartMate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean support time was 49, 148, and 124 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful transplantation and weaning rates were 64 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>7% with Thoratec, 59.0% with Novacor, and 62.0% with HeartMate </plain></SENT>
