<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> is caused by red, white, or mixed clots, the emboli previously used in animal studies on thrombolysis were more often red than white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because this might be one of the reasons why thrombolysis is less effective in patients than in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we developed a new method of preparing highly standardized red and fibrin-rich white emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The middle cerebral artery of 20 rabbits was embolized with either red or fibrin-rich white autologous emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion was monitored by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Red emboli consisted of closely packed erythrocytes within a sparse fibrin net and white emboli of a dense mass of fibrin with only few other blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were 26+/-4% (mean+/-SD) of the ischemic hemisphere with red and 27+/-6% with white emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative regional cerebral blood volume dropped below 50% 90 minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> with either type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late spontaneous lysis and hemorrhagic complications occurred in 37.5% of red but not in white <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Emboli prepared by our technique result in standardized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Size and composition of the emboli continuously can be adjusted according to the experimental requirements </plain></SENT>
