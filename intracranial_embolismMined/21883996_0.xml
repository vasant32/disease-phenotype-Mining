<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Aspirin resistance may be linked to increased risk of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate whether it was associated with presence of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>), a readily measurable marker of increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, in those with internal carotid artery (ICA) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied patients with significant ICA disease who were compliant with aspirin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed monitoring for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and measured aspirin resistance status, using the platelet function analyzer (<z:chebi fb="95" ids="53371">PFA</z:chebi>)-100 and Verify-Now systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared frequency of aspirin resistance between patients with and without <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and assessed agreement between the different platelet function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We recruited 62 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most (53, 85.5%) had symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> and 16 (25.8%) had <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of aspirin resistance on at least one test was 25.8% (16 patients), with 13 (21%) resistant on <z:chebi fb="95" ids="53371">PFA</z:chebi>-100 testing, 8 (12.9%) using the Verify-Now system and 5 (8.1%) resistant on both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aspirin resistance was more common in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (50% compared to 17.4% without, P= 0.018 on Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Agreement between the platelet function tests was moderate (ะบ= 0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aspirin resistance appears more common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> who have <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> compared to those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further work should aim to establish whether screening for aspirin resistance and subsequent adjustment to antiplatelet therapy reduces the rate of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
