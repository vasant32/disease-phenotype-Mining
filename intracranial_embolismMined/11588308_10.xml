<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to assess in outpatients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and oral anticoagulation (1) whether the complication rate is influenced by the presence of the risk factors age &gt;65 years, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; (2) whether the complication rate is influenced by the number of additional drugs taken by patients; and (3) whether problems and interventions differ between patients with or without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS:- Clinical characteristics, drugs, problems, interventions, and complications were registered during 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:- Three hundred sixty patients (mean age, 68 years; 43% female) were observed for 383 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients aged &gt;65 years had more serious, life-threatening, or fatal complications (11% versus 5.3%/100 patient-years; P=0.0428) than younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had more life-threatening and fatal complications (2.8% versus 0.6%/100 patient-years; P=0.0354) than patients without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complication rate did not differ regarding the presence of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who took &lt;/=3 drugs had fewer complications than patients who took more (4.3% versus 24.4%/100 patient-years; P=0.0041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with complications complained more of chest (48% versus 28%/100 patient-years; P=0.0113) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (30% versus 13%/100 patient-years; P=0.0057), more frequently failed to keep appointments (134% versus 107%/100 patient-years; P=0.0321), had a higher tracking rate (134% versus 105%/100 patient-years; P=0.0272), and took more additional drugs (4.6 versus 3.5 drugs per day; P=0.0063) than patients with no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:- Patients with increased age or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> or those who take &gt;3 drugs per day have an increased complication rate and thus need especially careful monitoring of oral anticoagulation, including adequate pain control </plain></SENT>
