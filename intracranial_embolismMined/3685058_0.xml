<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage, embolized rats showed no significant change in emotional behavior, but exhibited an increase in ambulation in the open-field test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats with cerebral embolization exhibited marked impairment of the response was observed at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a two-way active avoidance task, embolized rats showed accelerated acquisition of the avoidance response in comparison with a sham-operated control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage, embolized rats exhibited marked impairment of light-dark discrimination learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> was also observed in embolized rats, as demonstrated by a significant decrease in initial correct responses and an increase in total errors in the radial maze task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon microscopic examination, multi-focal necroses were detected in several brain regions, being particularly obvious in the hippocampus and internal capsule of the embolized hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that embolized rats show definite impairment of memory and learning at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage, and suggest that the impairment may be qualitatively different from that observed at the early stage </plain></SENT>
