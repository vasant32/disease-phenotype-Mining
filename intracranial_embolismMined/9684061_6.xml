<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler sonography has become a widely used method for detecting cerebral circulating microemboli (ME) arising from the carotid arteries or the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, studies on subgroups of patients with distinct cardiac sources of embolism are still limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same holds true for investigation on the relationship between microembolization and hemorheological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 142 patients suffering from left <z:hpo ids='HP_0006698'>ventricular aneurysm</z:hpo> (LVA, n = 52), severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVD, n = 43), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF, n = 47) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been neurologically asymptomatic for at least 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further relevant embolic disorders of the carotid arteries and the heart had been excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unilateral monitoring for ME over the middle cerebral artery was performed for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood was drawn after each monitoring for determination of plasmatic coagulation parameters, as well as plasma viscosity, and platelet reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of ME was 31%, with a slightly higher prevalence in patients with LVA (37%) compared to patients suffering from AF (30%) or LVD (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With single-factor analysis, a trend towards higher ME prevalences was found with (a) a history of remote embolic events, (b) ineffective anticoagulation, (c) <z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>increased platelet aggregation</z:mp>, or (d) increased plasma viscosity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &gt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination of ineffective anticoagulation in conjunction with <z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>increased platelet aggregation</z:mp>, however, was significantly associated with higher ME rates even after adjustment for other factors by logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate a low ongoing microembolic activity in asymptomatic patients suffering from LVA, LVD and AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An activated plasmatic coagulation system together with <z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>increased platelet aggregation</z:mp> contributes to ME generation </plain></SENT>
