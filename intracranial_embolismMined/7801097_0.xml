<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The qualitative analysis by ear should be replaced by quantitative measurement techniques to provide results that are cross-comparable to the ones of other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Algorithms for ME detection have been developed and implemented on a Doppler signal analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three quantitative criteria were established with test data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tape recordings of 44 middle cerebral arteries from an ongoing study including patients before and after implantation of prosthetic heart valves were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were first corrected for frequency response, phase and amplitude and examined by two independent investigators and by the instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the 44 measurements both examinations by ear found the same 26 samples to contain zero audible ME signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The instrument detected in 21 cases zero ME signals, in 4 cases 1 signal and in 1 case 4 signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For 18 tapes the ear-method provided counts of 1 to 160 ME's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 12 cases the two investigators got the same result, in the remaining 6 cases the higher of both figures was selected for comparison to the automated count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The counting by the instrument was exactly the same for 7 cases, in 7 cases the instrument counted more, in 4 cases it detected fewer ME signals compared to the reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The method and the proposed detection criteria provided more false positive than false negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This appeared to be due to artifact detection and on higher resolution in time leading to better separation of double events compared to the ear method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Assuming an adequate quality of the quadrature signals, the method may lead to automatic screening for ME signals </plain></SENT>
