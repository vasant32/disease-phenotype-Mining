<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lp(a) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> plays an important part in atherothrombogenesis and is considered an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role in cerebrovascular disease remains unclear, in particular because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether elevated Lp(a) is more frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> related to atherothrombosis than in other etiologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the close structural homology between Lp(a) and plasminogen, we also studied the role of plasminogen in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and whether there is a dependency on Lp(a) plasma levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lp(a) levels and plasminogen activity were measured in 253 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and in 63 controls (CS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were established according to the TOAST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median Lp(a) levels were found to be higher in the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> group and in patients with large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LAA) when compared with CS (20.9 and 22.0 mg/dl, respectively, vs. 16.0 mg/dl; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, elevated Lp(a) levels &gt;30 mg/dl were more frequent among the LAA subgroup than among CS (39.4 vs. 11.1%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean plasminogen activity was lower in the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> group (110.8 vs. 120.3%; p &lt; 0.001) and in patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (109.8 vs. 120.3%; p &lt; 0.05) when compared with CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between Lp(a) levels and plasminogen activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that elevated Lp(a) is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and especially for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> caused by LAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low plasminogen activity may play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease, especially for the development of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
