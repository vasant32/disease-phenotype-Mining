<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, current techniques to discriminate between signals from emboli and artifacts are subjective and ambiguous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The radiofrequency (RF) signal provides an extra dimension to the information available from conventional TCD systems that may help to interpret complex events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Artifacts generated by healthy volunteers and embolic signals recorded from a flow phantom were used to characterize the appearance of the two types of event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of events, recorded during and immediately after carotid endarterectomy surgery, were compared with those from known sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional information was provided by the RF signal on events recorded during TCD monitoring thus aiding classification </plain></SENT>
