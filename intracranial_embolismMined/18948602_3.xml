<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Embolic events have long been thought to occur in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumors</z:e> secondary to embolization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> fragments; however, there are no large studies examining the epidemiology and occurrence of embolism in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1957 to 2006, 323 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary cardiac tumors</z:e> were treated surgically at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, patients who experienced an embolic event included 80 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> 31 [9.7%], <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> 30 [9.3%], and other 19 [6%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with no history of an embolic event (n=243 [75%]) were defined as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age was similar between the case and control groups (mean 54.5 versus 53.9 years, P=0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate logistic regression model including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histology, and cerebrovascular risk factors, indicated that left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (OR, 1.95; P=0.04), aortic valve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (OR, 4.17; P=0.002), and smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden (OR, 2.20; P=0.01) were the most significant factors in the occurrence of embolism (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (OR, 0.12; P=0.006) and decreased functional status (New York Heart Association III/IV; OR, 0.31; P&lt;0.001) were protective against the occurrence of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was obtained in 82% at a mean follow-up time of 6.17+/-6.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no recurrent embolic events at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated no difference in survival between both groups (P=0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve and left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have the greatest anatomic risk for embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, minimal symptomatology, and no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> have a high risk of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cardiac tumors</z:e> can be resected with low early mortality, and late survival after operation in the context of an embolic event is similar to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumors</z:e> who undergo resection for other indications </plain></SENT>
