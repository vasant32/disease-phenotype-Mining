<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This prospective study investigates the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>), venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> (VAE) and paradoxical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> (PAE) by transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) in neurosurgical patients operated on in the sitting position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of PAE after exclusion of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> is assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was identified by pre-operative TOE and VAE and PAE by continuous intraoperative TOE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients were divided into two groups, 22 patients were studied in group 1 (posterior fossa surgery) and group 2 (cervical surgery) contained 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative TOE demonstrated a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in 5 of the 22 patients in group 1 (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with proven <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> were excluded from the sitting position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two further patients of this group (12% of 17 patients), in whom a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> had been excluded pre-operatively, nevertheless had PAE, air occurring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cavities of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group 2 the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was 4 out of 40 patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No PAE was observed in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three morphological types of VAE with different haemodynamic and ventilation changes were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VAE was observed in 76% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> posterior fossa operations and in 25% of cervical laminectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a pre-operative search for <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> is mandatory considering its incidence of 23% in group 1 and of 10% in group 2, and the risk of PAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> is detected, the sitting position should be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A residual risk for PAE remains despite exclusion of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> because the reliability of TOE is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TOE is the method of choice for detecting VAE and PAE </plain></SENT>
