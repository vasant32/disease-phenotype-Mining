<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of those carotid bifurcations showing ulceration at surgery, 60% were diagnosed as having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> at angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Half of the remaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> occurred in smooth, benign-appearing plaques and were too small to be seen at angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An incorrect angiographic diagnosis of ulceration was made in 17 of 50 carotid arteries; in most cases this was due to the presence of a subintimal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the wall of the artery </plain></SENT>
