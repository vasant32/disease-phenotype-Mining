<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goal was to identify the delays involved in diagnosing pediatric arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS), a major cause of morbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neonates (&lt;or=28 days of age) and children with a first presentation of radiologically confirmed AIS between June 1993 and January 2006 were identified retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time to diagnosis of AIS (ie, time from clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to radiologic confirmation) was calculated, and factors influencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> diagnosis were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 107 patients (19 neonates and 88 children) with a diagnosis of AIS were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time to AIS diagnosis was 87.9 hours for neonates, significantly longer than 24.8 hours for children (P = .0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine percent of the children with AIS demonstrated a likely cardioembolic cause, and 51 (58%) of the 88 children were inpatients at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inpatients were seen by a physician more quickly (P &lt; .01) and received a diagnosis of AIS sooner (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six (86%) of the 88 children had a focal neurologic deficit when first seen by a physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physicians documented a diagnosis/differential diagnosis for 44 (50%) of 88 children, and they documented a suspicion of AIS for only 23 (26%) of 88 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or focal signs was not associated with a quicker time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The considerable delays in the diagnosis of pediatric AIS are most likely related to the lack of awareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among medical staff members, despite risk factors and focal signs at presentation </plain></SENT>
