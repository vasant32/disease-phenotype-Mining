<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies indicate that embolic materials produce different ultrasound signals, depending on their acoustic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the possibility of characterizing emboli of different sources in the clinical setting, we compared the emboli signals of patients with cardiac embolic sources with those of patients with signals of carotid embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler monitoring (30 minutes per patient) of the middle cerebral arteries was performed in 80 patients with prosthetic cardiac valves and 20 patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The signal power of emboli was calculated in relation to the background Doppler signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients who were embolizing from prosthetic heart valves, the frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> signals was greater than in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> who were embolizing (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>: 58.2 +/- 11 versus 8.2 +/- 3 signals per hour; P &lt; .0001, two-sample t test), and total signal power and duration also were higher (power, 2231 +/- 63 versus 455 +/- 109 power units; duration, 55.9 +/- 0.8 versus 29.9 +/- 1.4 milliseconds; both P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of emboli signals were seen during cardiac systole, especially in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (89% in the first half of the cardiac cycle versus 72% in prosthetic valve patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients with prosthetic valves, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> signals were also recorded from the anterior cerebral artery; the signal count was not significantly different from the middle cerebral artery (43.2 +/- 12.5 versus 64.3 +/- 16 per hour), but anterior cerebral artery signals were of higher power (3306 +/- 148 versus 2441 +/- 109 power units, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is promise of being able to distinguish emboli on the basis of power measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Emboli of different sources (eg, carotid and cardiac) appear to have different ultrasonic characteristics, which are likely to be based on composition and size </plain></SENT>
