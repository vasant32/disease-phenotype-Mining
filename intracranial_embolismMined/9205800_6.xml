<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to elucidate the pathological changes in learning function and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> metabolism of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, following microsphere embolism in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microspheres (48 microns) were injected into the right internal carotid artery of the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Learning function was determined using a passive avoidance task on the seventh day after the embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the biochemical study, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> contents, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase activity were measured in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical acetylcholinesterase-containing fibers were quantitatively estimated in the embolized rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Passive avoidance was impaired in the microsphere-embolized rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microsphere embolism decreased the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> concentration and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase activity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the histochemical study, the length of cortical acetylcholinesterase-containing fibers was decreased, but cell density was unchanged in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the microsphere-embolized rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that microsphere embolism induces severe damage to cholinergic neurons, which may be related to the impairment of learning function in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
