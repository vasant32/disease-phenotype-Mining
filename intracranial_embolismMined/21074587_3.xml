<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study testes the hypothesis that neurons are not the unique source of neosynthesized BDNF after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and that non neuronal-BDNF producing cells differ according to the delay after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, cellular localization of BDNF and BDNF content of each hemisphere were analysed in parallel before and after (4h, 24h and 8d) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> of different severities was induced by embolization of the brain with variable number of calibrated microspheres allowing us to explore the association between BDNF production and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main results are that (a) unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increased BDNF production in both hemispheres with a more intense and long-lasting effect in the lesioned hemisphere, (b) BDNF levels either of the lesioned or unlesioned hemispheres were not inversely correlated to neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> severity whatever the delay after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, (c) in the unlesioned hemisphere, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> resulted in increased BDNF staining in neurons and ependymal cells (at 4h and 24h), (d) in the lesioned hemisphere, beside neurons and ependymal cells, microglial cells (at 24h), endothelial cells of cerebral arterioles (at 4h and 24h) and astrocytes (at 8d) exhibited a robust BDNF staining as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, overall data suggest that non neuronal cells are able to produce substantial amount of BDNF after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and that more attention should be given to these cells in the design of strategies aimed at improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery through BDNF-related mechanisms </plain></SENT>
