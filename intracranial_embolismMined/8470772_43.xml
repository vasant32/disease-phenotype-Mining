<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Demonstration of Trypanosoma cruzi in cardiac tissue by routine microscopy or culture is difficult in these patients, which has suggested that persistent organisms are not required for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, studies have focused on elucidating an autoimmune pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further assess the persistence of T. cruzi in host tissue, DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy specimens from seronegative or seropositive patients was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using T. cruzi-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trypanosoma cruzi DNA sequences were not consistently amplified from four seropositive patients who lacked evidence of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>) (0 positive of 12 heart samples, 0 positive of four gonadal samples, and 0 positive of four adrenal samples) or nine seronegative patients (0 positive of 27 heart samples, 0 positive of nine gonadal samples and 0 positive of nine adrenal samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In seven seropositive patients with severe <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>, cardiac tissue adjacent to inflammatory infiltrates yielded amplified T. cruzi DNA sequences in 18 of 21 heart samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parallel testing of gonadal and adrenal tissues from these same patients produced detectable T. cruzi DNA in none of the gonadal tissue samples and one of the seven adrenals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our studies demonstrate that T. cruzi, or a portion of its genome, is present in the inflammatory lesion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
