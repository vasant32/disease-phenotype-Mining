<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, the contribution of prothrombotic conditions to cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> has never been prospectively studied in a large series of pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, established a program in January 1992 to diagnose and treat children (term newborn to 18 years old) with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The routine evaluation for prothrombotic conditions included plasminogen, antithrombin, protein C, free protein S, activated protein C resistance, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibody, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed samples taken within 2 years of the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report results on patients seen from January 1, 1992, to January 1, 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-two patients (47 males and 45 females) entered the program during the study interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients ranged from newborn to 18 years in age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 78% of patients while sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred in 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were tested for prothrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One or more abnormal results were present in 35 (38%) of the 92 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority (21/35) had multiple abnormal test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The abnormal test results were anticardiolipin antibody (33%), plasminogen (9.5%), activated protein C resistance (9%), protein C (7%), antithrombin (12.5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (8%), and free protein S (11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Male sex predicted the presence of prothrombotic abnormalities (relative risk, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.5), but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type (relative risk, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-1.1), age group, and presence of other risk factors did not predict abnormal testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion (38%) of children with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> had evidence of prothrombotic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In particular, there was a predominance of children with anticardiolipin antibody (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data support a recommendation that children with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> be evaluated for prothrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
