<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disorders of the heart rhythm were found to play the leading part in the origin of cardiogenic embolisms of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been recorded that left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was prevalent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>heart rhythm disorders</z:hpo> whereas left ventricular was prevalent in lack of those disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, the one-third of cases did not show any heart thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The content of embolisms in cerebral arteries corresponded to the material of their source, whereas the site was specified by mechanical obstruction, with no changes in the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has been disclosed that in the majority of cases, stable embolism precipitates white infarction or white infarction with the hemorrhagic component whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> lysis is responsible for hemorrhagic infarction and (or) a transitory ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of hemorrhagic infarction differ from white infarction in less gravity and regression of the neurological symptomatology </plain></SENT>
