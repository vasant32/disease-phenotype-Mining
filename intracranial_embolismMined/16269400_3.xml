<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present aim was to study hemispheric side differences of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac-surgery patients with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> and with computer tomography (CT) performed (n = 77) were analyzed within a total group of 2641 consecutive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT data were reviewed for hemispheric and vascular distribution, and compared with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>-symptom data of immediate and delayed type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the included patients, 66% had positive CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of 'cardiac-type' operations (e.g., routine clamping and cannulation) and having immediate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, right-hemispheric lesions were more frequent than of the contra-lateral side (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> had strong dominance of bilateral findings, which was different from the unilateral pattern of 'cardiac-type' operations (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The middle-cerebral artery territory dominated, and when involved showed a significant (p = 0.022) right-sided distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both CT and clinical symptoms confirmed that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> after cardiac surgery has a right-hemispheric predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations may imply that aortic manipulation directs embolic material towards the brachiocephalic trunk </plain></SENT>
