<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The thrombotic occlusion of the rat middle cerebral artery was induced by a photochemical reaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and green light, which causes endothelial injury followed by platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and formation of a platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUN9216 (1 mg/kg) was injected intravenously 30 min after the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and the time for reopening of the middle cerebral artery by SUN9216 was monitored for a 60-min period under an operating microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the rats in which thrombolysis was achieved with SUN9216, the size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced as compared with that in the rats treated with saline and was comparable to the reduction produced by the combination doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, under the present experimental conditions, endothelin may not be involved in the impaired local cerebral blood flow after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
