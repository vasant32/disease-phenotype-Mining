<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>N-Phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (GVS-111) administered intravenously at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day, for the first time 1 h after ischaemic lesion and then for 9 post-operative days, with the last administration 15 min before testing, attenuated the deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This treatment significantly diminished the volume of the infarcted area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, post-ischaemic injection of GVS-111 demonstrated both cognition-restoring and neuroprotective properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cognition-restoring effect is probably based on an increase in neocortical and hippocampal neuronal plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effects of GVS-111 combine <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity with the ability to attenuate <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-provoked neurotoxicity and block voltage-gated ionic channels, i.e. the compound mitigates the main metabolic shifts involved in pathogenesis of brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
