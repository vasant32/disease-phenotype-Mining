<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed transesophageal echocardiography in 77 patients &gt; or = 70 years old (mean 76.9) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and investigated embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients were in sinus rhythm (SR) and 40 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (Af) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast was detected in 73% of Af and in 14% of SR (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was present in 10% of Af and none of SR (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>Patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, and aortic atherosclerotic plaque &gt; or = 4.0 mm in thickness in the proximal aortic arch were more commonly found in patients with SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, 1) Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> are more commonly detected in patients with Af, reflecting left atrial enlargement and blood stasis, and 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> and aortic atherosclerotic plaque &gt; or = 4.0 mm in thickness in the proximal aortic arch are important findings in patients with SR </plain></SENT>
