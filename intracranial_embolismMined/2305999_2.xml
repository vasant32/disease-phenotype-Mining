<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or recent occlusion of the graft itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients the proximal and in 3 the distal anastomosis were also narrowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vein graft was successfully dilated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients also received direct intragraft thrombolytic therapy during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five uncomplicated patients improved clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient was studied routinely as part of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>-streptokinase protocol and had no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This patient had a no-reflow phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient did not receive intragraft thrombolytic therapy and the procedure was complicated by embolization with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, a routine angiogram was performed two to six months after graft <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and in both the grafts were patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Another patient, initially successfully dilated, had recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> and restenosis of the proximal anastomosis ten months after angioplasty; this was successfully redilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty of acutely or recently totally occluded coronary vein grafts is feasible and improves <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> when present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional thrombolytic therapy prevents embolization </plain></SENT>
