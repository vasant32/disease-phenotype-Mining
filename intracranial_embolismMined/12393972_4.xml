<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Different models to study the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and to evaluate therapeutic strategies exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Described is the detailed procedure of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> model in the rat most closely resembling human embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and compare the model to other equivalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: An evaluation of a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> model was performed on 35 male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After preparation of the carotid artery, a catheter was introduced into the external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During injection of autologous, fibrin-rich emboli into the internal carotid artery the common carotid artery was temporarily occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and lesion size were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve fibrin-rich blood clots of 1.5 mm in length were necessary in order reliably to occlude the origin of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A stable decrease of rCBF and lesion size was confirmed by autoradiography, diffusion, and perfusion MRI, TTC-staining, biochemical imaging, and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this animal model, the situation of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is simulated closely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The model is suitable for investigations of the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and facilitates studies on the effects of thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
