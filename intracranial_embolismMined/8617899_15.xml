<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In a prospective study of 2101 older patients, electrocardiograms showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was present in 283 patients (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 42-month mean follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was associated with the incidence of new TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with and without prior TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A large long-term health care facility where 2101 older patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: The 2101 patients included 1451 women and 650 men, mean age 81 +/- 8 years (range 60 to 103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was present in 283 of 2101 patients (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 84 +/- 7 years in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and 81 +/- 8 years in patients with sinus rhythm (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was 5% in patients aged 60 to 70 years, 14% in patients aged 71 to 80 years, 13% in patients aged 81 to 90 years, and 22% in patients aged 91 to 103 years (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 31 +/- 18 months in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and 44 +/- 27 months in patients with sinus rhythm (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Previous TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 123 of 283 patients (43%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and in 431 of 1818 patients (24%) with sinus rhythm (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>New TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 131 of 283 patients (46%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and in 303 of 1818 patients (17%) with sinus rhythm (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The log-rank test showed that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> had a significantly higher probability of developing new TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than those with sinus rhythm (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The multivariate Cox regression model showed that independent risk factors for new TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were male sex (relative risk = 1.3), prior TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (relative risk = 3.1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (relative risk = 3.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, prior TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and male sex are independent risk factors for the development of new TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in older patients </plain></SENT>
