<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this Italian prospective registry was to evaluate the applicability and efficacy of the Mo.Ma Device (Invatec, Roncadelle, Italy) for the prevention of cerebral embolization during carotid artery stenting (CAS) in a real world population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 4 Italian centers, 416 patients (300 men; mean age 71.6+/-9 years) between October 2001 and March 2005 were enrolled in a prospective registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-hundred and sixty-four symptomatic (63.46%) with &gt;50% diameter stenosis and 152 (36.54%) asymptomatic patients with &gt;70% diameter stenosis were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Mo.Ma Proximal Flow Blockage Embolic Protection System was used to perform protected CAS, achieving cerebral protection by endovascular clamping of the common carotid artery (CCA) and of the external carotid artery (ECA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success, defined as the ability to establish protection with the Mo.Ma device and to deploy the stent, was achieved in 412 cases (99.03%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of flow blockage was 4.91+/-1.1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient intolerances to flow blockage were observed in 24 patients (5.76%), but in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the procedure was successfully completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No peri-procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications during hospitalization included 16 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (3.84%), 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (0.72%), 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0.48%) and 1 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0.24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a cumulative rate at discharge of 4.56% <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and of 0.72% major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent thirty-day follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At thirty-day follow-up, there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no minor and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, confirming the overall cumulative 4.56% incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> rate, and of 0.72% rate of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> at follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 245 cases (58.89%) there was macroscopic evidence of debris after filtration of the aspirated blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This Italian multicenter registry confirms and further supports the efficacy and applicability of the endovascular clamping concept with proximal flow blockage in a broad patient series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Results match favorably with current available studies on carotid stenting with cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
