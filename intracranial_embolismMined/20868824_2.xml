<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Managing anticoagulation after surgical ablation is challenging, especially when sinus rhythm has been restored and the left atrial appendage has been surgically managed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study purpose was to examine the applicability of the CHADS(2) in determining anticoagulation strategies after surgical ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CHADS(2) is a scoring system (0 to 6) used to indicate a patient's risk for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> and used for anticoagulation strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One point is given for any of the following conditions: C, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>; H, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; A, age 75 years old or greater; D, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>; and S, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> which receives 2 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A score of 2 or greater is an indication for a patient to be placed on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> unless otherwise contraindicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, longitudinally designed study where CHADS(2) was calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (n = 385) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical data on rhythm, anticoagulation medication, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) was obtained every 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used to determine significant predictors of either event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 385 patients, 17% presented with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a mean follow-up of 32.77 ± 16.33 months, embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> events occurred in 4 patients (4.2 first events per 1,000 patient years) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events occurred in 69 patients (72.8 first events per 1,000 patient years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in mean CHADS(2) between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> event and nonevent group (0.75 vs 1.46, respectively; p = 0.21), but there was a significant difference in CHADS(2) between the major bleed event group and the nonevent group (2.31 vs 1.41, respectively; p &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression model was not predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, but was significantly predictive of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events (χ(2) = 10.30, p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> after surgical ablation procedure is low and appears unrelated to the CHADS(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This, together with the higher rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, raises questions regarding the applicability of the CHADS(2) for patients after surgical ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A randomized study is required to define the risks and anticoagulation strategies for patients after surgical ablation </plain></SENT>
