<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vascular reactions were determined during the perivascular microapplication of artificial CSFs with increasing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (10(-11)-10(-3) M), H+ (pH 5.1-7.6), or K+ (0-10 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During nonischemic conditions the pial arterial reactivity to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and H+, but not to K+, was significantly increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> (250 mg/kg i.v.) when compared with the control reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> the reactivity to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> was abolished with and without the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> prior to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reactivity to K+ was partly preserved but not increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> when compared with previous results without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> improved the postischemic reactivity to perivascular H+ that had been found to be abolished in previous experiments without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The perivascular microapplication of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> showed no influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> on the vascular diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An important finding of the present study is the demonstration of an increase in cerebrovascular reactivity, which may give scope for therapeutic improvement of the regulation of CBF in pathophysiological conditions </plain></SENT>
