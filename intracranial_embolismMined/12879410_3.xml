<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Included were 409 outpatients with nonrheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (62 +/- 12 years, 36% female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> received oral anticoagulation; patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> received aspirin until the follow-up in 1995; afterwards, oral anticoagulation according to risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or embolism was recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were contacted during the year 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed in 73 patients (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (22%) diabetic and 169 (50%) nondiabetic patients had no other risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or embolism (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients were older, had more frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, left ventricular dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormalities</z:hpo>, left atrial or appendage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, larger left atria, and left atrial appendages than nondiabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 115 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients had a higher mortality than nondiabetic patients (7%/year versus 4%/year, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or embolism of diabetic (3%/year) and nondiabetic patients (2%/year) was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of oral anticoagulation was higher in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients (p = 0.0066) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> frequently have additional risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or embolism, and thus should be treated with oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whether in the rare cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is the only clinical risk factor, oral anticoagulation is indicated cannot be answered by the present study </plain></SENT>
