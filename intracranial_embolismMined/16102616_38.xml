<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Current clinical trials evaluating carotid stenting have focused on high-risk patients and may not reflect the broad population of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> who undergo treatment to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Carotid Revascularization Using Endarterectomy or Stenting Systems (CaRESS) phase I study is a multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized trial designed to address the question of whether carotid stenting (CAS) with cerebral protection is comparable to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with symptomatic (with &gt;50% stenosis) or asymptomatic (with &gt;75% stenosis) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were entered into the study in a 2:1 ratio of carotid stent and GuardWire Plus distal protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This unique trial model was developed through collaboration with the International Society of Endovascular Specialists, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Institutes of Health, and industry representatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end points included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 30 days and a composite 1-year end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) from 0 to 30 days and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from 31 days to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary end points included residual stenosis, restenosis, repeat angiography, and carotid revascularization at 30 days and 1 year and quality-of-life changes at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 397 patients (254 CEA and 143 CAS) were enrolled in the study: 32% were symptomatic and 68% were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in patient characteristics, symptoms, or surgical risk profiles between groups at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant differences in combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates at 30 days (3.6% CEA vs 2.1% CAS) or at 1 year (13.6% CEA vs 10.0% CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no significant difference in the combined end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or MI at 30 days (4.4% CEA vs 2.1% CAS) or at 1 year (14.3% CEA vs 10.9% CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between CEA and CAS in the secondary end points of residual stenosis (0% CEA vs 0.9% CAS), restenosis (3.6% CEA vs 6.3% CAS), repeat angiography (2.1% CEA vs 3.6% CAS), carotid revascularization (1.0% CEA vs 1.8% CAS), or change in quality of life (-1.56 points CEA vs -4.22 points CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CaRESS phase I study suggests that the 30-day and 1-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or MI with CAS is equivalent to that with CEA in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
