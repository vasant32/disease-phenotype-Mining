<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We sought to compare the effects on ophthalmic function of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and off-pump (OPCAB) grafting and to investigate whether <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular damage is associated with markers of cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> microvascular damage was assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography and color fundus photography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmic function was tested by the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity (VA), and cerebral injury, by transcranial Doppler ultrasound-detected emboli and S100 protein values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography and postoperative VA could not be obtained for 1 CABG-CPB patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> microvascular damage was detected in 5 of 9 CABG-CPB but in none of 10 OPCAB patients (risk difference, 55%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 23% to 88%; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Color fundus photography detected microvascular damage in 1 CABG-CPB patient but in no OPCAB patients; this lesion was associated with a field defect, which remained after 3 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in postoperative VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Doppler high-intensity transient signals (HITS) were 20.3 times more frequent in the CABG-CPB than in the OPCAB group (95% CI, 9.1 to 45; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Protein S100 levels were higher in the CABG-CPB than in the OPCAB group 1 hour after surgery (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HITS were 14.7 times more frequent (95% CI, 3.5 to 62; P=0.001) and S100 level 2.1 times higher (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.5; P=0.005) when <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular damage was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relative frequency of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular damage between groups shows the extent to which the risk of cerebral injury is reduced with OPCAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Imaging of part of the cerebral circulation provides evidence to validate markers of cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
