<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were gathered on disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, clinical course, laboratory results, history of risk factors, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted incidence rates for initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were 109 per 100,000 for whites and 208 per 100,000 for blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-specific rates were higher in blacks than whites, and highest for black females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of cases by type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was: atherothrombotic (6%), embolic (26%), lacunar (13%), infarction of unspecified origin (40%), parenchymatous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (6%), and unidentified type (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blacks had higher incidence rates for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, and black females had the highest incidence rate for lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence rates in this series were not significantly higher than those from prior population studies, suggesting that southern Alabama is not part of the so-called "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Belt" area of the southeastern United States </plain></SENT>
