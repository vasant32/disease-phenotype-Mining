<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rat carotid territory was embolized with arterial-like microthrombi formed under pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric cerebral blood flow before and after embolization was measured by the intraarterial <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-133 injection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen minutes after embolization, 24 rats were treated with 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg tissue plasminogen activator, and 27 were treated with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid angiography displayed the rate of occlusion of the cerebral arterial supply before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brains were fixed and evaluated neuropathologically and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral blood flow was reduced 70-86% after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The comparison of pretreatment and posttreatment angiography showed significant (p = 0.0005) reperfusion in the treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic therapy significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 55.1% to 24.4% of embolized hemisphere volume (p = 0.007) and increased the survival rate from 0.48 to 0.96 (p = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three percent of the embolized rats recanalized completely after thrombolytic treatment and developed almost no infarction (median volume 2.8%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No hemorrhagic complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early thrombolytic therapy induced recanalization and reduced mortality and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this model </plain></SENT>
