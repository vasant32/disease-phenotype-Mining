<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are very few reports on this subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a community-based case-control study, we tested the hypothesis that low levels of plasma GSH are closely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and its clinical types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The association between fasting plasma total GSH (tGSH) levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were assessed using conditional logistic regression analysis among 134 CVD cases and 435 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean tGSH concentrations were lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> cases than in the control subjects (3.06 versus 3.71 micromol/L; P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> types, both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> cases (2.98 versus 3.59 micromol/L; P=0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> cases (2.51 versus 3.43 micromol/L; P=0.0027) had significantly lower tGSH levels than the corresponding control groups had </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same tendency was observed for cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (3.45 versus 3.83 micromol/L; P=0.36) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (3.65 versus 3.77 micromol/L; P=0.69), but these differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for other confounding factors, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was significantly lower in the third (adjusted odds ratio, 041; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.77) and the fourth quartiles (adjusted odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.51) than in the first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association was most prominent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that reduced plasma tGSH levels are a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, especially for cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
