<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From March 1979 to December 1984, the Liotta low-profile porcine bioprosthesis was employed for mitral valve replacement in 71 patients to avoid potential left ventricle-prosthesis mismatch occasionally observed with the standard, high-profile, Hancock porcine xenograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of 61 operative survivors showed at 10 years an actuarial survival of 67% +/- 7%, freedom from thromboemboli of 96% +/- 2%, freedom from structural deterioration of 63% +/- 11% and freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Liotta bioprosthesis-related complications of 53% +/- 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complications related to excessive protrusion of the stent into the left ventricular cavity were eliminated with the Liotta bioprosthesis; the peculiar stent configuration, however, was responsible for an increased rate of structural deterioration requiring reoperation in 10 patients (2.8% +/- 0.9%/patient-year) at a mean interval of 76 +/- 18 months after mitral valve replacement (range, 45 to 106 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Common findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> explants were cusp <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1707539" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cusp tears</z:e>, and commissural rupture related to various degrees of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tissue calcification</z:e>, constantly leading to severe prosthetic incompetence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As also shown experimentally, such structural changes have been attributed to increased systolic stresses on the closed cusps, favored by excessive reduction of the stent height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our experience shows that the Liotta bioprosthesis used for mitral valve replacement does not provide any clear-cut advantage over standard porcine bioprostheses and that its long-term durability appears affected by the unique prosthetic design </plain></SENT>
