<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">Cholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> are commonly used as cognitive enhancers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in aged people, including those who may sustain ischemic attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Young adult (5 months) and aged (24 months) rats were treated with saline or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42944">galanthamine</z:chebi> at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg (i.p., once a day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drug treatment started 4 days before focal cortical photothrombosis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi>, 20 mg/kg) and continued for 21 days thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensorimotor recovery was assessed by a new beam-walking test and spatial learning by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water-maze</z:mp> over a 3-week follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi>-stained sections at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes in the cortex were similar in ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42944">galanthamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the beam-walking test, there was a transient impairment forelimb function and a permanent impairment in hindlimb after cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> both in young adult and aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="42944">Galanthamine</z:chebi> treatment did not affect the sensorimotor recovery rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of water-maze data did not reveal significant differences in length of path, escape latency, or swim speed between sham-operated, ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42944">galanthamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, present findings suggest that the aging brain has considerable plastic capacity to maintain functioning after focal cerebral insults restricted to the motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="42944">Galanthamine</z:chebi> is not beneficial with respect to the histological or functional outcome in rats subjected to cortical photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
