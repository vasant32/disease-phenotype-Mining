<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the hypothesis that there are emboli that are clinically unnoticeable but that may affect the intellectual function of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty-five patients were studied with a battery of psychometric tests before and after operation, two months postoperatively, and 2 to 8 years after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients sustained late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their late intellectual function was low, indicating an impairment in brain performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 155 patients had had no cerebral complications postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three had had valve replacement (Bj√∂rk-Shiley valves); 51, aortocoronary bypass operations; and 21, closure of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late intellectual function was significantly lower in the patients with a valve prosthesis than in the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this difference could be traced back to the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have not been able to confirm our hypothesis that late intellectual function in patients with a heart valve prosthesis deteriorates as a result of clinically silent emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, patients who have undergone aortocoronary bypass operation sustain more deterioration in late intellectual function than the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Late intellectual function in this study population clearly was influenced by events during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because cerebral injury can be shown almost regularly after open-heart operation, this investigation provides an incentive for further efforts to improve the quality of open-heart surgery with the aim of keeping brain function as intact as possible </plain></SENT>
