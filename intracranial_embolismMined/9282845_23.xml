<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To identify factors that predict survival and good neurologic outcome in patients undergoing basilar artery thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 42-month period, 20 of 22 consecutive patients with angiographic proof of basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were treated with local intraarterial urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain CT scans, neurologic examinations, symptom duration, clot location, and degree of recanalization were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall survival was 35% at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival in patients with only distal basilar clot was 71%, while survival in patients with proximal or midbasilar clot was only 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 29% of patients with distal basilar clot and 15% of patients with proximal or midbasilar clot had good neurologic outcomes (modified Rankin score of 0 to 2 and Barthel index of 95 to 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization was achieved in 50% of patients; 60% of those survived and 30% had good neurologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of patients with less than complete recanalization, only 10% survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither duration of symptoms before treatment (range, 1 to 79 hours), age (range, 12 to 83 years), nor neurologic status at the initiation of treatment (Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score range, 3 to 15) predicted outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment CT findings (positive or negative for related ischemic changes) did not predict outcome or hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The single best predictor of survival after basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and intraarterial thrombolysis was distal clot location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization favored survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Radiologically evident related infarctions, advanced age, delayed diagnosis, and poor pretreatment neurologic status did not predict poor outcome and therefore should not be considered absolute contraindications for intraarterial thrombolysis in patients with basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
