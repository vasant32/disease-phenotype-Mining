<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the prognosis of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and dense spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) and to determine the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> under continued oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with AF and dense SEC have an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is little knowledge about the long-term fate and the rate of clinical silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> under continued oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1998 and 2001, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients with AF and dense SEC were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed serial and prospective transesophageal echocardiography, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical examinations during a period of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 128 patients with dense SEC and AF were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 143 patients with faint SEC and AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, three patients (2%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of eight patients (6%) died due to embolic events, and 19 (15%) patients had silent embolism, as documented on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with an event had significantly lower left atrial appendage peak emptying velocities and more commonly had a history of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and denser SEC, as compared with patients without an event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AF and dense SEC have a high likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (22%) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, despite oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low peak emptying velocities of the left atrial appendage and dense SEC are independent predictors of an event </plain></SENT>
