<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Among the naturally occurring compounds, turmeric from the dried rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa has long been used extensively as a condiment and a household remedy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over Southeast Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Turmeric contains essential oil, yellow pigments (curcuminoids), <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> and oleoresin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed for investigating the neuroprotective efficacy and the time window for effective therapeutic use of Curcuma oil (C. oil) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In the present study, the effect of post ischemic treatment of C.oil after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in the rat was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C.oil (500 mg/kg body wt) was given 4 hrs post <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significant effect on lesion size as visualized by using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and neuroscore was still evident when treatment was started 4 hours after insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were assessed for behavioral deficit scores after 5 and 24 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the rats were sacrificed for evaluation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volumes and other parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: C.oil ameliorated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced neurological functional deficits and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volumes measured after 5 and 24 hrs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 24 hrs, immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of iNOS, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and Bax/Bcl-2 were altered after the insult, and antagonized by treatment with C.oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>C.oil significantly reduced nitrosative stress, tended to correct the decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, and also affected caspase-3 activation finally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrated that iNOS-derived NO produced during ischemic injury was crucial for the up-regulation of ischemic injury targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>C.oil down-regulates these targets this coincided with an increased survival rate of neurons </plain></SENT>
