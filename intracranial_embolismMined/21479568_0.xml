<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The most serious complications of carotid artery stenting (CAS) are related to the release of particles into the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although embolic protection devices may reduce the incidence of cerebral embolization, their use may be associated with additional complications including spasm or dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we present our experience with patients who underwent unprotected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> from October 2008 to June 2010.Stenosis diagnosed based on carotid duplex and/or CT angiography findings and confirmed by digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stenting procedures were done without using a protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologist evaluated neurological situation of the patients, 24 h, 30 days, 3 and 6 months after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had carotid duplex scan scheduled on the third and sixth month after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 116patients underwent stenting; technical success rate was 100% .Mean age of patients was 68.48 ± 9.84 years, and 69% of the patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient (1/116, 0.86%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One non-neurologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1/116, 0.86%) occurred 18 h after the procedure because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 1-month follow-up, only one patient (1/115, 0.87%) presented with neurological complication as a consequence of thalamic hemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six months follow-up revealed two cases (2/115, 1.74%) with in-stent restenosis which one of them was severe and symptomatic and underwent angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Unprotected carotid stenting appears to accompany with low early and late complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cerebral embolization during CAS is not the only cause of these complications and the use of cerebral protection devices may therefore not prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major complications including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, hyperperfusion syndrome, and re-stenosis </plain></SENT>
