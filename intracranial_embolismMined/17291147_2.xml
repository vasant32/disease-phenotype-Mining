<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To present a technique for internal carotid artery stenting (CAS) with dual cerebral protection in patients with high-grade stenosis caused by large, soft atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: The MO.MA proximal cerebral protection device is first placed in the external and common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete blockade of blood flow is achieved by inflating the occlusion balloons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Spider filter is delivered to the distal internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedural steps of CAS are performed during continuous and simultaneous proximal occlusion and distal filter protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After postdilation of the stent, the occlusion balloons are deflated, and antegrade flow is re-established with the distal filter basket still open </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In selected patients with large atherosclerotic plaques, a dual cerebral protection technique during CAS may be a more efficacious form of cerebral protection than a single protection device </plain></SENT>
