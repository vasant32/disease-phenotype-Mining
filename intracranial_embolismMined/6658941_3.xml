<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe 3 cases of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> associated with cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The autopsy findings suggested that in 2 cases, the embolic fat globules entered the systemic circulation directly as a result of protrusion of epicardial fat into the left atrial chamber along the suture line in one case, and through an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The characteristic latent interval between surgical trauma and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurologic manifestations was lacking in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evolution of neurologic manifestations and the pathologic findings in the third case were similar to those usually seen in posttraumatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the pathogenetic mechanisms of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> following cardiac surgery may vary in different cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, it emphasizes the importance of autopsy in the investigation of this serious but preventable complication </plain></SENT>
