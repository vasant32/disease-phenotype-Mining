<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Platelet function exhibits circadian variation with highest levels of activity in the morning and plays a central role in arterial thrombotic events, including thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to the platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> occluding the carotid artery, multiple embolic signals are detected in the middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that patients undergoing CEA early in the day may be at an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk and this would manifest as an increased postoperative embolic count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected prospectively on 235 patients undergoing primary CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accurate start and finish times were recorded in addition to the number of postoperative emboli detected in the first three hours after CEA using transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For operations finishing before midday, there was a 3.6-fold increase in the number of emboli detected relative to afternoon finishes (53.2 vs 14.8, P = .002) with similar results for starts before 10:30 AM (48.1 vs 14.7, P =.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant correlation between start time and emboli count (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 55 patients with no postoperative emboli, only 19 had a morning start (relative risk 0.63, P = .011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were 6.9 times more likely to require treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran-40</z:chebi> to prevent progression onto a thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> if their CEA finished before midday (P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a significantly increased rate of postoperative embolization for operations begun earlier in the day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomies performed in the afternoon may be at less risk of developing postoperative thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
