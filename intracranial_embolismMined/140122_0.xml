<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The symptomatology is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to effective collateral circulation the patients survived and recovered from severe neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the patients, clincally in a state resembling akinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002300'>mutism</z:hpo> for several weeks, not only survived but regained speech </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this has not been reported in the literature previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our cases as well as similar ones of others showed, that for development of effective intrcranial collaterals the time, during which occlusion occurs, is clearly of importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Development of collateral circulation also depends on the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the circle of Willis and a sufficient extracranial circulation </plain></SENT>
