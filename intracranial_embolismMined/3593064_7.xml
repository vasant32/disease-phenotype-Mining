<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was the most common presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> demonstrated by cardiac catheterization or surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a newly discovered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo>, and one had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> that had previously been treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of the cardiac physical examination, chest roentgenography, and electrocardiography were unremarkable in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> demonstrated by contrast echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of these patients underwent cardiac catheterization; seven had abnormal catheterization study results: four had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> and three had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe that contrast echocardiography can provide important diagnostic information, even in situations in which cardiac involvement is not suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed before the optimal treatment of presumptive paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> can be determined </plain></SENT>
