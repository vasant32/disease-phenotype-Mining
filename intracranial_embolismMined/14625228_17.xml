<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1999, 38 asymptomatic BA bifurcation and BA-SCA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with GDCs at the National Cardiovascular Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DW studies were performed for 26 patients between 2 and 5 days after GDC embolizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> DW images were reviewed by two radiologists for depiction of abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were retrospectively evaluated with clinical and technical factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DW images showed new hyperintense lesions in 18 patients (69%), with seven (27%) incurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deteriorations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> symptomatic patients fully recovered by discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (78%) of 18 patients showed new lesions proximal to the treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>; that is, in the cerebellar hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three cases treated with the balloon-assisted technique, new hyperintense lesions were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our experience, most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> related to the use of the GDC embolization may be caused by catheter manipulation, especially in the case of the balloon-assisted technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Caution should be exercised in the handling of catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a softer and smaller caliber catheter and simple GDC technique should be considered </plain></SENT>
