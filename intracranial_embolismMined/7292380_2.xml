<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A bicuspid mitral bioprosthesis was prepared by mounting glutaraldehyde-processed porcine pericardium onto commercially available Brownlee-Yates stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bioprostheses were inserted into 17 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic performance and long-term function of the valve was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 animals in the survival group, eight died within the 24-72 hour postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture of these animals revealed progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023212" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular failure</z:e> although the bioprostheses were tested and found competent both at insertion and at necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The causes of the late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were deterioration of the porcine pericardium in two, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> haemodynamic studies showed a significantly high closing reflux from within the tubular bioprosthesis, and this reflux was found to be inherent in the design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that any stented bicuspid valve where the stent assumes the function of the papillary muscles, has to be tailored so that parts of the tissue can assume the function of the chordae tendineae to minimise the closing reflux </plain></SENT>
