<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of cases of Loa-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> have been reported following ivermectin (Mectizan) treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029001" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">onchocerciasis</z:e> in patients with high Loa microfilaraemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation for these severe reactions is the formation of micro-emboli in <z:mp ids='MP_0000774'>small brain</z:mp> vessels as a result of massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> of Loa microfilariae in the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> might be prevented by giving an initial low dose of ivermectin to induce a more gradual action on the Loa microfilariae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, a trial was conducted on 23 adult patients in Cameroon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One group received the recommended dose of 150 micrograms/Kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other group received a lower dose of 50 micrograms/Kg (one 3 mg tablet of Mectizan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood smears were made daily from day 1 to 7 after treatment and then on days 15 and 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results showed no difference in the effect of the dosage level on Loa microfilaraemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that an initial low dose of 3 mg Mectizan will not prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> following treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029001" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">onchocerciasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
