<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurological injury after cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> may be due to thromboinflammatory responses at sites of air-injured endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> inhibits multiple thromboinflammatory processes, we hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> would decrease neurological impairment after cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To first establish a dose of air that would cause unequivocal neurological injury, anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits received either 0, 50, 100, or 150 microL/kg of air into the internal carotid artery (n = 5 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hour later, anesthesia was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were neurologically evaluated at 24 hours with the use of a scale ranging from 0 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) to 97 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>) points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a subsequent experiment, anesthetized rabbits received either <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (n = 17) or saline (n = 15) 5 minutes before air injection (150 microL/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was given as a 200-IU/kg bolus and followed by a constant infusion of 75 IU.kg-1.h-1 for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Equal volumes of saline were given to control rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two hours later, anesthesia was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals were neurologically evaluated 24 hours after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a monotonic relationship between dose of air and severity of neurological impairment at 24 hours (P = 1.1 x 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving 150 microL/kg of air were unequivocally injured (score, 60 +/- 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> animals had significantly less neurological impairment at 24 hours (34 +/- 14) than saline controls (52 +/- 8) (P = .0013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When given prophylactically, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> decreases neurological impairment caused by severe cerebral arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
