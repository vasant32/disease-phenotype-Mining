<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FMD affects the proximal one-third of the internal carotid artery in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and is bilateral in 60% to 85%, with middle-aged women affected in 85% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been postulated to result from severe stenosis or thrombotic occlusion at the FMD site </plain></SENT>
