<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two thousand and twenty-nine coronary artery bypass graft operations were performed in our institution between October 15, 1985, and December 27, 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, there were 30 documented neurologic events suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic injury during the intraoperative or the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, monoparesis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, bilateral cortical dysfunction, cortical and brainstem dysfunction, and left homonymous hemianopsia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> directly attributable to neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients had a CT scan of the head, of which 15 showed evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction, two suggested watershed lesions from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, and the remainder showed findings consistent with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> or primary intracranial occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five carotid arteriograms and one digital subtraction arteriogram of the carotids were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic findings revealed two common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>, one callosal marginal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and two cases of bilateral high-grade internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the contention that in patients who suffer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> associated with coronary artery bypass grafting, the main mechanism of injury is cerebral embolization rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
