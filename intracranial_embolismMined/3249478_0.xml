<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural observations revealed that initial changes occurred in the vascular feet of astroglial cells and the subsequent swelling of postsynapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Succeedingly presynapses and nerve cells also became atrophic but this was considered to be caused by astrocytic degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these findings, it is speculated that the neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was secondary to the changes in the neuropil around the capillary caused by disturbance of the nutritional supply from the blood induced by microcirculatory disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The above described findings seemed to have some similarity to those of nonspecific degeneration of the cortex observed in the brain, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
