<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, using laser Doppler flowmetry we investigated the cerebral blood flow velocity changes in response to changes in arterial pressure, before and after embolization in a canine bypass model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval, 8 anesthetized dogs had a laser Doppler flow probe positioned over the temporoparietal dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During 37 degrees C cardiopulmonary bypass, the cerebral blood flow velocity response to changing mean arterial pressure (40 to 85 mm Hg in random order) was assessed before and after systemic embolization of 100 mg of 97-microm latex microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before embolization, cerebral blood flow velocity increased 39% as mean arterial pressure increased from 40 to 85 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following embolization, a 94% increase in cerebral blood flow velocity was demonstrated over the same mean arterial pressure range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The slopes of the curves relating cerebral blood flow velocity to mean arterial pressure were 0.21+/-0.74 and 1.31+/-0.87, before and after embolization (p = 0.016) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regional cerebral blood flow autoregulation may be impaired by microembolization known to occur during cardiopulmonary bypass, increasing the dependence of cerebral blood flow on mean arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
