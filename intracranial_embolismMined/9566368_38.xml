<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At 46 hospitals in Baltimore City, 5 central Maryland counties, and Washington, DC, the chart of every patient 15 to 44 years of age with a primary or secondary diagnosis of possible cerebral arterial infarction during 1988 and 1991 was abstracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Probable and possible etiologies were assigned following written guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 428 first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 212 (49.5%) were assigned at least one probable cause, 80 (18.7%) had no probable cause but at least one possible cause, and 136 (31.8%) had no identified probable or possible cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 212 with at least one probable cause, the distribution of etiologies was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> (31.1%), hematologic and other (19.8%), small vessel (lacunar) disease (19.8%), nonatherosclerotic vasculopathy (11.3%), illicit drug use (9.4%), oral contraceptive use (5.2%), large artery atherosclerotic disease (3.8%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (1.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were an additional 69 recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this hospital-based registry within a region characterized by racial/ethnic diversity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e>, hematologic and other causes, and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were the most common etiologies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nearly a third of both first and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had no identified cause </plain></SENT>
