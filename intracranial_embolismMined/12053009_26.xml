<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been proposed that the novel spin trap agent disodium-[(tert-butylimino)<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-1,3-disulfonate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35580">N-oxide</z:chebi> (NXY-059) may be useful in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, there is little information concerning the safety of NXY-059 when administered in combination with the only Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacological agent for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we determined the effects of NXY-059G, a generic form of NXY-059, on <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate and volume when administered alone or in combination with tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we determined whether NXY-059G affected 2 physiological variables, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and body temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male New Zealand White rabbits were embolized by injecting a large blood clot into the middle cerebral artery via a catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five minutes after embolization, NXY-059G (100 mg/kg) was infused intravenously; control rabbits received infusions of saline, the vehicle required to solubilize NXY-059G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In tPA studies, the thrombolytic was administered intravenously starting 60 minutes after embolization (20% bolus injection/80% infusion over 30 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body temperature and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were measured throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postmortem analysis included assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate, size, and location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the vehicle control group, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> was 52% (n=23), and this was increased by 67% if tPA was administered (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rabbits treated with NXY-059G in the absence of tPA had a 79% incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (n=19), an increase of 52% over the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the combination drug-treated groups, the NXY-059G/tPA group had a 47% incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a decrease of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volume in the NXY-059G+tPA group compared with the other 3 groups included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant effect of NXY-059G either alone or in combination with tPA on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate or volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>NXY-059G did not significantly alter the physiological variables that were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that NXY-059G may affect the integrity of the cerebral vasculature when administered immediately after an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as evidenced by an increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, when NXY-059G is administered in combination with tPA, it may improve the safety of tPA by reducing the incidence of tPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mechanism(s) involved in the NXY-059G-induced increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate and reduction of tPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
