<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Dislodgement of aortic arch atheroma caused by a perfusion "jet" from the aortic cannula may be a major cause of atheroemboli during coronary artery surgery when using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two very different cannulas, the Soft-Flow aortic cannula and the Dispersion cannula, which have been designed to reduce exit velocity (cm/s) during perfusion, are compared with a standard steel tip cannula and to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To demonstrate any significant differences transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used to measure exit velocity of each cannula at a distance of 1, 2, and 3 cm from the tip and compare flow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> within the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients in whom the cannula tip could be identified and colored Doppler imaging could demonstrate representative <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were randomly assigned into one of three groups of 3 patients each: group I, a standard steel-tip end-hole cannula (7.3 mm); group II, the Soft-Flow cannula (8.0 mm); and group III, the Dispersion cannula (8.0 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The standard steel tip cannula demonstrated a long narrow perfusion jet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Soft-Flow cannula <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was made up of multiple smaller exiting jets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Dispersion cannula demonstrated a broad wedge-shaped perfusion pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perfusion hemodynamics (cardiopulmonary bypass hematocrit in d/L, cardiopulmonary bypass blood flow in L/m, mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass mm Hg, and perfusion line pressure in mm Hg) were not significantly different between each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean velocities between group I (318 +/- 63 cm/s at 1 cm, 296 +/- 60 cm/s at 2 cm, 271 +/- 85 cm/s at 3 cm) and group II (351 +/- 31 cm/s at 1 cm, 240 +/- 103 cm/s at 2 cm, 171 +/- 120 cm/s at 3 cm) were not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group III (the Dispersion cannula) demonstrated significantly reduced velocities (174 +/- 22 cm/s at 1 cm, 138 +/- 23 cm/s at 2 cm, 90 +/- 36 cm/s at 3 cm) when compared with the other two groups (p &lt; 0.05, analysis of variance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Dispersion cannula is significantly different with a lower perfusion velocity and the elimination of the exiting jet or jets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This cannula warrants further clinical study as it may reduce atheroemboli during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
