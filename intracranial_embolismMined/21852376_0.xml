<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Angioplasty and stenting of the IA have been reported with high technical and clinical success rates, low complication rates and good mid-term patency rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different antegrade or retrograde endovascular catheter-based approaches and combinations with surgical exposure of the CCA are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine safety, efficacy and mid-term clinical and radiological outcome of the stent-assisted treatment of atherosclerotic stenotic disease of the IA with special focus on the different technical approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2008, 18 patients (12 men, 6 women) with symptomatic high-grade stenosis (&gt;80%) of the IA were treated with endovascular stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 60.4 years (range, 48-78 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean angiographic and clinical follow-up was 2.7 years (range, 0.3-9.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was performed by using the mRS at hospital discharge, routine follow-up controls, and a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients, a percutaneous approach was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients, the lesions were accessed retrogradely through a cervical cut-down with common carotid arteriotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, a simultaneous ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, primary stent placement was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 2 procedure-related transient complications (11.1%) due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> without permanent morbidity or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients showed improvement of the preprocedural symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the latest clinical follow-up (mean, 2.7 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients showed an excellent or good outcome (mRS, 0 or 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients (11.1%), a secondary stent placement was needed due to a significant symptomatic in-stent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous and open retrograde stenting of high-grade stenosis of the IA is a viable less invasive alternatives to open bypass surgery with good midterm clinical results and patency rates </plain></SENT>
