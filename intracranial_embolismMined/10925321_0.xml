<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> is an infrequent but serious complication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>), and the role of primary preventive antithrombotic or anticoagulation therapy is undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-intensity transient signals (HITS) by Doppler ultrasound representing microemboli have been described in various clinical settings associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the feasibility, reproducibility, and prevalence of HITS in patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (&lt; or = 35%, mean 25%) and New York Heart Association class II to III who were not receiving antithrombotic or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and 20 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were prospectively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, significant cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, a history of cerebrovascular disease, and those who otherwise required antithrombotic or anticoagulation therapy were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-hour pulsed-wave Doppler recordings over the common carotid artery (CCA) were performed on 3 separate days in each subject by a single, experienced, blinded sonographer with a 4-MHz probe (TC-2000, Nicolet/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e>) with a specially designed probe holder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies were read in a blinded, random fashion by 2 independent, experienced HITS Doppler recording readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HITS in the CCA were detected in 6 (20%) of 30 patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and in 3 (15%) of 20 volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intrareader and interreader reproducibility were high (kappa = 0.91 and 0.84, respectively; P &lt;.001), whereas intrasubject reproducibility over the 3 visits was moderate to low (kappa = 0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between HITS characteristics, that is, intensity and duration, in patients versus controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CCA HITS in patients with clinically stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> who are not receiving anticoagulation/antithrombotic therapy and are not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is low and not significantly different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that HITS monitoring is not a viable surrogate marker for increased thromboembolic risk in such patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
