<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary bypass, in particular, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, has been implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared neurocognitive function and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in patients undergoing on-pump and off-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 212 patients admitted for CABG were randomly assigned to on-pump (n = 104) or off-pump (n = 108) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Embolic signals were detected with bilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitive tests were administered preoperatively, on discharge from hospital, at 6 weeks, and at 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Composite neurocognitive scores were derived using principal component analysis and were compared between the two groups, using analysis of covariance to adjust for baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At discharge from hospital, the adjusted composite neurocognitive score was 0.25 standard deviations greater in the off-pump group compared with the on-pump group (95% confidence interval: 0.05 to 0.45; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference at 6 weeks (0.09 standard deviations, 95% confidence interval: -0.11 to +0.30; p = 0.4) and 6 months (-0.002 standard deviations, 95% confidence interval: -0.23 to +0.23; p = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median number of embolic signals was 1,605 (751 to 2,473) during on-pump and 9 (4 to 27) in off-pump CABG (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age, length of education, and on-pump status were independent predictors of the predischarge neurocognitive score (p = 0.02, 0.03, and 0.006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral emboli</z:e> are more prevalent during on-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At discharge from hospital, neurocognitive function is better after off-pump surgery, possibly as a result of the lower embolic load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the difference in neurocognitive function does not persist at 6 weeks and 6 months </plain></SENT>
