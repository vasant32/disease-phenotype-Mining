<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study is longitudinal and compares the development of body communication and speech (here: the use of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and pronouns) during the 18-month period of rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a clear development, showing an increased use of nouns, verbs, and adjectives and a decreased use of body communication to convey factual information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is taken to show that compensatory body communication for factual information can be used by Wernicke's aphasics, something that is easily obscured by the finding often reported that most aphasics tend to show body communication patterns that are in accordance with their speech patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of pronouns and gestures for turnkeeping at an intermediate stage, when the patient is shifting from gestures to words for factual content, is also discussed </plain></SENT>
