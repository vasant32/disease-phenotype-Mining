<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple techniques have been developed to maximize the effectiveness and safety of excluding these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> from the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endovascular balloons have been used for proximal control of parent arteries during the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report the authors describe the technique of navigating an endovascular balloon across the neck of paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in four patients to gain proximal control, improve the accuracy of clip placement, and reduce the risk of distal embolization of intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six consecutive patients with giant or complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ophthalmic or paraclinoid internal carotid artery that were not amenable to endovascular obliteration were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was exposed and dissected for microsurgical clipping, and attempts were made to navigate a nondetachable, compliant <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> balloon across the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If successfully placed, the balloon was inflated during clip placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four patients, the balloon was successfully navigated across the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and was inflated during clip application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid artery tortuosity precluded navigation of the balloon into the intracranial circulation in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were completely excluded from the parent vessel according to postoperative angiography studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No complication occurred as a direct result of the endovascular portion of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endovascular balloon stenting of complex paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> during microvascular clipping may provide an adjunctive therapy that facilitates safe and accurate clip placement </plain></SENT>
