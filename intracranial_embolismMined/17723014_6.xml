<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, patient age, and gender on major periprocedural (30-day) complications (major and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) following carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An exploratory analysis was performed of 695 patients (516 men; mean age 69.9+/-8.4 years) enrolled consecutively between September 1999 and September 2002 in a multicenter Italian/German registry of routine CAS using cerebral protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 535 nondiabetic patients and 160 diabetic patients in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis revealed that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and age, but not gender, impacted the cumulative 30-day incidence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.8, p = 0.068 and OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.12, p = 0.031, respectively), as well as the 30-day incidence of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 21.8, p = 0.007 and OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25, p = 0.018, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to receiver-operating characteristic analysis, age had no discriminatory power to predict complications in nondiabetic patients, but an age of 75 years was identified as the optimal cut point to predict complications in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with nondiabetic patients, diabetics &gt; or =75 years had a 4.3 greater risk of experiencing any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (95% CI 1.3 to 12.3, p = 0.016) and a 12.0 greater risk of a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (95% CI 2.1 to 66.5, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetics &lt;75 years had no increase in risk over that of nondiabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diabetic patients &gt; or =75 years carry a significantly increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after protected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings should be taken into consideration when treating elderly diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
