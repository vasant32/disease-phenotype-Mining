<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rheology and flow, the coagulation mechanism, the fibrinolytic enzyme system, and the properties of platelets to adhere and aggregate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> play a significant role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of paramount importance to neurosurgeons is the role of the vascular wall in thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque demonstrates this point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in this setting include stenosis and reduced flow, turbulence, and the elements in the lesion with which blood interacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These are principally collagen, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, fatty acids, and the thromboplastic activity of vascular subendothelial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Current concepts of the etiologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Along with other predisposing factors, platelets may play a significant role in the initiation of the process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The current status of clinical trials with inhibitors of platelet function in the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vascular reconstructive surgery, the principles which underlie good technique are those which best insure against <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The briefest possible period of stasis during surgery should be maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reconstruction should result in a smooth blood flow pattern with rapid runoff and minimal stenosis or gaps between apposed endothelial surfaces </plain></SENT>
