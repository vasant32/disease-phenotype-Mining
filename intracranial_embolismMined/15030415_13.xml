<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the perfusion rate of the transseptal sheath on the incidence of thromboembolic complications during catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) or LA macroreentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed clinical and procedural data from 86 consecutive patients (153 procedures) referred for catheter ablation of AF (74 patients) or LA macroreentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (12 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transseptal sheath was continuously perfused at a low flow rate (3 mL/hour) for the first 32 patients and at a high flow rate (180 mL/hour) for the subsequent 54 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ablation was mainly performed using map-guided isolation of pulmonary veins for AF and three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping for LA macroreentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients (6% of patients and 3.5% of procedures) developed a cerebral thromboembolic complication, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> during procedures using low-flow perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sheath perfusion rate and total procedure duration were the two variables significantly associated with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P = 0.013 and 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment in a multivariable analysis, sheath perfusion rate remained the only risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk was 17 times higher using low-flow than high-flow perfusion (odds ratio 17.26, 95% confidence interval 1.14-260.81, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No other clinical or procedural parameters had any significant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sheath perfusion rate is an important determinant of the risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during complex LA ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Continuous high-flow perfusion appears to be effective in preventing this complication </plain></SENT>
