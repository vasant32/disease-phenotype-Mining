<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported the pathological findings of an autopsy case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo>, with special reference to the topography of vascular lesion in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amorphous eosinophilic, <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, endothelial proliferation and aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of affected vessels were prominent features in the visceral organs such as the heart, kidneys, liver, pancreas, adrenals, thyroid and alimentary tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these vascular lesions were restricted to the arteriolar-capillary junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the lungs as reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were rarely seen in so-called portal vessels existed in the liver, pancreas and anterior pituitary gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, there were many vascular lesions similar to those of visceral organs in the cerebral gray matter, brain stem and cerebellar cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A few lesions were also seen in the white matter, subarachnoid space and choroid plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many foci of chromatolytic neurons as well as a few petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and minute <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were observed in the parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The characteristic of the vascular lesions in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex was the sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were predominantly located at the bifurcation of arterioles, 20-50 microns in diameter, and were numerous in the third or fourth cortical layer of the cerebrum, and in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> is still unknown, the characteristic topography of vascular lesions suggests primary endothelial involvement in this disease </plain></SENT>
