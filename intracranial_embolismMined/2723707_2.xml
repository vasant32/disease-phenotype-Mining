<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient in whom EEG changes indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> occurred at the time of carotid clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes resolved promptly after placement of a carotid shunt but recurred 11 minutes later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the EEG changes, the carotid shunt was evaluated and found to have become occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EEG monitoring was crucial to the detection of shunt occlusion in the absence of other systemic changes or surgical difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rapidity and magnitude of the changes in the EEG suggest that, if the occlusion had not been discovered and the patency of the shunt restored, the patient would have been at increased risk for neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
