<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Many medical procedures undergo rapid evolution and process of care improvements after introduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>National outcome standards are useful to help physicians, institutions, and other stakeholders evaluate the quality of their programs and take action when suboptimal outcomes are identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this analysis was to derive contemporary risk-adjusted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates from a large, contemporary, independently assessed outcome database within 30 days after carotid artery stenting (CAS) in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The second phase of carotid ACCULINK/ACCUNET post approval trial to uncover rare events (CAPTURE 2) is an ongoing prospective, multicenter, clinical trial conducted to assess CAS outcomes in the general practice setting after device approval for high surgical risk patients (symptomatic with &gt;50% stenosis or asymptomatic with &gt;80% stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A neurologist examined the patients before the procedure, at 1 day and 30 days after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) within the periprocedural period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> and neurologic events suspected to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were adjudicated by an independent clinical events adjudication committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis including stepwise logistic and multivariable modeling was performed to determine clinical predictors of periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome and generate a parsimonious model that could be used for a clinical standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five thousand two hundred ninety-seven consecutive patients (5297) had CAS performed by 459 physicians at 186 sites before the data cutoff of January 10, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 30-day rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 2.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariable predictors of periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> included age, symptomatic status, and dwell time of embolic protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A parsimonious model P(i) = 1/(1+e (-(-3.83 + 0.51 x (symptomatic) + 0.31 x (age &gt;or=80) + 0.62 x (age &gt;or=80 x symptomatic))), including symptomatic and octogenarian status and the term of the interaction of the two, was established based on consideration of clinical predictors, clinical interaction, and practicability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CAS outcomes in patients at high surgical risk have comparable periprocedural outcomes to published randomized trials of endarterectomy for patients at standard surgical risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A model is presented for calculating a contemporary national standard for risk-adjusted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Quality improvement measures could be based on relative performance to this benchmark and could improve overall outcomes for patients undergoing CAS </plain></SENT>
