<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In published multicenter registries, the use of PEO for carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been demonstrated to be safe and efficient in patient populations selected for anatomical and/or clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 2004 to May 2009, 1,300 patients underwent CAS using PEO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received an independent neurological assessment before the procedure and 1 h, 24 h, and 30 days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedural success was achieved in 99.7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In hospital, major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events included 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0.38%), 6 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (0.46%), 5 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (0.38%), and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 30 days of follow-up, 2 additional patients died (0.15%), and 1 patient had a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0.07%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> incidence was 1.38% (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients presented a higher 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> incidence when compared with asymptomatic patients (3.04% vs. 0.82%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was observed between patients at high (1.88%; n = 12) and average surgical risk (1.07; n = 7) (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Operator experience, symptomatic status, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were found to be independent predictors of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of PEO for CAS is safe and effective in an unselected patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anatomical and/or clinical conditions of high surgical risk were not associated with an increased rate of adverse events </plain></SENT>
