<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When air bubbles get into the electric field between electrodes, specific changes of impedance depending on the bubbles size could be recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A lot of small bubbles sharply increased the impedance according to their total volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ih the air compression up to 10 kgs/cm2 and in following decompression, the intracranial impedance and pressure smoothly changed according to barogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 15 min of stying under pressure the dogs developed during decompression a sharp increase of the intracranial impedance and pressure which, similarly to the results of the model experiments, should be regarded as the consequence of formation of a free gas phase in the system of intracranial circulation </plain></SENT>
