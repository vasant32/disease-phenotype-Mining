<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In seven of these patients, sudden loss of hearing in one ear developed immediately after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of the seven patients showed improvement in hearing after the initial loss, although in no case did the hearing return completely to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> but two were listless postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the operations were for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>; the remainder were coronary artery bypass procedures </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and decreased consciousness after operations is also discussed </plain></SENT>
