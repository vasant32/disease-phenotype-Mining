<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of a series of 15 adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011664'>non-compaction cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included a total of 15 patients aged 52 ± 17 years (40% males) diagnosed at our echocardiography laboratory between January 2001 and July 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The form of presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in 53% of subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in 20%o, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 13%o and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 7%&gt; </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 66 ± 11 mm and estimated ejection fraction was 27 ± 10%&gt; </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apical and/or mid-ventricular segments of the left ventricle were involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>Pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> was present in 40%o </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up was 19 months and no patient died during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty seven percent of the patients had manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, 27%o presented sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and 20%&gt; had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or flutter, whereas 13%o had cerebral embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An automated internal cardioverter defibrillator was implanted in 47%o of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011664'>Non-compaction cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is associated with high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is made in advanced stages of the disease, with significant dilation and ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
