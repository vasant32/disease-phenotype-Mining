<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications occurred in 28 patients (21.4%), 4 of them were excluded because of the absence of neuroimaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 21 patients the underlying cardiac pathology was valve disease and in the remaining 3 patients was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>11 patients had native valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and 10 prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cultured bacteria were Streptococcus viridans in 8 cases and Staphylococcus aureus in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent complication was cerebrovascular with incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> of 62.5% and 8.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic evidence of vegetation was seen in 18 patients, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> were noted in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 29% of patients with neurologic complications and 27% without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of nine patients who underwent open-heat surgery died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that there is no difference in the incidence of neurologic complications between mitral and aortic valve groups, neither when comparing native and prosthetic valve groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Open-heart surgery does not increase mortality in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
