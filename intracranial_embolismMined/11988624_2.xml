<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Even after extensive evaluation, the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> remains undefined in a considerable proportion of cases, suggesting that causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may exist that have not yet been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (PVT) is a potential source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> in patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF REPORT: Within 7 days after mild to moderately severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, 18 patients (9 women, 9 men; mean age, 48 years) were studied in whom the etiology remained undefined despite complete workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received high-resolution pulmonary venography with the use of multiple-bolus, multiphase, 3-dimensional, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall quality of the MRA was good in 14 and insufficient in 4 patients, mainly as a result of breathing artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visualization of the main and segmental veins and evaluability of their patency were good for most right pulmonary veins but often inadequate for left pulmonary veins, particularly for those in the left lower lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for PVT in any of the sufficiently visualized pulmonary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support the hypothesis of PVT as a contributor to the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the study was limited regarding scan volume, spatial discrimination, patient selection, and delay between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, further investigations, including postmortem studies, are needed to resolve the question of whether PVT may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
