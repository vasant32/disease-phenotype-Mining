<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation during coil placement in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> is important in minimizing periprocedural morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on seven cases in which the primary treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation during such coil placement was intra-arterial abciximab infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and radiologic records of 100 consecutive patients who underwent coil placement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> at our institution during a 1-year period were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified seven cases (four ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, three unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>) in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation occurred during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intra-arterial abciximab infusion, up to 5 mg, completely dissolved the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in four of seven patients and almost completely dissolved it in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient with distal emboli, recanalization was not achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients, an intravenous bolus of abciximab without 12-hour infusion was also given adjunctively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient, leakage of contrast material occurred; this was related to the intra-arterial infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinically, no new neurologic deficits were directly related to the intra-arterial abciximab infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients had good clinical outcome, and one patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Relatively low-dose, intra-arterial abciximab infusion can immediately dissolve an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> that forms during <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> coil placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although neither the optimal dose of intra-arterial abciximab nor the need to supplement the intra-arterial infusion with intravenous administration was established, we preliminarily found that low-dose intra-arterial abciximab infusion may be relatively effective and safe in this setting, even in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
