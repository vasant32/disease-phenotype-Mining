<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was studied with optical density methods in a group of 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and in age, sex, and race-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided at age 60 into young <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and young controls (18 pairs) and old <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and old controls (21 pairs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A semiquantitative measure of the threshold of phase II of platelet aggregation and distinct of disaggregation 3 minutes after peak aggregation were used as an index of platelet aggregability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aggregability was significantly greater in young <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients than in young controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aggregability was similar in old <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and old controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both old <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and old controls were hyperaggregable compared with young controls, indicating that aggregability rises with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that platelet aggregability is significant risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but is relatively more important in the younger than in the older <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
