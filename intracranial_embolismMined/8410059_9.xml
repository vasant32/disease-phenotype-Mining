<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the nonbiologic materials, Antifoam A, which contains organosilicates and silicon, continues to be employed as an additive to prevent frothing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent improvements in filtration and oxygenation techniques have clearly reduced the incidence of large emboli and complications like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but other neurologic sequelae following open heart surgery are common and in many cases poorly explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recently developed histochemical technique for the demonstration of the endothelial alkaline phosphatase (AP) was employed in a post-mortem study of brains from 8 patients and 6 dogs dying within a few days after open heart surgery employing cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains from 38 patients and 6 dogs who were not subjected to heart surgery were studied as controls with the same technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The AP-stained slides are suitable for both light microscopic examination of the thick celloidin sections as well as a subsequent processing for high-resolution microradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small capillary and arteriolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> (SCADs) were seen in the test subjects/animals but not controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SCADs were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Approximately 50% of the SCADs showed birefringence when examined with polarized light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SCADs are putative embolic phenomena and the exact nature and source of the embolic material is under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> component is indicated by preliminary studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SCADs are difficult to find in routine paraffin sections and most if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the offending material seems to be dissolved during processing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
