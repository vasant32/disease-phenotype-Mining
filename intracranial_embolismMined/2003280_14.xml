<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> group included a higher frequency of women, older subjects, and those with a severe neurologic deficit, abnormal computed tomogram, and elevated heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 1-month case-fatality rate in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> group was 27% while that in the group without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 6-month case-fatality rates in the two groups were 40% and 20%, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were equally distributed in the two groups during both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is a negative prognostic factor in patients hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> alone does not completely explain the increase in mortality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
