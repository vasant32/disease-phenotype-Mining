<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We evaluated isovolumic hemodilution with hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> 200/0.5 in a rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This compound avoids the unfavorable viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation abnormalities of low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> during administration over a period of several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats, anesthetized with 0.5-1% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and 70% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>, were subjected to silicon cylinder (treated and control groups) or sham (sham group) embolization of the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after embolization, the treated group (n = 5) was infused with 11 ml/kg of 10% hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> 200/0.5, and the control (n = 5) and sham (n = 4) groups were infused with saline for 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the treated group, 7.1 ml/kg of blood was withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours, the animals were reanesthetized, and cerebral blood flow was determined with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alternative brain slices were either incubated with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume determination or frozen for ischemic volume and cerebral blood flow determination using autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hematocrit in the treated group was reduced from (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) 46 +/- 1% to 35 +/- 2% at 1.5 hours (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cortical blood flow was within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of 115-185 ml/min/100 g, except for the ischemic cortex in the embolized groups, treated and control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ischemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the treated group was reduced by 74% (p &lt; 0.05) and 89% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively, from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The treated and sham ischemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> 200/0.5 could be an effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> when administered early, because it reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and ischemic volumes from control values to levels indistinguishable from those of the sham group </plain></SENT>
