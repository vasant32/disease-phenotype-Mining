<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, focal lesions were induced in the hindlimb representation area of the parietal cerebral cortex in rats using the technique of photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Photothrombosis occurs after illumination of the brain through the intact skull following intravenous injection of the photosensitive dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This resulted in cortical lesions with a diameter of about 2 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to study alterations in the density of [3H]muscimol binding sites to GABAA receptors seven days after lesion induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reduced GABAA receptor binding (-13 to -27% of the control value) was found in layers II and III of remote exofocal regions in the ipsi- and contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduction was consistently more intense in the ipsilateral cortical areas than in those of the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using extracellular recordings, significant correlations between GABAA receptor binding and paired pulse inhibition could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present investigation demonstrates that focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> cause a widespread, functionally effective down-regulation of GABAA receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These postlesional changes may result from lesion-induced alterations in cortical connectivity </plain></SENT>
