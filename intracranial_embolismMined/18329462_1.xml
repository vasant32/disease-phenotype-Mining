<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cerebral microembolization is a well-recognized phenomenon after cardiac valve replacement, but the relative proportion of solid and gaseous emboli is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Particulate microemboli are thought to be the most damaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the use of multifrequency transcranial Doppler ultrasound, we compared the number and nature of microemboli in recipients of biologic and mechanical aortic valve prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The middle cerebral arteries of 60 patients were monitored bilaterally with a new-generation transcranial Doppler ultrasound (Embo-Dop, DWL Elektronische Systeme GmbH, Singen, Germany) that rejects artefacts online and automatically discriminates between solid and gaseous microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> recordings were performed during a 30-minute period 1 day before and at a mean of 5 days and 3 months after isolated aortic valve replacement with a biologic (30, group B) or mechanical (30, group M) prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients in group B were older, with a mean age of 70.6 +/- 9.7 years versus 55.4 +/- 9.4 years (P &lt; .005) in the patients in group M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biologic prosthesis recipients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> taking aspirin (no <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>); patients with mechanical valves were well anticoagulated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> both 5 days and 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had solid microemboli preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five days postoperatively, the absolute number of cerebral microemboli was 145 and 594 for total microemboli (P = .001) and 41 and 182 for solid microemboli (P = .002) in groups B and M, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, the absolute number was 65 and 608 for total microemboli (P &lt; .001) and 10 and 188 for solid microemboli (P &lt; .001) in groups B and M, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Solid microemboli accounted for 16% of the total microembolic load in group B compared with 31% in group M (P = .05) at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Solid cerebral microemboli represent approximately one third of the total cerebral microembolic load after mechanical aortic valve replacement and are detectable in the majority of such patients both 5 days and 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The neurofunctional consequences of this phenomenon should be carefully assessed </plain></SENT>
