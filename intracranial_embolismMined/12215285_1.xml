<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study whether recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) mediated foreign gene, LacZ, could pass the blood brain barrier by intra-carotid artery delivery and express in vivo in ischemic brain of the focal embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats to investigate a possibility of delivering foreign gene through carotid artery to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The carotid artery territory in 41 rats was embolized with or without arterial-like fibrin rich clots to make a model of focal embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>rAAV containing LacZ gene (rAAV-LacZ) was constructed in 293 cells by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9679">calcium phosphate</z:chebi> cotransfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were assigned to one of the following treatments: 1 control (without embolism) groups, including PBS treated (n = 6), pLacZ treated (n = 6 ) and rAAV-LacZ treated (n = 6): 2 embolic groups, including embolism + PBS (n =7),embolism + pLacZ (n = 8) and embolism + rAAV-LacZ (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains were cryosectioned and kappa-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> stain was performed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively, after transfection, and then <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured and the percentage of LacZ staining-positive cells was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the control groups and embolism + PBS treated animal, no kappa-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> staining-positive cells were found, but in embolism + pLacZ (n = 8) and embolism+rAAV-LacZ groups a lot of kappa-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> staining-positive cells were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression cells were in the tissues around the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gene expression persisted only nearly four weeks in embolic group with pLacZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the embolic group with rAAV-LacZ the expression was very stable during the experiment course (eight weeks) and the percentage of the expressed cells was significantly higher than that of its contralateral areas at the same time points, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The plasmid vector and rAAV could enter the brain through the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-damaged blood barrier and foreign gene can be expressed in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The positive gene expression is mainly in the peripheral areas of the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>rAAV as a permanent expression vector may ultimately be used for gene therapy of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> cerebravascular diseases </plain></SENT>
