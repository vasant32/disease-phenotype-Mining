<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spontaneous echo contrast in cardiac chamber has been indicated as a source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nature of the echocardiographic smokelike signal is still not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to regenerate spontaneous echo contrast and verify its thromboembolic characters in an in vitro model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Spontaneous echo contrast was reproduced in an expansion chamber under low flow conditions in a close circulation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous echo contrast was monitored and recorded with a 2-dimensional cardiosonography system and a transcranial Doppler device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, clinically commonly encountered embolic materials such as whole-blood clots, platelet aggregate-rich plasma, air bubbles, and 100-mL <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline were injected into this monitored circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differentiation of spontaneous echo contrast from emboli was performed by both visual observations of the echo images and offline Doppler signal intensity analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average signal intensities produced by spontaneous contrast and injection of embolic materials and saline were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effect of Doppler-detected flow velocity on generation of spontaneous contrast was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Spontaneous echo contrast was reproduced at low flow settings (90 to 120 mL/min) in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in average signal intensity between the flow with spontaneous echo contrast and that without the echo (P=0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, injection of embolic materials or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline did not generate smokelike image but caused much higher average signal intensity than the flow with spontaneous contrast (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Injection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline also increased average signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that smokelike echo is a special echo phenomenon occurring at low flow situations and does not itself produce material capable of embolizing into the systemic circulation </plain></SENT>
