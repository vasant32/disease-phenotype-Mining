<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency left atrial catheter ablation has become a routine procedure for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess with preprocedural and postprocedural cerebral magnetic resonance imaging the thromboembolic risk, either silent or clinically manifest, in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The secondary end point was the identification of clinical or procedural parameters that correlate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 232 consecutive patients with paroxysmal or persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> who were candidates for radiofrequency left atrial catheter ablation were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein isolation or pulmonary vein isolation plus linear lesions plus atrial defragmentation with the use of irrigated-tip ablation catheters was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients underwent preprocedural and postablation cerebral magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A periprocedural symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> occurred in 1 patient (0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postprocedural cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was positive for new embolic lesions in 33 patients (14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No clinical parameters such as age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and preablation antithrombotic treatment showed significant correlation with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procedural parameters such as activated clotting time value and, in particular, electric or pharmacological cardioversion to sinus rhythm correlated with an increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardioversion was also associated with an increased risk of 2.75 (95 confidence interval, 1.29 to 5.89; P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency left atrial catheter ablation carries a low risk of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> but is associated with a substantial risk of silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> detected on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> are the level of activated clotting time and, in particular, the electric or pharmacological cardioversion to sinus rhythm during the procedure </plain></SENT>
