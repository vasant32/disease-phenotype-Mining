<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The case was a 63-year old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0865577" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve failure</z:e>, who suddenly had <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> and right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The left carotid angiography performed six hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> demonstrated middle cerebral arterial axis occlusion, and the second angiography performed three days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> displayed recanalization of the initially occluded artery as well as extravasation of the contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> the patient died and an autopsy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain demonstrated perivascular punctate <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> in the area supplied by the middle cerebral artery, and neither <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333101" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microaneurysm</z:e> was disclosed pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A short discussion is given on the possible relationship between recanalization and hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
