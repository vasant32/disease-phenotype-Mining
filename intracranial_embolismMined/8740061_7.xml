<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relation between the presence and number of emboli signals and valve type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with six types of prosthetic valves (Björk-Shiley monostrut, Medtronic-Hall, Carbomedics, ATS, Carpentier-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> standard, Carpentier-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> supraannular) were examined using transcranial Doppler ultrasound in two centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The monitoring time was 30 min over the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were stabilized on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> at the time of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microemboli signals were identified by their characteristic audiovisual signal and on subsequent spectral analysis, based on accepted criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A standard neurologic questionnaire was completed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of microemboli signals varied between 49% (Medtronic Hall) and 97% (Björk-Shiley monostrut), while their number varied between 1 [0-3] (Carpentier-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> standard) and 187 [136-240] (Björk-Shiley monostrut) per hour (median and 95% CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both parameters were significantly higher in patients with Björk-Shiley monostrut valves compared to the other patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the prevalence of neurologic complications among the groups examined (overall 16%), or in emboli numbers between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and quantity of microemboli signals in patients with prosthetic heart valves, as detected by transcranial Doppler, is dependent upon valve type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of these microemboli signals remains to be further evaluated </plain></SENT>
