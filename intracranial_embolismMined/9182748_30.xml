<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While verbal comprehension is often impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> due to left hemispheric damage, the status of nonverbal conceptual knowledge of objects remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested 16 aphasic subjects for their comprehension of concrete single words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight showed significant impairment on word-to-picture matching, when distractors were semantically and not just perceptually confusable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 8 also made errors in answering verbal probe questions concerning the same items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When tested on a nonverbal pictorial version of the same probe questions, however, 3 of these 8 improved their performance to the level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other 5 showed continuing impairment in indicating responses to pictorial probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These 5 showed no evidence of generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>intellectual impairment</z:hpo>, and it is concluded that they demonstrated a comprehension deficit not limited to the verbal domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unlike the other aphasic patients, these latter 5 also had CT scan lesions extending into the posterior left temporal lobe (involving Brodmann's areas 22, 21, and 37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were also more impaired in terms of general <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that a nonverbal (as well as verbal) semantic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> occurs in a subgroup of patients with single word comprehension disturbance due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, and this may reflect general severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo> as well as damage to certain localized brain regions </plain></SENT>
