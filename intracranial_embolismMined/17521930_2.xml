<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blinded, pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group of 102 CEA patients (76 men, mean age 66.8 years) was randomised to routine Asasantin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">Dipyridamole</z:chebi> 200mg/Aspirin 25mg) twice daily (group I; n=39), Asasantin plus 75 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> once daily (group II; n=33), or Asasantin plus Rheomacrodex (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran 40</z:chebi>) 100g/L iv; 500 ml (group III; n=30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery for the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was performed intra-operatively and during the second postoperative hour following CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were the rate of postoperative emboli and the occurrence of cerebrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoint was any adverse <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed 2 intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s (group II and III) and 1 postoperative minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (group I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison with placebo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> or Rheomacrodex in addition to Asasantin produced no significant reduction in the number of postoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the number of postoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and different antiplatelet regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications was not significantly different between the 3 APT groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the present study, we could not show a significant influence of different antiplatelet regimens on TCD detected postoperative embolization following CEA </plain></SENT>
