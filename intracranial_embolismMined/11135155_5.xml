<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We prospectively evaluated the effects of head position during cardiac deairing on the Doppler ultrasonography-detected cerebral microemboli in children and the association between the embolic counts and the clinical assessment of deairing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Children requiring exposure of the systemic ventricle under cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to Trendelenburg (-15 degrees ) and horizontal (0 degrees ) head positions during and after standard surgical deairing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complexity of repair was categorized as follows: group I consisted of single simple lesions, and group II consisted of multiple complex lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography identified high-intensity transient signals in the right middle cerebral artery within the first 5 minutes after aortic declamping (release) and from this ending period until cardiopulmonary bypass termination (residual) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic alterations after deairing were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A predefined 5-point scale was used by the surgeon for blinded assessment of deairing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-intensity transient signals were identified in 97% of 128 patients (aged 5 days to 17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median total high-intensity transient signal count was 60 (25th-75th quartiles, 14-189) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Head position or surgeon did not affect the rate of high-intensity transient signals (P &gt;.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the residual interval, occurrence of HITS in group I was less than that in group II (P &lt;.05), but there was no difference at release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of high-intensity transient signals and electrocardiographic alterations correlated with the clinical assessment of deairing (P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Trendelenburg head position as a complement of cardiac deairing in children does not decrease the cerebral microembolic load compared with the horizontal head position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cerebral microembolic count and the occurrence of electrocardiographic alterations usually increases when the surgeon is less confident in the efficacy of deairing </plain></SENT>
