<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a self-expanding stent for the recanalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic or dissecting intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients (mean age, 66 years; NIHSS score, 10-23) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic (n = 8) or dissecting occlusion (n = 1) of the intracranial arteries (ICA terminus in 5, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in 3, and BA in 1) were treated with a recapturable self-expanding stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of the stent for recanalization were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The emboli were entrapped against the vessel wall by the stent, resulting in immediate recanalization (TIMI 2) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> embolic occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dissecting occlusion was recanalized completely (TIMI 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjunctive thrombolytics (n = 8, urokinase, 100,000-300,000 U) and/or GP IIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (n = 7, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi>, 0.5-1 mg) were administered intra-arterially, and the degree of recanalization further improved in 4 embolic occlusions (TIMI 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred in 2 patients, who received only urokinase without GP IIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both of the reoccluded arteries were reopened, by stent recapture in 1 and by intra-arterial administration of GP IIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recapture was attempted in 7 cases, of which there were 3 successful outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was 1 asymptomatic hemorrhagic conversion at the infarction site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean improvement of the NIHSS score between baseline and discharge was 12.3 (range, 3-22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results of this study suggest that a self-expanding stent may be safe and efficient for recanalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic or dissecting intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
