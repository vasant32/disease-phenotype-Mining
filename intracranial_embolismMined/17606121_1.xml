<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the various systems proposed for cerebral protection, transcervical CAS avoids crossing the lesion without protection and eliminates the complications associated with transfemoral access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes our experience and the results obtained with a transcervical stenting technique for carotid revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2005 to June 2006, 62 CAS were performed in our center in high-risk patients with &gt;70% stenosis (38.7% had a previous neurologic event and 61.3% were asymptomatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indications for CAS were severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (45.1%), severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> (6.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> of the contralateral laryngeal nerve (6.4%), recurrent stenosis (3.2%), and high carotid lesion (1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were &gt;80 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A complete neurologic examination was performed by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neurologist in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before and after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protection system used was carotid flow reversal by transcervical access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring was done during the procedure in 35 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We analyzed technical success, the presence of high-intensity transient signals during the procedure, neurologic morbidity and mortality at 30 days and 6 months, and stent patency at 6 months (range, 1 to 18 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Technical success was 96.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perioperative high-intensity transient signals were observed in two patients (5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the immediate postoperative period, one patient had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> of the anterior cerebral artery and another had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At 48 hours after discharge, a third patient returned to the hospital with a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> that required surgical drainage; hence, neurologic morbidity was 4.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among the total, 98.4% of the stents remained patent, two showed restenosis of 50% to 70%, and one restenosis of &gt;70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No patients presented a neurologic event during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcervical carotid artery stenting with flow reversal cerebral protection is a relatively simple, safe technique that avoids instrumentation of the aortic arch and crossing the target lesion without protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is less expensive than techniques requiring a filter device and provides excellent outcome with an acceptable incidence of complications </plain></SENT>
