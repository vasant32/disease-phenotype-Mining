<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Foam generated by manual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> of liquid sclerosant with air or gas is routinely utilized to treat refluxing veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although generally well tolerated, serious neurological events have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The composition and properties of the foam, including bubble size and gaseous components, may contribute to the potential for microcirculatory obstruction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested an ultra-low nitrogen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46859">polidocanol</z:chebi> endovenous microfoam with controlled bubble size and density and hypothesized that patients at risk due to the presence of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bubble emboli during microfoam injection would not demonstrate evidence of clinical or subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with great saphenous vein incompetence were treated with ultra-low nitrogen (≤ 0.8%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46859">polidocanol</z:chebi> endovenous microfoam injected under ultrasound guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> were included to evaluate the safety of cerebral arterial bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> emboli detected by transcranial Doppler during endovenous microfoam ablation received intensive surveillance for microinfarction, including brain magnetic resonance imaging and measurement of cardiac troponin-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bubble emboli were detected in 60 of 82 treated patients; 22 patients had no detectable emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bubbles detected, 49 (82%) had ≤ 15 bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients developed magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, neurological signs, or elevated cardiac troponin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with foamed liquid sclerosants are commonly exposed to cerebrovascular gas bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this series of 60 high-risk patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bubble emboli during or after treatment with ultra-low nitrogen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46859">polidocanol</z:chebi> endovenous microfoam, there was no evidence of cerebral or cardiac microinfarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of this study cannot be generalized to foams compounded using bedside methodologies, since the composition of these foams is substantially different </plain></SENT>
