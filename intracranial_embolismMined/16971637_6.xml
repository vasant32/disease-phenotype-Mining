<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that real-time <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain can be performed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> thrombolysis and can provide real-time feedback and guidance on the success of thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were induced in 5 adult dogs by the use of autologous blood clots, with a sixth dog serving as an experimental control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> anatomic and physiologic imaging was performed to track the evolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and quantitative cerebral blood flow (qCBF) were compared in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During and after the administration of a chemical thrombolytic agent, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed to assess the outcome of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> were successfully created in 5 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> or qCBF changes were observed in the control animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and qCBF values were found to be significantly different in the region affected by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Restoration of flow was observed in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have successfully implemented an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging-compatible canine model of reversible embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
