<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The occurrence of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has already been described, but the diagnostic and prognostic value of this finding is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 90 consecutive patients admitted for their first hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 72 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them underwent 30-minute bilateral transcranial Doppler monitoring of middle cerebral arteries, within 72 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The monitoring was repeated after an additional 24 hours and after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then classified the episodes in the following etiologic categories: cardioembolic, atherothrombotic, small-vessel disease, mixed cases, unknown origin, and other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 75 patients, with a mean interval of registration of 32.04 +/- 19.39 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 9 patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were recorded only on the symptomatic middle cerebral artery, and the majority were recorded during the first or the second registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found in risk factors and hematologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients (56%) had atherothrombotic episodes, 3 patients (33%) had cardioembolic episodes, and 1 patient (11%) had a protein S deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> had small-vessel disease (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> are an infrequent finding in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 72 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, but they can be recorded more easily with serial registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our patients, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were found only on the symptomatic middle cerebral artery and were present in atherothrombotic and cardioembolic episodes but not in small-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
