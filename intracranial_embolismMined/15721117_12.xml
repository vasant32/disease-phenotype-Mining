<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The investigators sought to determine whether there is an increased incidence of IAB in patients with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients' medical records were reviewed for evidence of embolic cerebrovascular events and IAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred four patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 61 patients in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm, 49 (80%) had IAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was almost twice the prevalence of 2 previous studies (41% and 47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, IAB may represent a new risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
