<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in dog proved to be fruitless, we eventually succeeded in producing focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by temporary occlusions of brain arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infarction confined to the anterior portion of the thalamus was obtained by simultaneous occlusion of four arteries for 60 or 120 minutes: internal carotid, anterior cerebral, middle cerebral and posterior communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This experimental model in dogs is unique, since a marked infarction can be seen in high frequency, and the dogs can be managed for sufficient periods after temporary clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it is possible to investigate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> not only from the pathophysiological viewpoint, but also for its prevention and treatment </plain></SENT>
