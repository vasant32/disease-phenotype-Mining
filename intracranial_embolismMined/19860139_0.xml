<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, tools detecting bubbles in the vasculature may be important for evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sheep were air-compressed to 6.0 ATA (30 minutes bottom time) then rapidly decompressed to the surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A fundus camera was quickly positioned for continuous observation of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bubbles were observed in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vasculature of 25.8% (n = 31) of the sheep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bubble <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time ranged from 5-22 minutes post-chamber and lodge time ranged from 0-70+ minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bubbles were visualized mostly in the arteries of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe vasoconstriction was captured using red-free angiography in two sheep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two other sheep, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography demonstrated occluded blood flow caused by arterial gas emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> angiography is a practical tool for real-time, noninvasive detection of bubbles in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> circulation, a visible window to the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> angiography may prove invaluable in the early detection of arterial gas emboli in the cerebral circulation, the resolution of which is imperative to favorable neurological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study also presents for the first time images of bubbles in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> circulation associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> captured by a fundus camera </plain></SENT>
