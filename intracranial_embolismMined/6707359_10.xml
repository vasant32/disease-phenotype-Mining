<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (10%) with aortic valve replacement and 24 (16%) with mitral valve replacement died early postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mortality remained high (31%) in the first 3 years after aortic valve replacement; it was highest (13%) in the first year after mitral valve replacement and then approached the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> after aortic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> after mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 76% of survivors had improved symptomatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three instances of primary valve malfunction occurred </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Starr-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> valve prosthesis is durable over prolonged follow-up period, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> remains a persistent problem </plain></SENT>
