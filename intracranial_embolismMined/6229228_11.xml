<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient's plasma was markedly deficient in both prostacyclin stimulating factor (PSF) and vascular plasminogen activator (VPA), and also contained a potent inhibitor of in vitro urokinase-induced fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with ancrod resulted in striking reversal of the progressive renal damage and clinical recovery from the thrombotic cerebrovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007863'>retinal lesions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This clinical improvement was associated with improved renal histologic appearance, correction of the PSF and VPA deficiencies, and disappearance of the urokinase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanisms of action of ancrod are discussed </plain></SENT>
