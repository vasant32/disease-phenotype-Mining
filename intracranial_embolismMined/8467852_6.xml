<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to analyze clinical features of cerebrovascular complications in infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and to establish the appropriate time schedule of chemotherapy and cardiosurgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the clinical data of 123 patients with active infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> of native valves retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients (18 males and 15 females, age 17-57 years) had cerebrovascular complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (n = 22) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of complications (21 ischemic and 13 hemorrhagic episodes) occurred prior to or within 1 month after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fatal neurological deterioration developed after cardiac surgery in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both of them needed emergency cardiac surgery, because of worsening hemodynamic state, which was performed within 5 days after cerebral embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients undertaking cardiac surgery did <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survive; in whom there were chemotherapeutic intervals of 11 days after ischemic events or of 23 days after hemorrhagic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These medical records suggest that early cardiosurgical intervention, if necessary, needs at least 2-3 weeks of preceding chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cases undergoing more than 1 month of chemotherapy, cerebrovascular complications may be well managed by medical treatment alone </plain></SENT>
