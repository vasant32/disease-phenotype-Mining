<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First strategy, supplemented with combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> and aspirin prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and lethal outcome most successfully, while the use of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was unexpectedly associated with comparative elevation of risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
