<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence that this causes problems in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there may be implications if a similar reduction occurs in patients recovering from an ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in whom local blood flow has already been reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler provides a non-invasive method for measuring changes in middle cerebral artery (mca) blood velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A method for obtaining consistent. reliable measurements was developed and used in a double blind, randomized, crossover study on 20 patients (18 M, 2 F; mean age 70) recovering from ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the mca territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery blood velocity was measured bilaterally using transcranial Doppler before and after 250 mg <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> (equivalent to about two cups of filter coffee) or matched placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">Caffeine</z:chebi> caused an average 12% reduction in blood velocity compared to placebo in the hemisphere affected by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (95%c CI 8%-16%, p &lt; 0.00001), and a 12% reduction in the non-affected hemisphere (95% CI 6%-18%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications are unclear at present, and imaging techniques will be required to establish whether <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> does reduce flow to hypo-perfused regions </plain></SENT>
