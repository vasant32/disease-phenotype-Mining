<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because there is no proof that in the early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> the changes are irreversible, and because in a significant proportion of cases the heart is simultaneously injured, both stellate ganglion block and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy seem justified </plain></SENT>
