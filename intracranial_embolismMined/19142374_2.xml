<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cardioembolic (CE) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is an important clinical manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> chagasic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e>; however, its incidence and the risk factors associated to this event have yet to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine prevention strategies for a common and devastating complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e>, the cardioembolic (CE) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1,043 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> were prospectively evaluated from 03/1990 to 03/2002 and followed up to 03/2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox regression was performed to create the CE risk score that was related with the annual incidence of this event: 4-5 points--&gt;4%; 3 points--2-4%; 2 points--1-2%; 0-1 points--&lt;1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy and safety of two treatment cohorts: (1) 52 patients who used <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (INR 2-3) for 14+/-14 months; (2) 104 patients who used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) (200 mg/d) for 22+/-21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group (1), the risk of a major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> that needed blood transfusion was 1.9% a year, without CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression was used to identify 4 independent variables associated to the event (systolic dysfunction, apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, primary alteration of ventricular repolarization and age &gt; 48 years) and an CE risk score was developed, which was associated with the annual incidence of this event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group (2) there were no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications and the annual incidence of CE was 3.2%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them in patients with 4-5 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on the risk-benefit analysis, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> prophylaxis for cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> is recommended for patients with a score of 4-5 points, in whom the risk of CE overweighs the risk of a major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a 3-point score, the risks of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and CE are the same, so the medical decision of using either <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> has to be an individual one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with a low risk of CE (2-point score) either <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> or no therapy can be chosen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prophylaxis is not necessary in patients with 0-1 point scores, in whom the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence is near zero </plain></SENT>
