<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immediately after successful cardioversion, however, left atrium or left atrial appendage stunning may be present, potentially carrying a risk for de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the presence of spontaneous contrast is considered as a contraindication for unanticoagulated cardioversion since it has been associated with postcardioversion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a case in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> developed in relation to unanticoagulated cardioversion regardless of careful prior evaluation with TEE </plain></SENT>
