<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed criteria for emboli detection using PMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, we performed a blinded comparison of transcranial PMD with single-gate spectral TCD in TCD bubble study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> as detected with standard TCD were selected for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The international emboli criteria for spectral TCD were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We defined novel PMD criteria for detecting emboli signature on PMD as follows: (1) signature at least 3 dB higher than the highest spontaneous PMD display of background blood flow; (2) embolic signature reflects motion in one direction at a minimum spatial extent of 7.5 mm and temporal extent of 30 ms; (3) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> must traverse a prespecified depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each study was blindly assessed for microbubble signals (MBS) count on either modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 44.4 (SD 14.4), 50% were male, and median time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to TCD bubble test was 12 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median MBS count in middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was 4 on both modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Spectral TCD MBS counts were highly correlated (rho=0.97) with PMD MBS counts in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and similarly in anterior cerebral arteries (ACA) (rho=0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When PMD microbubble counts in the ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were summed, a clear 2-fold difference emerged between 2 modalities (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When compared with spectral TCD, PMD detects more MBS with higher counts by identifying ACA as well as <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pitfalls of overcounting emboli with PMD can be avoided by following such criteria </plain></SENT>
