<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three ml of 1.4 M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> solution were perfused through the right carotid artery of a rat, and the opening of the blood-brain barrier was examined by using EVans blue as a tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The barrier was opened for 60-120 minutes and then reestablished without gross neurological defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, however, edematous change and microinfarcts were often observed, which might be due to microembolism of recrystallized <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With filtration of the perfusate through a millipore filter, the blood-brain barrier was reversibly opened without any tissue damages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This could be a useful therapeutic technique and an experimental model for neurotoxicology </plain></SENT>
