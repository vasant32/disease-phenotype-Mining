<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the time course of changes in MRI findings of multiple cerebral microembolism, the authors induced experimental multiple microinfarctions in rats using microspheres and then examined sequential MRI and histopathologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors also evaluated how the amount of injected embolic materials affected the findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors injected 25-microm microspheres (range, 2000-8000 gm) into the unilateral internal carotid arteries of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were assessed by MRI and histopathology at 1 day or 8 days after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One day after embolization, multiple high-intensity areas on T2-weighted images were related to the number of injected microspheres and were associated with regions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> on histopathologic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 8, the high-intensity areas on T2-weighted images observed on day 1 were markedly diminished in the groups receiving up to 6000 microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group injected with 8000 microspheres, however, the high-intensity areas were less diminished, and these areas were significantly larger than in the other groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The MRI features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> or infarction induced by microsphere embolism vary depending on the number of injected microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> has a threshold based on ischemic cell volume </plain></SENT>
