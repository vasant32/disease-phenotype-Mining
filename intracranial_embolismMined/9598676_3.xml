<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is used to protect the brain from ischaemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study explores the use of microdialysis to measure metabolic indices of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and pH, and cerebral temperature during profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Effluent from a microdialysis catheter placed in the cerebral cortex of three patients undergoing complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was continuously sampled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples were pooled over 10 minute periods and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentrations were measured postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain temperature and pH were measured on line intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalography and monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were simultaneously carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient 1 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PH was 6.75 to 6.85 and increased to 6.9 after warming ensued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 had raised <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> during most measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentrations peaked at 305 microM/l at the start of the measurements and fell below 20 microM/l after warming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentrations peaked at 680 microM/l before cooling, rose to 1040 microM/l during the cooling process, decreased to 212 microM/l during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, and rose again to 620 microM/l after warming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pH started at 7.06 and continued a downward course until stabilising at a pH of 6.5 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patient 3 had a transient, mild increase in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> during the cooling and warming period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>pH was stable throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Microdialysis combined with temperature and pH measurements of the cerebral cortex promises to be an important tool in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to validate our findings and test the feasibility of modifying ischaemic changes </plain></SENT>
