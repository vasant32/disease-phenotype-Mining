<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS) is a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to find out the frequency of the HMCAS, its association with initial neurological severity and early parenchymal ischemic changes on CT, its relevance to clinical outcome, and the efficacy of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in patients with the HMCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Secondary analysis of the data from 620 patients who received either rtPA or placebo in the European Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study I (ECASS I), a double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline CT scans were obtained within 6 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional and neurological outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale and the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale at day 90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found an HMCAS in 107 patients(17.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial neurological deficit was more severe in patients with the HMCAS than in those lacking this sign (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and mass effect were also more common in patients with the HMCAS (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HMCAS was related to the risk of poor functional outcome (grade of 3 to 6 on the modified Rankin Scale) on univariate analysis: 90 patients (84%) with the HMCAS and 310 patients (62%) lacking this sign were dependent or dead at day 90 (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, this association was no longer significant in a logistic model accounting for the effect of age, sex, treatment with rtPA, initial severity of neurological deficit and early parenchymal ischemic changes on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with the HMCAS who were given rtPA had better neurological recovery than those who received placebo (P=0.0297) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The HMCAS is associated with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and poor functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, it has no significant independent prognostic value when accounting for the effect of initial severity of neurological deficit and of early parenchymal ischemic changes on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with the HMCAS may benefit from intravenous rtPA </plain></SENT>
