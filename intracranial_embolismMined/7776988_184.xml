<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal intensity of oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy for patients with mechanical heart valves (i.e., the level at which thromboembolic complications are effectively prevented without excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>) is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to determine the optimal intensity by calculating the incidence of both complications at different levels of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with mechanical heart valves who have been seen at four regional Dutch anticoagulation clinics since 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome events were episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> or major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intensity-specific incidence of each type of event was calculated as the number of events that occurred at a certain intensity of anticoagulation (expressed in terms of the international normalized ratio [INR]) divided by the number of patient-years during which the INR was at this level in the total patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1608 patients were followed during 6475 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral embolism</z:e> occurred in 43 patients (0.68 per 100 patient-years) and peripheral embolism in 2 (0.03 per 100 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracranial and <z:mp ids='MP_0006054'>spinal bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 36 patients (0.57 per 100 patient-years) and major extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in 128 (2.1 per 100 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The optimal intensity of anticoagulation, at which the incidence of both complications was lowest, was achieved when the INR was between 2.5 and 4.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy for patients with prosthetic heart valves is optimal when the INR is between 2.5 and 4.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To achieve this level of anticoagulation, a target INR of 3.0 to 4.0 is recommended </plain></SENT>
