<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been shown previously that cerebral microemboli may occur frequently in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mechanical heart valve (MHV) without prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some arguments strongly suggest that these microemboli have a gaseous origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In other circumstances such as extracorporeal circulation or decompression in divers, it has been demonstrated that cerebral microbubbles could lead to some deterioration in cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have studied attention and memory, which are among the most impaired cognitive functions as demonstrated in previous studies, in patients with an MHV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups of 12 volunteers each were composed of patients with an MHV and embolic signals in the cerebral circulation (group 1), patients with biological prostheses (group 2), and healthy subjects (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Groups were carefully matched for age and verbal intellectual abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each group, a transcranial Doppler examination was performed and a set of cognitive tests assessing sustained and selective attention and episodic and working memory was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean embolic rate was 29 per hour in patients with an MHV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was detected in the other 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Episodic memory was significantly modified in both groups 1 and 2 compared with the control group for tasks that required high-processing resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Working memory performance was significantly decreased in MHV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No between-groups differences were observed for the other parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alteration of episodic memory can be attributed to a long-term effect of the surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Deterioration of working memory can be related to the presence of cerebral microemboli in MHV patients </plain></SENT>
