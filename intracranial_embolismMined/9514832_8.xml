<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that the likelihood and severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were significantly correlated with the magnitude of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hypertensive response to embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was not clear, however, whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> actually caused <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or was merely a marker of more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current studies, we attempted to clarify the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and HT by either pharmacologically inducing or attenuating the brief hypertensive response to embolization in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia, two catheters were implanted in the right carotid arteries of male New Zealand white rabbits, one oriented toward the heart and one toward the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were allowed to awaken and were embolized using blood clot emboli injected into the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was monitored via the second carotid catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was induced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, administered at the time of embolization or 1 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, we attempted to attenuate the hypertensive response using intravenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed 18 h after embolization and the brains evaluated for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> immediately after embolization did not increase the hypertensive response to embolization further than that spontaneously occurring, and no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>-related HT was observed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> (15 mg/kg) significantly reduced the number of brain sections with visible HT, from 3.2 +/- .5 in controls to 1.6 +/- .4 in treated animals </plain></SENT>
