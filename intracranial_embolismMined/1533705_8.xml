<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between free <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> and cerebrovascular disease by reviewing the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, and cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> who were referred for coagulation studies over a 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assayed for free protein S antigen, protein C antigen, and antithrombin III and tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of 267 patients (8.2%) admitted with thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were referred for coagulation studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Free protein S antigen was significantly lower in women than in men (62 +/- 25% versus 88 +/- 24%, p = 0.03; n = 11 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six women had free protein S antigen levels below the range recorded for a contemporary group of 24 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> women (17 to 59% versus 70 to 102%, p less than 0.001); four of these women had cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and two had venous dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The six women were aged 29 to 55 at the time of their first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>; two had family members with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, and one of these had died of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at age 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other abnormalities in this population included a positive test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or anticardiolipin in five patients, a modest decrease in protein S in two men, and one patient with an isolated deficiency of antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> may be an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in middle-aged women but this requires confirmation by prospective studies in unselected patients </plain></SENT>
