<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed at determining predictors of cerebral ischemic events associated with stenting for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 127 patients who had been studied by diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DWI) before and on the day after carotid stenting were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six clinical variables and 5 variables characterizing the target carotid artery and aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were analyzed as potential risk factors for new ipsilateral DWI lesions after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables assessed, only age, length of stenosis and carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) significantly modified the risk of new lesions after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age ≥68 years, stenosis ≥15 mm and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> ≥1.3 mm were identified as the best thresholds to predict new lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients ≥68 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> ≥15 mm in length and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> ≥1.3 mm, the risk of new lesions was markedly higher than in patients to whom no more than two of these factors applied (odds ratio 7.250, 95% CI 1.612-34.513, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of this simple predictive model correctly identified patients who had new lesions after stenting with high specificity (0.96) and a negative predictive value (0.83), while the positive predictive value was moderate (0.60) and sensitivity was low (0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of stenting for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> may vary with clinical and morphological patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to validate these results and to evaluate the safety of stenting versus endarterectomy in specific patient subgroups </plain></SENT>
