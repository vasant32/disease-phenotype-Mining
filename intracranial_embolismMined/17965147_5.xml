<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a new three dimensional (3D) MRI protocol for the reliable detection of aortic high risk plaques compared with transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) and to test the reliability of additional MRI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 74 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were examined by both TOE and MRI at 3 Tesla with special regard to aortic high risk plaques (ie, &gt; OR = 4 mm, superimposed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ECG synchronised pre- and post-contrast T1 weighted 3D imaging (spatial resolution approximately 1 mm3) covering the thoracic aorta was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In plaques &gt; OR = 3 mm, additional two dimensional T2 imaging and time resolved (CINE) imaging sequences were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aetiology of brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was classified according to modified TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic high risk embolic sources detected by MRI in patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Differences in maximum aortic wall thickness for TOE and MRI were not statistically significant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aortic segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall number of high risk plaques detected by MRI (n = 74) was substantially higher compared with TOE (n = 47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most noticeably, MRI identified aortic high risk pathologies in 8/26 (30.8%) patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after standard diagnostics, including TOE (n = 2: dissection or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>; n = 6: plaques &gt; OR = 4 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this 3D MRI protocol for the reliable detection of aortic high risk plaques in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of improved visualisation of the aortic arch and the detection of additional embolic sources not seen by standard diagnostics, this novel technique may become a valuable tool for future patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
