<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim has been to evaluate this shift in our county through the clinico-radiologic characteristics of the patients admitted to our unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over the last 7 years a total of 12 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were attended in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed retrospectively their clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 11 women 1 man with a range of ages from 13 to 60 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main associated factor was oral contraceptives intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of them presented with symptoms of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was the most sensitive diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome was good in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of them were treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and received oral anticoagulation for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More than half were diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the last three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data seem to confirm this tendency towards a larger number of cases with the application of new diagnostic tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In these cases, clinical course is more benign than reported in classical series </plain></SENT>
