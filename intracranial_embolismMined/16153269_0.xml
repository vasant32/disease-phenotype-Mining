<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Preceding selective cerebral perfusion (P-SCP) is a method whereby SCP and systemic perfusion start simultaneously, and the arch vessels are clamped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral circulation is isolated from systemic circulation to avoid cerebral embolization due to detachment of atherosclerotic material from the aorta, caused by the "sandblasting" effect of high-velocity jets of blood exiting the aortic cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, neither the safety of SCP at normothermia nor the influence of extended SCP time has been sufficiently clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify the safety of P-SCP, the comparison study of P-SCP and conventional SCP (C-SCP) was performed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-seven patients (C-SCP group: 29 patients; P-SCP: 28 patients) underwent surgery between 1992 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine (15.8%) in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred; 4 in the C-SCP group (13.8%) and 5 in the P-SCP group (17.9%) (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SCP time was 136.6 +/- 68.5 minutes in the C-SCP group and 195.8 +/- 30.7 minutes in the P-SCP group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient in each group exhibited postoperative neurological dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It may be little dangerous to initiate the SCP with normothermia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>P-SCP may be useful in cases in which there is pedunculated atherosclerotic material, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> in the ascending and arch aorta </plain></SENT>
