<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of occlusion of the intradural vertebrobasilar artery (OIDVBA) was made by means of cerebral angiography in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation, course and followup were studied in conjunction with the angiographic findings in each case and the following conclusions made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OIDVBA is not rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It occurs one-fourth as often as occlusion of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correct diagnosis is not made clinically before angiography in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete visualization of the neck and intracranial vasculature is necessary to document the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is the most common type of occlusive lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common predisposing factors are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and developmental vertebrobasilar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients with occlusion are in the 7th and 8th decades of life and transient attacks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar ischemia</z:e> precede the occlusion in one-half of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Emboli usually lodge in the terminal portion of the basilar artery whereas thrombotic occlusions tend not to be located in a characteristic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A majority of patients diagnosed angiographically survive their OIDVBA, but most distal occlusions result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, often following several weeks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the surviving majority, disturbance of gait, impairment of vision, and symptoms of transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar ischemia</z:e> are the most common sequelae </plain></SENT>
