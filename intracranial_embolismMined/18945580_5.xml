<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate this phenomenon, we have evaluated embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) after CAS and correlated them with aortic arch (AA) characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The AAs of 59 patients undergoing CAS under distal protection were evaluated by angiography and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AAs were stratified according to <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (type I and II "simple" vs type III and bovine "difficult"), atherosclerotic arch lesions (complicated: &gt;5 mm or with mobile debris vs uncomplicated: &lt;5 mm), and tortuosity index (TI; sum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> angles diverging from ideal carotid axis, &lt;150 vs &gt;150) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was performed before and within 24 hours from CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were considered ipsilateral (IL) if ipsilateral to the site of CAS and non-ipsilateral (CL) if contralateral to it or bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Normality distribution was by Shapiro-Wilk test (variables reported as medians +/- interquartile range) and statistical significance (P &lt; .05) by Wilcoxon and Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Difficult arches were present in 17 patients (28.8%), complicated aortic plaque in 21 (35.5%), and TI &gt; 150 in 34 (57.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> appeared in 34 or 57.6% patients (6 or 18% IL and 28 or 82% CL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was 5.7 (range, 0 to 20), 4.7 IL, and 5.7 CL, with a median volume of 560.95 +/- 1677.7 mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Type of arch and TI were not correlated with mean number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were greater in patients with difficult AA, complicated plaques, and TI &gt; 150 (258 (572) mm(3) vs 15.6 (353) mm(3), P = .2; and 86 (828) mm(3) vs 85.9 (352) mm(3), P = .4 172 (766) mm(3) vs 0 (228) mm(3), P = .06, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three AA characteristics, mean number and volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was significantly greater compared with other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Specifically, this increase was due mainly to CL (IL 0 (117) mm(3) vs 0 (172) mm(3), P = .9; CL 564 (687) mm(3) vs 0 (133) mm(3), P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>None of the technical details considered was correlated with either IL or CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> are frequent after protected CAS and are correlated with AA characteristics, thus underlining the role of catheterization maneuvers in determining embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>TEE may be useful in patient's selection for CAS </plain></SENT>
