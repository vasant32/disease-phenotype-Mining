<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article describes the design of CLOTBUST (combined lysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> using transcranial ultrasound and systemic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>), the first prospective international multicenter randomized clinical trial of noninvasive externally applied ultrasound to enhance systemic thrombolysis in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> eligible for intravenous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> therapy within 3 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> who have detectable middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on a prebolus TCD are included in this trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients receive standard 0.9 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients are randomized (1:1) to either 2 hours of continuous monitoring with TCD or placebo monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FDA-approved portable diagnostic TCD equipment and standard headframes (Marc series, Spencer Technologies, Seattle, WA) are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Output of TCD units is set at 100% power achievable at depths of insonation that display the worst TIBI flow grade signals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treating physicians are blinded to randomization assignment, and certified scorers measure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity using the National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Safety of continuous TCD monitoring is determined by rates of symptomatic (NIHSS score increase by 4+ points) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> within 72 hours after initial symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Potential enhancement of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> therapy will be determined using combined primary end-point of early complete recanalization on TCD (TIBI flow grades 4-5), dramatic recovery (NIHSS &lt; or = 3 points), or decline in the NIHSS &gt; or = 10 points repeatedly measured every 30 minutes within 2 hours after <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other end-points include recovery at 24 hours and 3 months, modified Rankin scores (mRS) are obtained at 90 days, and favorable outcome is determined as NIHSS or mRS scores 0-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The aim of phase II CLOTBUST trial is to determine the rates of early complete recanalization and dramatic/early clinical recovery in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> + TCD and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The sample size is set at 126 patients since a medium effect size (.50) is anticipated for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> + TCD group vs <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> alone to achieve combined primary end-point </plain></SENT>
