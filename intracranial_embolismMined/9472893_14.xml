<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are being used more frequently in patients in the absence of a large body of information on their histopathological effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study determined the efficacy and histopathological effects of treatment of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC) or cellulose <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> polymer (CAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen dogs had 13 terminal and 30 sidewall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> created with venous pouches sutured to the cervical carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two weeks later, dogs had angiography followed by randomization to no treatment (n=2) or to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion with GDC (n=4) or CAP (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two months later, angiography was repeated, animals were killed, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were excised, fixed, photographed, and examined by light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two dogs were excluded because of common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at 2-week angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 11 terminal and 16 sidewall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> available for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was 0% (0/5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with GDC showed complete terminal and sidewall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> obliteration rates of 33% (1/3) and 80% (4/5), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Greater than 90% occlusion occurred in the remaining cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no parent or branch <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CAP showed complete terminal and sidewall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> obliteration rates of 20% (1/5) and 0% (0/5), respectively, and incomplete sidewall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> obliteration in 1 of 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> reformed at 2 months in 2 of 5 terminal and 1 of 5 sidewall cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were parent or branch <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> with CAP in 2 and 4 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion was significantly lower and the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> significantly higher with CAP than with GDC (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Histopathology showed complete endothelialization across the orifice of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> successfully treated with CAP, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with GDC were significantly more likely to show fresh or organizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> without complete endothelialization (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that both treatments have limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Complete packing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with GDC obliterates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, but endothelialization does not always occur within 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There are substantial problems with CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It is thrombogenic and carries a higher risk of causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Even if an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is successfully obliterated initially with CAP, the CAP may disappear, leaving the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> completely untreated </plain></SENT>
