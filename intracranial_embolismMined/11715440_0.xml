<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 10,173 cases of CPB surgery, analysed risk factors of CVDC after CPB surgery in comparison with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After CPB surgery, the general morbidity of neurological complications (NC) was 1.44% (146/10,173), of which CVDC accounted for 59.58% (87/146) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the CVDC group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> accounted for 39.09%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> 28.74%, cerebral haemorrhage 11.49%, prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (PVE) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> 10.34%, and others 10.35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 44 patients of the NC group, in which CVDC went to 47.72% (21/44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic clump time and CPB time were greatly longer in the CVDC group than controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The main postoperative neurological complications after CPB surgery are CVDC, most of which are ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative CVDC correlates with longer aortic clump time and CPB time during the operation </plain></SENT>
