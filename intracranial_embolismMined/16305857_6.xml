<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main aim of this study was to compare off-pump and on-pump surgery with regard to the frequency of new postoperative cerebral ischemic lesions and the prevalence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also assessed whether preoperative cerebral ischemic injury predicts the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> were prospectively randomized to undergo off-pump or on-pump surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A detailed neuropsychological assessment and a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging examination were performed on the day before and at 3 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological assessment was repeated at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant (p = 0.17) difference between off-pump (8.2%) and on-pump (17.3%) surgery with regard to new postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> after surgery was also similar in the two groups (3 months: off-pump 20.4%, on-pump 23.1%, p = 0.74; 12 months: off-pump 24.1%, on-pump 23.1%, p = 0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of preoperative cerebral ischemic injury was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> after on-pump (p = 0.02) but not after off-pump (p = 0.22) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> preoperative radiologic findings were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> at 3 months postoperatively (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term cognitive function and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of brain injury were similar after off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperative cerebral magnetic resonance imaging can be used to predict the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery </plain></SENT>
