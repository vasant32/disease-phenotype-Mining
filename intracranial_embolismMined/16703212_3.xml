<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this report is to explore angioplasty and stenting with cerebral embolic protection as a salvage procedure for a compromised carotid-subclavian bypass in the presence of antegrade vertebral artery flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 76-year-old woman with a carotid-subclavian bypass presented with graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Failure of medical therapy to treat the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> prompted surgical removal of the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The native subclavian artery was still patent, but a severe complex proximal stenosis was present with antegrade flow into the left vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty and stenting of the subclavian artery was performed with cerebral protection achieved by positioning a FilterWire EX in the left vertebral artery via the left brachial artery approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deployment of a filter device in the vertebral artery via the brachial or radial approach can provide embolic protection without interfering with the subclavian artery stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The successful treatment of the subclavian artery enabled the complete removal of the infected graft without need for major vascular reconstruction </plain></SENT>
