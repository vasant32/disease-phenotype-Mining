<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Owing to the significant incidence of peripheral or cerebral vascular embolic events in this group of patients, the Authors conclude that long-term anticoagulation therapy is mandatory in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, whereas a surgical repair could be advisable when a previous embolism or interatrial shunting is demonstrated </plain></SENT>
