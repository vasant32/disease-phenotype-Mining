<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From October 1978 to August 1994, 122 consecutive patients were operated on during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 85 men and 37 women whose mean age was 50 years, ranging from 20 to 79 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgery was needed because of one or more of the following complications: cardiogenic/septic shock in 19 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> in 68, persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in 64, peripheral embolization in 20, and cerebral embolization in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The offending microorganism was identified in 110 patients, staphylococci were the most common ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six patients had native valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and 46 had prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simple valve replacement or repair was performed in 60 patients and radical resection of the valve and surrounding tissues with reconstruction of the heart with either fresh autologous pericardium or glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium was performed in 62 with paravalvular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary autograft and aortic homograft were used in only three patients, the remaining patients had either bioprostheses or mechanical heart valves if valve repair was not feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, for an operative mortality of 7.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis identified preoperative shock and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> as predictors of operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Operative survivors were followed up from 4 to 173 months, mean of 56.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival at 10 years was 61 +/- 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis identified preoperative New York Heart Association functional class IV and perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> as predictors of late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eight patients developed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> 10-102 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The freedom from recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> at 10 years was 79 +/- 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who developed this late complication had paravalvular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> at the time of original operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that surgery for active infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> yield a high probability of eradicating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with relatively low operative mortality and good long-term results </plain></SENT>
