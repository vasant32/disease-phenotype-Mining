<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Doppler findings were compared with cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Doppler sonography was highly reliable for both detection and exclusion of high grade intracranial vertebrobasilar lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathognomonic Doppler finding was an abrupt deceleration of the blood column during systole and stoppage or even reflux during diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same blood flow alterations were found in two additional illustrative cases having therapeutically or brain-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced blockages of the vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiologic mechanisms of flow disturbances and the limitations of Doppler sonography in this area are discussed </plain></SENT>
