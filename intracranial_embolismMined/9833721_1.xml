<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Comparison of the occurrence, intensity and rate of high-intensity transient signals (HITS), measured in both middle cerebral arteries by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) after mechanical or homograft aortic valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TCD monitoring was performed by means of a pulsed Doppler ultrasound with two 2 MHz probes, stabilized on the head and directed at the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outdoor patients after aortic valve replacement in a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: The study cohort comprised a random transverse sample of patients and included 20 patients with a mechanical aortic valve and 20 with a homograft aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made with 20 admitted control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: No interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: No significant number of HITS were expected in the homograft group and a limited number in the mechanical valve group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HITS were detected in more patients after implantation of a mechanical aortic valve prosthesis compared with a homograft aortic valve (16 versus 8, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, more patients with a homograft aortic valve showed HITS than the control patients (8 versus 1, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean number of HITS in the mechanical prosthesis group was higher than in the homograft group (3, range 0-18 versus 13, range 0-70, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HITS in patients with mechanical prostheses had a higher amplitude than HITS in patients with homograft aortic valves (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Focal neurological deficit (FND) was diagnosed in 9 patients (mechanical prosthesis 6 versus homograft 3, ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HITS commonly occur both in patients with a mechanical aortic valve and in patients with a homograft aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HITS occur significantly less often, at a lower rate and with a lower intensity in patients with homograft aortic valve compared with patients with a mechanical aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future studies should elucidate the nature and prognostic significance of HITS and their relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
