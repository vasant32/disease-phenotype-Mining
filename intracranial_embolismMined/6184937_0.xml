<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty six cases of crossed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> in dextrals are reviewed, and compared with a group of aphasics by left-sided lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis is made attending to the clinical typology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, sex, age, associated higher cortical functions defects and familial left-handedness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crossed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> in dextrals is due to right or bilateral language representation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that anomalous language is accompanied by lesser intrahemispheric specialization of the classic areas of language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dominance of the minor hemisphere for some praxic and visuo-spatial functions is also lessened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Crossed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and familial left handedness would not be associated </plain></SENT>
