<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the antithrombotic effect of anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody Fab fragment YM337 with that of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> ozagrel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the monkeys under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia, the right middle cerebral artery was observed via a transorbital approach without cutting the dura mater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Photoillumination (wavelength 540 nm) was applied to the middle cerebral artery, and then <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> (20 mg kg(-1)) was administered intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental drugs were intravenously injected 15 min before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> injection and followed by continuous infusion for 3 h after dye injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The thrombotic occlusion induced by this photochemical reaction in monkey middle cerebral artery was reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>YM337 significantly prolonged the time to first occlusion and the total time of arterial patency during the 3-h observation period after dye injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> ozagrel had no significant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>YM337 but not <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> ozagrel significantly inhibited ex vivo <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, while <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> ozagrel significantly inhibited the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> generation accompanying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation, YM337 had no effect on this variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit in the YM337-treated animals was significantly milder than that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the YM337 treatment animals was smaller than that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The novel selective GPIIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> YM337 was effective in ameliorating the decrease in patency of the middle cerebral artery and reducing the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in monkeys </plain></SENT>
