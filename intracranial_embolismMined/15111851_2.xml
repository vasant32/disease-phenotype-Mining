<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and demonstrate the advantages of a new technique for carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) with proximal cerebral protection through a direct transcervical approach, as compared with a percutaneous transfemoral approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CAS procedures were carried out in 25 consecutive patients, 4 with the femoral approach and 21 through a 2-cm incision at the base of the neck, with the patient under local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For transcervical occlusion and protective shunting (TOPS), a short 9F sheath was inserted directly into the common carotid artery and connected to a 6F sheath placed percutaneously in the ipsilateral internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After clamping the common carotid artery proximal to the 9F sheath, internal carotid artery blood flow reversal was confirmed or an occluding external carotid balloon was placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A filter interposed between the arterial and venous sheaths collected embolic debris from transcarotid manipulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The arterial puncture was directly repaired with suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurologic status was assessed with the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale by an independent neurology consultant before and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One of the four percutaneous femoral approaches that failed because of tortuous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> was successfully treated with TOPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiographic confirmation demonstrating resolution of asymptomatic (&gt;80%; n = 12) stenosis or symptomatic (&gt;60%; n = 12) stenosis was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 0% technical failure rate and 0% combined 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or mortality rate were achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CAS attempted with TOPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> in the cervical group, despite pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3759">clopidogrel bisulfate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and one <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the femoral group after failure of a Perclose arterial closure device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one of the patients in the femoral group bilateral cholesterol emboli to the toes developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TOPS solves problems of access, embolization into the cerebral and peripheral circulation, and specialized cerebral protection devices, and enables secure closure of the access vessel in patients given anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TOPS may provide a safer, more effective, economical means for performing CAS </plain></SENT>
