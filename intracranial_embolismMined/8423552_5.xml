<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The dose-dependent effects of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) on the kinetics of cerebral clot lysis in a rabbit model of middle cerebral artery embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clots were formed in vitro and tagged with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33371">99Tc</z:chebi> for gamma-scintigraphic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After embolization, groups of animals were treated with t-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dose-response curves for the t-PA were generated, and in addition, long and short dosing schedules were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimal doses for frequency and rate of cerebral clot lysis in this model are approximately 6.3 mg/kg given over 2 hr or 3.3 mg/kg given over 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These dosing regimens for t-PA were accompanied by approximately 50% consumption of plasma plasminogen, fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Doses of t-PA on either side of this optimum caused attenuation in both the frequency and rate of cerebral clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with t-PA under either dosing regimen did not augment the frequency of hemorrhagic transformation, but the size of the resultant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in those animals where <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> occurred was reduced by 3.3 mg/kg t-PA given over 30 min </plain></SENT>
