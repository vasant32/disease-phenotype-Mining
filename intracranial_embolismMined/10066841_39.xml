<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We chose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined intrathrombus rtPA and intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We treated 12 patients with symptoms of 1 to 40 days' duration (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo>, focal deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment MRI disclosed subtle hemorrhagic venous infarction in 4 patients, obvious hemorrhagic infarction in 2, small parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from recent pallidotomy in 1, and no focal lesion in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance venography and contrast venography identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in 3 patients; transverse/sigmoid sinus (TS/SS) in 2; SSS and both TS/SS in 1; SSS and 1 TS/SS in 5; and SSS, 1 TS/SS, and straight sinus in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A loading dose of rtPA was instilled throughout the clot at 1 mg/cm, followed by continuous intrathrombus infusion at 1 to 2 mg/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was infused concomitantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Flow was restored completely in 6 patients and partially in 3, with a mean rtPA dose of 46 mg (range, 23 to 128 mg) at a mean time of 29 hours (range, 13 to 77 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptoms improved in these 9 patients concomitantly with flow restoration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow could not be restored in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 of them, treatment was stopped when little progress had been made, and fibrinogen level dropped to 118 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the other 2 patients, hemorrhagic worsening occurred, and treatment was abbreviated after initial rtPA dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 1 of these, the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was evacuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with intrathrombus rtPA in conjunction with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in patients with CVT is encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This therapy should probably be regarded as unsafe in patients with obvious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Time to restore flow may be faster than with urokinase (an average of 71 hours has been reported for 29 documented patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of rtPA with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in CVT is warranted </plain></SENT>
