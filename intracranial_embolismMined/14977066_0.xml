<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 90 patients, 71 men and 19 women, aged 60 +/- 10 years (mean +/- SD), undergoing elective cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting (one vessel, n = 6; two vessels, n = 24; three vessels, n = 33; four vessels, n = 9) or valve replacement (mitral valve, n = 2, aortic valve, n = 15, both valves, n = 1) were monitored with transcranial Doppler sonography during the complete surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surgical and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> techniques were standardized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, except for the type of membrane oxygenator used (COBE <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> Duo, n = 55 or DIDECO D 703, n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> count was expressed as total number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detected in both middle cerebral arteries during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and also as total <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> number divided by the CPB duration in minutes (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in patients' age or sex and type and duration of operation were noted between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> incidence while the patients were on cardiopulmonary bypass was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts during CPB were 309 (236-502) and 143 (86-233) for DIDECO and COBE oxygenators, respectively (p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> min(-1) were also significantly higher in patients operated with DIDECO, as compared to COBE oxygenators (3.7 (2.4-5.6) versus 1.5 (1-2.4), respectively, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inter-observer variability was satisfactory (k = 0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of a DIDECO D 703 oxygenator resulted in significantly higher <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts as compared to the COBE <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> Duo oxygenator </plain></SENT>
