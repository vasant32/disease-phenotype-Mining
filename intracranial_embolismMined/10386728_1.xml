<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In terms of microembolic signal (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) detection, the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) mainstem has only scarcely been considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vessel itself, however, could be at least partly responsible for the enormous variation when calculating the essential time difference (deltat) values of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> using the dual-gate technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the time characteristics of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in a computer simulation applying an anatomically realistic vessel and a dual-gate TCD approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three different <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomies</z:mp> and two <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> to blood intensities were simulated as well as two different sample volume settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> length (proximal sample volume t1; distal sample volume t2) and deltat were calculated for different angles of insonation and sample volume depths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The calculations of the time characteristics of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> showed extreme variation, with only modest changes of the insonation angle (t1 4-34 ms; deltat 9-27 ms) or the sample volume depth (t1 7-27 ms; deltat 6-32 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variation could be considerably reduced with modified TCD settings i.e., a shorter gate separation combined with a shorter receiver gate time in the distal sample volume (deltat with changing insonation angles 6-19 ms; deltat with changing insonation depths 13-17 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results not only urge us to a cautious interpretation of the properties of single <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, but also contribute to an understanding of the marked deltat variation using the dual-gate technique </plain></SENT>
