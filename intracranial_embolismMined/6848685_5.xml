<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One group of animals served as a control (non-embolectomized group), and in the other two groups the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was removed 3 or 6 hours after occlusion (3-hour or 6-hour embolectomy group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the non-embolectomized animals, major neurological deficits with deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the basal ganglia decreased most prominently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensory evoked potentials also declined to about 50% of the control level 3 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 3-hour embolectomy group, mild neurological deficits with minimal infarctions were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hour after embolectomy, CBF was restored to the original level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions, and the sensory evoked potentials surpassed the control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 6-hour embolectomy group, most animals exhibited major neurological deficits and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> with hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that early microsurgical embolectomy of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk restores blood flow in the perforating arteries and prevents deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
