<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a new endovascular method for the treatment of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This new method consists of combining a metallic stent with a liquid polymer; the stent is first placed across the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to reconstruct a tubular arterial lumen, followed by obliteration of the fundus of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with an ethyl vinyl alcohol polymer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During its injection, the liquid polymer is contained within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by temporarily inflating an occlusion balloon in the parent artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients harboring a giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were successfully treated using this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were excluded from the circulation, with preservation of the parent artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In nine of the 11 patients, the 6-month follow-up angiogram demonstrated no recanalization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient who had a giant and partially clotted internal carotid artery bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, the follow-up angiogram demonstrated minimal recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The complications in this series of patients included one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and one case of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> caused by watershed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The initial anatomical results and the clinical outcome in this small series of patients are very encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mortality and morbidity rates associated with this new endovascular treatment are superior to those associated with surgical clipping of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
