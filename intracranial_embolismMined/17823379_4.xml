<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Targeted ultrasound contrast agents have recently been developed to adhere selectively to specific pathogenic materials such as plaque or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of such microbubbles has potential to aid transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) detection of emboli and to act as markers for distinguishing one embolic material from another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether TCD detection of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> emboli would be enhanced by the addition of targeted microbubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Binding of microbubbles to the surface of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Targeted and control bubbles were then introduced to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and tissue-mimicking material circulated under pulsatile-flow conditions in an in vitro flow rig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embolic signal intensities before and after introduction of the bubbles were measured by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Targeted microbubbles enhanced TCD signal intensities from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> emboli by up to 13 dB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bubbles were capable of binding to moving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> when injected into the flow circuit in low concentrations ( approximately 36 bubbles per 100 mL) and were retained on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> under pulsatile-flow conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Signal intensities from similarly sized pieces of tissue-mimicking material were not enhanced by injection of targeted bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Injection of appropriately targeted microbubbles significantly enhances TCD detection of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> emboli in vitro </plain></SENT>
