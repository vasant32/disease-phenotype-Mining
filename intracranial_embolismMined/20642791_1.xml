<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography is routinely performed in patients with CIE despite guidelines recommending restriction of echocardiography to patients with clinically suspected cardioembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the therapeutic impact and prognostic role of echocardiographic findings in an unselected population suffering from CIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between November 2006 and November 2007, 319 patients with CIE underwent evaluation by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and in addition by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) if deemed mandatory (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combined clinical end-point included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or recurrent CIE, occurring during a follow-up period of 3 and 12 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 3 months of follow-up, the combined end-point was noted in 30 (9%) and after 12 months in 43 (13%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.38-3.25; P &lt; 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD: HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.21-2.81; P = 0.004) were predictors of events occurring during short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 1 year of follow-up, AF (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.19-2.32; P = 0.003) and CAD (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.09-2.06; P = 0.01) were associated with the combined end-point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic parameters assessed at study entry were not independently related to an adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Whereas AF and CAD appear to increase the risk of events after suffering from CIE, echocardiographic findings were not independently associated with the combined end-point of recurrent CIE or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
