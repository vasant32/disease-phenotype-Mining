<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> following angioplasty-stent placement (AGP) is higher than that observed after a carotid endarterectomy (CE) using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, no studies have been conducted to compare the two revascularisation procedures with the latest neuroimaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To analyse the presence and repercussion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DMR) following carotid revascularisation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our prospective study included a sample of 20 consecutive patients with atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> &gt; 70% according to NASCET criteria and treated by CE (n = 10) or AGP (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were submitted to a DMR during the 48 hours prior to revascularisation and another within the 72 hours following the intervention in order to evaluate the existence of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were explored by a neurologist before and after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DMR allowed new areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> to be detected in 10% of the CE and in 40% of the AGP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>50% of the post-AGP ischemic lesions were multiple and 10% of the lesions in each therapeutic group presented some clinical correlation in the form of transient neurological focal signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed with respect to the pattern of risk of complications between the two therapeutic groups and no factors associated to a higher risk of new ischemic lesions were detected by DMR in patients submitted to AGP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid AGP is linked to a higher frequency of new ischemic lesions in the brain than in the case of CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these ischemic lesions detected by DMR are usually silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic complications were similar in the two procedures </plain></SENT>
