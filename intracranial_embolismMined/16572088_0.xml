<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Randomized trials and individual series are looking at predicting factors of early outcome after carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) that can hardly be applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed early results of the Eurocast registry and discussed the potential role of multicentric registries in determining such outcome predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Eurocast registry is an online prospective registry on CAS that collected 897 procedures from February 2000 to December 2005 across 20 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed with the univariate Fisher's exact test on CS procedures, excluding sole balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors reported were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, past or current history of smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e>, hostile neck and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Half of patients (50.2%) had symptomatic carotid lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local anesthesia (91.8%) and retrograde femoral access (95.6%) were the preferred method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall procedures were achieved in 98.2%, of which 84.5% were performed under cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraoperative neurological complications occurred in 26 (3.1%) of 824 procedures achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No immediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intraoperative ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 1.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 3.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors of early neurological complications were infarctions on preoperative cerebral CT scanning, a deficient circle of Willis, a too short preoperative length of medication (7 days or less), any additional intervention (stenting and/or balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Less reliable predictors were: age &gt;70 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, preoperative speech or motor deficit, postradiation stenosis, lesion on the left carotid axis and lesion on the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This analysis confirmed that CS is a feasible and secure technique to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the determination of neurological outcome predictors remains subject to further confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Other patient subgroups identified in other studies (female sex, diabetics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo>) should be investigated more precisely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Finally, the Eurocast analysis showed that the setting up of risk scores would be dependent on local practices, physicians' experience and would not be reproducible </plain></SENT>
