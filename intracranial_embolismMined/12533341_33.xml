<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> has become an accepted alternative to surgery, the main complication continues to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the frequency and radiologic appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> during GDC embolization for asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> by using diffusion-weighted (DW) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and to determine whether aneurysmal anatomic factors or use of the balloon-assisted technique affected the frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 74 patients, 79 asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with GDC embolizations at the National Cardiovascular Center from 1999 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (49%) were treated with the balloon-assisted technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DW imaging was performed in 66 patients at 2-5 days after GDC embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> DW images were reviewed by two radiologists for depiction of abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DW images showed hyperintense lesions in 40 patients (61%), with 16 of these patients (40%) incurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deteriorations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the symptomatic patients (94%) fully recovered by discharge, and the remaining one experienced permanent deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hyperintense lesions were detected more frequently in wide-neck (73%) or large (100%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and in procedures that used the balloon-assisted technique (73%) than in small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (50%) or in procedures with the simple GDC method (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of new lesions was significantly associated with use of the balloon-assisted technique and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> diameter in multivariate analysis (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our experience, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> related to the use of GDC embolization are relatively common, especially in wide-neck or large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or in association with the balloon-assisted technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although permanent deficits are rare, the high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> suggests that improvements in the technique such as the addition of antiplatelet agents and the development of new embolic materials are mandatory </plain></SENT>
