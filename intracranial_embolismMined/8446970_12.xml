<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the young is different from that in older patients and remains unknown in almost one third of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain further insight into both pathogenic and etiologic determinants, we prospectively studied a large number of consecutive young adults with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred thirty-three patients aged 15-44 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within the 8 weeks before hospital admission were recruited and investigated by using a standardized protocol of clinical evaluation, blood tests, electrocardiography, echocardiography, chest roentgenography, and brain computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presumed etiology was diagnosed by prospectively applied criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women predominated (61%) among patients under 35 years of age, mainly due to the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> related to oral contraceptive use, while men outnumbered women (60%) among patients over that age because of a higher prevalence of atherothrombotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> of cardiac origin was the presumed cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 23.7%, but conventional sources of emboli were found only in 7.5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a low prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> among young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was found in 8.4%, as expected, predominantly (71.4%) among the younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> over <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> was proportional to the likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001969" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcohol intoxication</z:e> was considered a precipitating factor in only three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> (0.3%), oral contraceptive use in women (8.1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (1.2%), and other associated medical diseases (1.5%) were lower than reported in recent clinical series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two different groups of pathogenic determinants predominate in younger women and in older men, supporting public health measures aimed at strict medical control of the recognized cerebrovascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
