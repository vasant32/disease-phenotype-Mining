<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been used recently to detect atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> before cardioversion of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been assumed that embolic events after cardioversion result from embolism of preexisting atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> that are accurately detected by TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the clinical and echocardiographic findings in patients with embolism after cardioversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> despite exclusion of atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> by TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical and echocardiographic data in 17 patients with embolic events after TEE-guided electrical (n = 16) or pharmacological (n = 1) cardioversion were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 17 patients had nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, including four patients with lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TEE before cardioversion showed left atrial spontaneous echo contrast in five patients and did not show atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardioversion resulted in return to sinus rhythm without immediate complication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had cerebral embolic events and four patients had peripheral embolism occurring 2 hours to 7 days after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients were therapeutically anticoagulated at the time of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New or increased left atrial spontaneous echo contrast was detected in four of the five patients undergoing repeat TEE after cardioversion including one patient with a new left atrial appendage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Embolism may occur after cardioversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in inadequately anticoagulated patients despite apparent exclusion of preexisting atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> by TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest de novo <z:mp ids='MP_0001855'>atrial thrombosis</z:mp> after cardioversion or imperfect sensitivity of TEE for atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and suggest that screening by TEE does not obviate the requirement for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy at the time of and after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A randomized clinical trial is needed to compare conventional <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> management with a TEE-guided strategy including anticoagulation after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
