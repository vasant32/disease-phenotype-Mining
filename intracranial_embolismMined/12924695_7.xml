<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1997 and 2002, 111 unruptured paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> categorized according to a modified al-Rodhan classification (Group la, 30 anterior wall lesions; Group lb, 25 ventral paraclinoid lesions; Group IL 18 true ophthalmic artery lesions; Group III, 37 carotid cave lesions; and Group IV, one transitional lesion) were treated by direct surgery (35 lesions) and/or endovascular treatment (77 lesions) (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated by both procedures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In lesions in Groups Ia, Ib, II, and III that were treated by endovascular treatment, complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> obliteration was achieved in 50, 65, 50, and 78%, respectively, and the combined transient and permanent morbidity rates due to cerebral embolic events were 20, 25, 20, and 13.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, the transient morbidity rate after endovascular treatment was 14.3% and the permanent morbidity rate was 6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, permanent visual deficits caused by <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism occurred after endovascular treatment in two patients with Group II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct surgery was mainly performed in Groups Ia (20 lesions), Ib (five lesions), and II (eight lesions), with complete neck clip occlusion achieved in 80, 80, and 71.4%, respectively; the transient and permanent morbidity rates associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated by surgery were 8.6 and 2.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular therapy for superiorly projecting paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (Groups Ia and II) is associated with lower rates of complete obliteration than direct surgery, and with rates of cerebral embolic events comparable to those of endovascular treatment in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, endovascular treatment for Group II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> entails additional risks of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, direct surgery is recommended for the treatment of paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> projecting superiorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For other groups, especially for Group III, endovascular treatment is the acceptable first line of therapy </plain></SENT>
