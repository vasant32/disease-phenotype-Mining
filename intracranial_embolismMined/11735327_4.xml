<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> development in the thoracic aorta is miscellaneous and still only partially understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The marked variability of the sites of deposition of atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta could not be clarified based solely on the risk-factors theory of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sites of deposition of atherosclerotic plaques are considered to be affected by blood-flow patterns that cause areas of altered shear stress on the aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Close relations between protruding aortic plaques (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and peripheral emboli were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> distribution and motion to characterize atherogenesis in the human thoracic aorta and the pathogeneses of embolic events was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We concluded that protruding aortic plaques and markers of relative aortic flow instability (occurrences of vortices) are predominantly noticed in the human arch and in the descending aorta, whereas the ascending aorta showed lesser prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reversal and rotational blood-flow in the thoracic aorta most likely exist in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with systemic emboli and mobile protruding aortic atheromas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, retrograde <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> from distal aortic plaques is conceivable </plain></SENT>
