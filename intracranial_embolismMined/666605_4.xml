<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Horizontal smooth pursuit by an adducting eye on the side of a medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) lesion was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in three of four patients; vertical pursuit was abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The horizontal VOR gain of slow components made by an adducting eye on the side of an MLF lesion was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vertical VOR gain was decreased in the two patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that either there are pathways independent of the MLF for horizontal pursuit and vestibular signals that are not available to vertical signals, or vertical pursuit and vestibular eye movements require a higher rate of oculomotor neuron firing than equal-velocity horizontal eye movements </plain></SENT>
