<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Correlation between clinical, CT, and angiographic findings in 24 cases showed that occlusion was most common in the crural segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations and infarction extension varied widely among proximal occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cases with good collateral filling, the infarction was restricted to the thalamus; in those with poor filling, it involved most of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>'s territory, and hemorrhagic transformation occasionally ensued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies between findings were ascribed to dislodging of emboli or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, recanalization, and transient obscuration of the infarction on CT </plain></SENT>
