<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although microbubbles can be detected in the pulmonary artery on decompression using ultrasound, mammalian lungs are competent filters for microbubbles larger than 20 microns in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been assumed that smaller bubbles released by the lungs are harmless, because there is evidence that they do not arrest in the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We injected 15 +/- 5 microns diameter microbubbles in 5 ml of plasma slowly into the right carotid artery of anesthetized guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At intervals of 1, 2, or 3 h postinjection, 2% trypan blue in 2 ml of plasma was injected into the same artery or the contralateral carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control animal for each experiment was injected with 5 ml of plasma only, followed by the injection of dye at the same interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the animals were killed, the brains were examined for evidence of blood-brain barrier dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals at 1 h, and 9 out of 10 animals at 2 h after the injection of microbubbles, showed extravasation of the albumin-binding dye in the ipsilateral hemisphere, indicating gross blood-brain barrier dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In each of the matched controls, the barrier in the neocortex remained intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At Hour 3 the barrier was impermeable to the trypan blue in both experimental and control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These experiments demonstrate that microbubbles impair the blood-brain barrier integrity to protein, causing focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
