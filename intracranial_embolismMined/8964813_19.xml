<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The symptoms following sinus and vein occlusion observed in patients and experimental animals display a considerable variability that so far remains largely unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a rat cortical vein occlusion model using a photochemical thrombotic technique, we examined changes in the cerebral venous flow pattern by fluorescence angiography and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebral blood volume fraction (CBVF) by a modern laser Doppler "scanning" technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain damage was assessed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence angiographic findings fell into two groups: group A, rats with an altered venous flow pattern after occlusion (n = 12), and group B, rats with interruption of blood flow and/or a growing venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, sham-operated animals made up group C (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extravasation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>, a massive decrease in rCBF, a short-lasting increase in CBVF, and regional brain damage were typical for group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, cortical CBF mapping revealed a transient hyperperfusion zone with hyperemia surrounding a hypoperfused ischemic core in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A circulation perturbation following venous occlusion appeared near those occluded cerebral veins without sufficient collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> continued to grow, accompanied by local critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and severe brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, 71% of the animals (12 of 17) tolerated occlusion of a solitary vein without major flow disturbances or histological evidence of damage to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> (group A) </plain></SENT>
