<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent natural history studies have suggested that unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> smaller than 1 cm have a low risk of rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may be underrepresented in natural history studies because they are preferentially treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors compared the number of patients with symptoms caused by unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> smaller than 1 cm treated surgically at their institution with similar patients enrolled in the International Study of Unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>Intracranial Aneurysms</z:hpo> (ISUIA) from their institution over the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated surgically at the Mayo Clinic from 1980 through 1991 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 97 patients with 117 unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> smaller than 1 cm by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> with a history of rupture or larger than 1 cm on cross-sectional imaging were excluded from analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence and characteristics of symptoms directly attributable to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made with patients from the Mayo Clinic enrolled in the ISUIA retrospective natural history cohort over the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 97 patients studied, 15 presented with symptoms other than rupture (15.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The symptoms were third nerve deficit (seven patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> owing to emboli originating from within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (five patients), and visual acuity loss (three patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had possibly but not definitively caused symptoms; these were considered asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient from the Mayo Clinic enrolled in the retrospective cohort of the ISUIA had a symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> smaller than 1 cm on both angiography and cross-sectional imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> smaller than 1 cm occasionally present with neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These symptoms are typically owing to mass effect on the second and third cranial nerves or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> as a result of emboli originating from within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> less than 1 cm at the Mayo Clinic were preferentially treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although existing natural history data may be applied to most unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, small symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may be underrepresented in natural history studies </plain></SENT>
