<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These controversies may be due to inaccurate classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and differences in age ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between apoE genotypes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes (confirmed by CT or MRI findings) by case-control study in a Japanese rural population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First-ever-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (n=322; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, n=201, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, n=84, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, n=37) aged 40 to 89 years were recruited from Hokuetsu Hospital, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Healthy controls (n=1126) were selected from the general population in the same area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ApoE genotypes were determined by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with apoE epsilon3/epsilon3 subjects, epsilon2 carriers had a 2-fold risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> patients, epsilon2 carriers had increased risks of cortical infarction (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.6) (an anatomic subtype) and atherothrombosis (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.7 to 9.0) and cardioembolism (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 14.4) but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (clinical subtypes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ApoE epsilon4 carriers had a 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5-fold risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ApoE epsilon2/epsilon2 subjects had an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.0 to 19.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ApoE epsilon3/epsilon4 subjects showed approximately 2-fold increased risk of atherothrombosis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.1) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The association between epsilon2 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was accentuated in subjects aged 70 years or older but not in those aged 40 to 69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that apoE epsilon2 is a risk factor for atherothrombosis, cardioembolism, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, whereas epsilon4 is a risk factor for atherothrombosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be affected by interaction between age and apoE gene polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
