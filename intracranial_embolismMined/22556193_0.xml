<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> load (300 mg) combined with dual antiplatelet therapy has been shown to reduce <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in patients with symptomatic CARAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine feasibility of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> load in decreasing asymptomatic embolization in patients with symptomatic CARAS undergoing urgent carotid endarterectomy within the first 2 weeks from the index event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects and METHODS: Consecutive patients with symptomatic CARAS (70%-99%) and presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> on 1-hour baseline (&lt;24 hours from the index event) transcranial Doppler monitoring of ipsilateral middle cerebral artery were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> load followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (75 mg)±aspirin (100 mg) during the elapsed time period between hospital admission and urgent carotid endarterectomy at 3 tertiary-care <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeat 1-hour transcranial Doppler monitoring was performed the day before surgery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 11 symptomatic CARAS patients (mean age, 66±7 years; 73% men; 64% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>) were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> load followed by dual (67%) or single (33%) antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> count was significantly reduced between baseline (median count, 8 MES/h; interquartile range, 6-19) and repeat transcranial Doppler monitoring (0 MES/h; interquartile range, 0-3; P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot observational study provides preliminary nonrandomized data regarding the potential efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> load to reduce asymptomatic embolization in patients with symptomatic CARAS before urgent carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
