<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the previous report the theoretical background and technical details of the isocount scanning were described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on clinical experiences of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e>, the newly developed scanning method was confirmed to be more useful than the conventional scintiscanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides the new scanning method, a new display system was also developed for the sake of more precise analysis of the isocount scanned data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This display method is called multilevel analysis or multilevel slicing of the scanned data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, this method was applied to thirty-two cases of cerebrovascular diseases, including seven cases of cerebral arterio-venous malformation, four cases of hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and twenty-one cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, positive rates being 86%, 100% and 90% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In case of arterio-venous malformation, minimum size detected by the isocount method was 2 cm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To twenty one cases of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, total thirty two scanning examinations were performed, including postictal follow up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is often said that it is two or three weeks after the ictus when the infarcted cerebral lesion is most clearly detectable by the scintigraphic procedures, presumably due to focal neovascularizations which may occur in the lesion most prominently at this postictal stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contradicted to the current concept, our experiences show that abnormal dot accumulations are recognized in the scintigrams even at the earlier stage, thus among five cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> scanned within a week after the ictus positive figures were obtained in four cases, two of which were examined within two days after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Focal breakdown of blood brain barrier at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage is considered to be responsible for the early positivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In eight cases among twenty one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> angiographies failed to demonstrate the vessel occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The isocount scanning method, however, succeeded in getting positive results in seven of the eight cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It will be emphasized that the isocount scanning is a preferable diagnostic procedure in the cerebrovascular diseases, especially when the angiography is hesitated to be performed because of the patient severely affected </plain></SENT>
