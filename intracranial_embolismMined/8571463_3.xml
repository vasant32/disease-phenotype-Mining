<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients with different kinds of prosthetic valves underwent bilateral transcranial Doppler monitoring for 1 h to detect high intensity Doppler signals representing microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparing the total number of embolic signals in both middle cerebral arteries (N = 1066), a side preference was not statistically evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, clear side preferences were obvious in some individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lack of statistical evidence for hemispherical preferences of cardiac microembolism in general does not exclude selective streaming in individuals, explaining the clinical observation of lodging preferences of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cardiac source of microembolism may mimic disease activity of extracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and bias the localization of embolic source </plain></SENT>
