<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The advent of noninvasive high-resolution brain and cerebrovascular imaging by magnetic resonance, computed tomography, and pulsed Doppler ultrasonography now permits in vivo assessment of pathophysiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuroradiographic and carotid duplex studies were performed in patients who developed neurological deficits following cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 30 symptomatic patients undergoing magnetic resonance or computed tomography brain scans, 18 (60%) had findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Embolic infarction</z:e> was evident in 14 (78%) of these 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Watershed injury was the predominant finding in a single patient, while findings consistent with global <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> were present in another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid atheroemboli were excluded as a possible source of embolism in 11 patients whose carotid duplex studies were unremarkable preoperatively as well as in 3 further patients whose neuroradiographic findings did not correspond with their moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that infarction due to noncarotid embolism is the primary pathophysiology of neurological deterioration following cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
