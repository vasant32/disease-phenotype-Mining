<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report covers a series of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cervical carotid occlusion and profound neurological deficits who were treated with intracranial intraarterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients presented with arm plegia with variable leg involvement and two of them had global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography identified occlusion of the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) in each case and intracranial thromboembolus of the supraclinoid ICA and/or its branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Catheter navigation through the occluded ICA segment was straightforward in three patients and somewhat difficult in one patient with an 80% ICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraarterial urokinase infusion along with mechanical clot disruption was performed at the clot site in the middle cerebral artery, supraclinoid ICA, and/or anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had recanalization of the treated artery after urokinase infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antegrade flow through the ICA was reestablished in two patients, and good collateral filling across the anterior communicating artery was established in the other two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had major pretreatment deficits (mean National Institutes of Health (NIH) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Score 24 +/-4) with significant improvement noted at 3 months posttreatment (NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Score 7 +/-6;p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients made a dramatic early recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postprocedure computerized tomography revealed no abnormality in one and asymptomatic basal ganglia high density from repeated local contrast injections in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the basis of their findings in this small study group the authors suggest that catheter navigation through a presumably occluded carotid artery is feasible and possibly effective in thrombolytic therapy of intracranial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further study with clinical trials is necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of this technique </plain></SENT>
