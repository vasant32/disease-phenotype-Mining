<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) can be identified by transesophageal echocardiography and transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) with contrast agents and a Valsalva maneuver (VM) as a provocation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article applies the modalities of these tests detailed in previous studies to a large patient cohort and compares 2 contrast agents (saline and Echovist-300) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-one patients were investigated by both transesophageal echocardiography and bilateral TCD of the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following protocol with injections of 10 mL agitated saline was applied in a randomized way: (1) no VM, (2) VM for 5 seconds starting 5 seconds after the beginning of contrast injection, and (3) repetition of the test with VM if the first test with VM was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The VM was performed for 5 seconds starting exactly 5 seconds after the beginning of saline injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the same protocol was repeated with 10 mL Echovist-300 instead of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one patients had a cardiac RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Echovist-300 investigation disclosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these 31 shunts, but saline disclosed only 29 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two had an RLS only in at least 1 of the above TCD tests, some of them even with a considerable shunt volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contrast TCD performed with Echovist-300 but not with saline yields a 100% sensitivity to identify transesophageal echocardiography-proven cardiac RLSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The TCD test should be repeated if negative the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This article gives detailed information for the optimization of the contrast TCD technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Extracardiac shunts detected only during contrast TCD can have a considerable shunt volume and may allow for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
