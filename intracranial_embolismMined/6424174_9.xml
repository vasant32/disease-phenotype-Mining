<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both early physiologic studies and recent clinical reports suggest that arterial <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>-DSA is a safe and useful diagnostic tool in the examination of extremity circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the neurologic sequelae, pathologic changes, and effects on the blood-brain barrier to intravenous Evans-Blue and horseradish peroxidase of intracarotid <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>, in <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As with other forms of cerebral gas embolization, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> produced multifocal ischemic infarctions and disrupted the blood-brain barrier to macromolecular tracers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The site of the barrier lesion is the endothelial cell membrane, although the precise mechanisms of damage remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Caution must be urged in the use of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>-DSA to avoid embolization of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
