<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A perspex model of a dog aortic trifurcation was machined to scale and perfused with steady flow from a constant pressure reservoir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The tail artery was plugged to produce a flow model of an intracranial saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> flow rates, no flow occurred beyond 2.5 tube diameters of the tail artery down-stream from the mouth of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was assumed to explain why large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> thrombose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements of velocity fluctuations were made with a hot film anemometer and recorded on tape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequency analysis showed that the peak frequency was a function of flow rate, and suggested that eddies were shed from the origin of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was presumed to be an artifact due to sharp entrance produced by machining the perspex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total energy at any one point in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was independent of the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> but increased with flow rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximum fluctuations were comparable in the center and in the sides of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, but were less on the top and bottom of it (assuming the central plane was in the plane of the trifurcation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference presumably would be less if the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were spherical rather than cylindrical </plain></SENT>
