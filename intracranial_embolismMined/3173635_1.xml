<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are also fatal cases among which severe ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There haven's been many cases reported of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> embolectomy in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, and findings concerning them have been very complicated and hard to analyze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless there certainly exist cases where remarkable improvement of neurological signs is shown soon after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five cases of emergency embolectomy have been undergone in our hospital in the past 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were better than results obtained in cases where embolectomy was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three male and two female cases are the objectives, whose average age was 61 +/- 6 years (ranging from 54 to 67 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The left side of the MC was involved in three cases and the right in two, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases had past history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> which may have been the embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each case had undergone CT scan soon after admission to make sure not to be the other type of intracranial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed next, to discover the site of the occlusion and the degree of collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Emergency embolectomy was performed as soon as possible in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome was estimated from the ADL three months later using the international fifth degree grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results: The period from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to recanalization ranges between 4.5 to 11 hours (average 6.9 +/- 2.5 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Good MC recanalization was demonstrated in each case angiographically within a week after the operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
