<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>For several years now, a controversy has developed on how to position a patient after a decompression accident with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of the so-called Trendelenburg position, based on experimental evidence gathered on dogs, has recently been challenged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The basis assumption was that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> may be reduced by the hydrostatic effect of putting the head below the body's center of gravity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This position however required much technical resourcefulness and often delayed the first therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Newer experimental research shows that, contrary to the old theory, positioning the head below feet level increases the intra-cranial pressure, injuring the blood-brain barrier, even when done under hyperbaric oxygen therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A wide consensus has now emerged, which should be communicated to first-aid personnel, so that no more time is being lost in trying to position the accidented diver by unduly complicated means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current recommendations asks for laying the injured diver horizontally on its back, or sideways, if he is unconscious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is by far more important to control its vital functions, give first-aid, administer oxygen in closed circuit, and shorten as much as possible transport time to the next center for hyperbaric therapy </plain></SENT>
