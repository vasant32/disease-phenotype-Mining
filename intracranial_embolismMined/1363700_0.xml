<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The result showed that the yield stress (tau 0), non-Newtonian contribution of viscosity (eta s-mu) and viscosity of plasma (eta p) were significantly higher than those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those patients were randomly divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each group included 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients in group 1 and group 2 were treated with poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23008">saccharide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi>) and DX40 respectively by intravenous drip for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that tau 0, A, (eta s-mu) were significant decreased in group 1 after treatment, but no significantly change in the thixotropic parameters was found in group 2 after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total curative rate in group 1 was higher than that in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> had evidently increased degree of RBC aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> could decrease the aggregation of RBC more significantly than DX40 did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was probably one of the reasons why the therapeutic effect of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> was better than that of DX40 </plain></SENT>
