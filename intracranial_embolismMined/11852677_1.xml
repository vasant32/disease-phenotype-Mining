<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies in the United Kingdom and in the USA showed that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> tissue could contaminate the lungs after using pneumatic powered air injection stunners (e.g. "The Knocker") or after pithing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, pithing was forbidden in the European Union since January 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In German abattoirs conventional cartridge-fired stunners (e.g. model by Schermer) are usually applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pithing was used up to December 2000 in approx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>75% of the German abattoirs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study 323 lungs of cattle were analysed for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lungs were derived from cattle exclusive stunned by use of the knocker from Schermer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>60% of the lungs contained emboli which were tested with immuno chemistry as well as immuno histochemistry to detect <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of 108 pooled samples showed a faint immuno reaction in the anti-NSE and anti-GFAP immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further two particles showed a faint reaction for NSE and GFAP in immuno histochemistry, thus suggesting the presence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even though <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> tissue could not be shown in the histological investigation, we used our findings to estimate the worst case scenario for human BSE exposure risk (HER) by lung contaminated by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The content of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> in the samples was estimated to be about 0.11% when the respective immuno reactions were calibrated against standards containing known brain concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Under the assumption that only one lung in the pooled samples was contaminated with BSE-infected central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tissue, the HER was calculated to reach a maximum of 2.2 x 10(-5) CoID50/consumer after consumption of a sausage with a portion of 10% lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results of our study suggest that the contamination of the lung with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> after using a conventional cartridge-fired stunner cannot be excluded, however, the incidence appears to be very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, presumed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> emboli, if at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, are microscopically small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the incidence of BSE in Germany is very low and lungs of cattle are usually not consumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus we can judge the potential for human oral exposure after consumption of lungs of cattle which were stunned in Germany to be extremely low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A final assessment, however, is impossible as there is no knowledge about the minimum infectious dose for humans </plain></SENT>
