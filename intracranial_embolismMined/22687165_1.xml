<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The TOAST classification divides patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> into five subgroups according to the presumed etiological mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study were to evaluate the distribution of the different etiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes in a hospital-based sample of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, and to investigate the association between important risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 210 patients with a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> admitted to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit of Asker and BÃ¦rum Hospital in Norway between February 2007 and July 2008 were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on vascular risk factors was collected at admittance, examination of neurological deficits was carried out during their stay, and classification was made according to the TOAST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the TOAST classification, 24 (11.4%) of the patients suffered from large vessel disease, 66 (31.4%) from cardioembolic disease, 66 (31.4%) from small vessel disease and 54 (25.7%) from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> varied significantly between the different subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> [odds ratio (OR) 2.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-4.60] and current smoking (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.04-4.08) were the only variables that were related to small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small vessel disease was observed more frequently and large vessel disease less frequently than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small vessel disease was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and current smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study supports the view that the etiology of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> is multifactorial </plain></SENT>
