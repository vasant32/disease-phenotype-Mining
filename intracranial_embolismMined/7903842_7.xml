<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients undergoing carotid angiography were prospectively evaluated by using continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Realtime visual and auditory confirmations of emboli were accomplished by recognizing their specific spectral signature and harmonic quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific phases of the examination, such as manipulation of the catheter and guidewire, flushing of the catheter, and injecting contrast material were documented and correlated with embolic occurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1100 embolic phenomena were detected in the middle cerebral artery during carotid angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 944 occurred during catheter flushing and injection of contrast material, and 156 occurred during catheter and wire manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In each patient, more emboli occurred during catheter flushing and injection of contrast material than during manipulation of the catheter and guidewire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No gross neurologic sequelae occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Embolic phenomena occur frequently during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phases of uncomplicated cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
