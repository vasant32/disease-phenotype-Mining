<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in the general population has not been adequately determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the frequency in patients with cerebral ischemic events, compared with the frequency in the general population, is poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the frequency of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in the general population and to compare the frequency of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in patients with cerebral ischemic events with the frequency in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The frequency of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in the population was determined in 363 subjects, a sample of the participants in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Prevention: Assessment of Risk in a Community study (control subjects), and was compared with the frequency in 355 age- and sex-matched patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography in search of a cardiac source of embolism after a focal cerebral ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was 7.9% in patients versus 2.2% in control subjects (P=0.002; odds ratio of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, 3.65; 95% CI, 1.64 to 8.13, in patients versus control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>Patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) was detected with contrast injections in 56% of subjects with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> predicted the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> (odds ratio of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, 4.57; 95% CI, 2.18 to 9.57, in subjects with versus those without <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 86% of subjects with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, transesophageal echocardiography did not detect an alternative source of cardioembolism other than an associated <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> based on this population-based study is 2.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> is relatively higher in patients evaluated with transesophageal echocardiography after a cerebral ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> is frequently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> as a mechanism of cardioembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (with or without <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) commonly is the only potential cardioembolic source detected with transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
