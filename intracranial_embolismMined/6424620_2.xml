<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 52 year old woman in whom this condition was diagnosed after an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>M mode recordings showed a linear echo in the left atrial cavity in early and mid systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was directly visualised by 2D echo as a hemispherical bulge in the mid portion of the interatrial septum, which was mobile and had a to-and-fro motion between the two atria in relation to the different phases of the cardiac cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by angiography, and at surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A feature of this case was the close correlation between echocardiographic, angiographic and operative findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> remains conjectural as does its role in the production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, the evidence for which was circumstantial in the absence of other demonstrable causes and in the light of previously reported cases </plain></SENT>
