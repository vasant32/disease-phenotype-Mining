<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A well-demarcated lesion of the posterior insula (homologous to parieto-insular vestibular cortex in monkeys) was probably the cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is supported by a contraversive tilt of perceived vertical and by involvement of the adjacent auditory (Heschl's) cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dipole source analysis of late auditory evoked potentials revealed a decreased amplitude of a dipole source in the right insular cortex, whereas two other dipoles situated in the temporal lobe showed symmetric activity </plain></SENT>
