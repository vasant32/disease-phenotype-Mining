<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each patient's available plasminogen activity (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>), a measure of plasma fibrinolytic activity, was determined by fluorometric assay before and during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five categories of potential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> complications were identified: rebleeding, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and miscellaneous (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time prolongation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> of the 37 patients with complications was significantly higher than that of the 15 without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients suffered rebleeding episodes and had significantly higher <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> levels during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> therapy when compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients, i.e., those with and without other complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with vasospasm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and thrombotic complications also had significantly higher <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> levels during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> therapy compared to patients without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter may be simply a reflection of the activation of fibrinolytic activity that occurs after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is apparent from these studies that, after the initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> treatment, a maximal steady state inhibition of fibrinolytic activity is not achieved for 2 days and, after the cessation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> therapy, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibrinolytic activity is not restored for a period of 3 to 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with thrombotic events may show persistently low serum plasminogen activity after discontinuance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> therapy, probably due to continuing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and consumption of plasminogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that patients with recurrent preoperative aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> while on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">EACA</z:chebi> therapy may have inadequate fibrinolytic inactivation, and this may be an important factor contributing to rebleeding episodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
