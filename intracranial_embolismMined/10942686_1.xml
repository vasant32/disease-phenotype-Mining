<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: prospective, non-randomised transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring study of 61 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: eversion CEA was performed in 27 and standard CEA in 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed under general anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three (5%) patients had a shunt inserted based on continuous EEG monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous middle cerebral artery TCD monitoring (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e>, TC-4040) was performed intraoperatively and for 45 min postoperatively on day 1, day 2-3, day 4-5 and after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unidirectional signals lasting &gt;25 ms, having intensities of &gt;9 dB were considered to represent embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: intraoperative embolic events were detected in 50 (93%) of 54 patients in whom successful intraoperative TCD monitoring was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Events occurred most frequently immediately following clamp release (85%), without difference between the two techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Embolic events were encountered postoperatively in four (15%) and 16 (48%) patients having eversion and standard CEA, respectively (p&lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed new neurological symptoms equally distributed between eversion and standard CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two (3%) deficits were permanent and two transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patency of the carotid bifurcation was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances with duplex scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: we identified a surprisingly high number of postoperative embolic events as detected with transcranial Doppler in patients who had undergone carotid surgery using standard endarterectomy, as compared to patients who underwent eversion endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Whether this difference has any clinical implication has yet to be proved </plain></SENT>
