<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with a transient focal neurological deficit, critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and/or microemboli detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) have a significant risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi>, a selective <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa inhibitor, was assessed in patients with microembolic signals on TCD after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> or carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with microemboli on TCD (13 symptomatic preoperative, 19 postoperative, one both) were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> between 2002 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> greater than 70 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring was used during and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median (range) rate of microemboli decreased from 22 (4-260) per h before surgery and 81 (44-216) per h after surgery to 0 (0-9) per h in both groups (P &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This occurred rapidly (preoperative median 30 min; postoperative median 45 min) and was well tolerated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with no serious adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral microemboli were controlled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> both before and after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further study is required to compare the relative efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
