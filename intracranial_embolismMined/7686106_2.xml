<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, the intermediates in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> cycle were determined using cerebral cortex isolated from microsphere-injected rats with and without naftidrofuryl oxalate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven-hundred microspheres, with a diameter of 48 microns were injected into the right hemisphere through the right common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on the 3rd day after the operation was confirmed by the development of triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-unstained areas in brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Succinate, fumarate, malate, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16810">alpha-ketoglutarate</z:chebi>, but not oxaloacetate, contents were significantly decreased in the right hemisphere of rats on the 3rd day following microsphere embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the left hemisphere, a similar but smaller decrease in these intermediates was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rats, which showed typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like symptoms, were treated with 15 mg/kg naftidrofuryl oxalate i.p., twice daily for 2.5 days, resulting in a significant reversal of the intermediate content of both hemispheres toward the control and an increased in the triphenyltetrazolium-stained area of a coronal section of the right hemisphere relative to the untreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that naftidrofuryl oxalate attenuates the development of microsphere embolism-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and improves microsphere-induced impairment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed effects provided evidence for a possible site of action of the agent on ischemic brain energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
