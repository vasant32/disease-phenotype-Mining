<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Summary: The physical properties of the 16 microcatheters and 7 guidewires currently available were evaluated to assess their manoeuvrability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This investigation included the latest varieties of these products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The test results showed that there was a wide variation in flexibility and friction between the distal segments of the catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Even the recently developed hydrophilic polymer-coated catheters show this variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between guidewires also showed differing degrees of flexibility and friction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Torque transmission was also a variable factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A combination of the most flexible microcatheter with the lowest friction and the most responsive guidewire with the lowest friction was picked for clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness and safety of this combination of equipment was proved by embolising various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002408'>cerebral arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>( <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) and thrombolysing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> of arteriosclerotic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However it remains difficult to reach the nidus of distally located <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> with extremely long and tortuous feeding pedicles such as parietal lobe <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The efforts to overcome the weaknesses of current materials by further improving equipment and technique is another subject of the current paper </plain></SENT>
