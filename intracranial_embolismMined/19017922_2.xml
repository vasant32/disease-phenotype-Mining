<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate the outcome of carotid artery stent placement (CAS) without the use of embolic protection devices (EPDs) in a large cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preprocedure color Doppler ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging, or computed tomography (CT) were used to evaluate stenosis severity (70% or greater) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings and combined 30-day complication rates in 400 patients (289 men, 111 women; mean age, 73 years +/- 8 [standard deviation]) who underwent unprotected CAS for asymptomatic (n = 156; 39%) or symptomatic (n = 244, 61%) stenoses were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up at 30 days included neurologic evaluation and color Doppler US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Self-expanding stents were successfully deployed in 397 of 400 (99.25%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 397 patients, nine (2.27%) major complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in patients with prior symptoms) had occurred at 30 days, including three (0.76%) major (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in patients who had stopped antiplatelet prophylaxis) and six (1.5%) minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>--three intraprocedural and three delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minor complications included 16 (4%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, four in asymptomatic and 12 in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day combined adverse outcomes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) were significantly correlated with prior presence of symptoms (symptomatic, 8.6%; asymptomatic, 2.6%; P &lt; .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stent placement without EPD was performed with a high technical success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For asymptomatic patients, the combined 30-day adverse-outcomes rate was within the limits recommended by the American Heart Association for carotid endarterectomy and compared favorably with results reported for CAS with EPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> is excluded, the 30-day combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate among patients with prior symptoms also compared favorably with published results </plain></SENT>
