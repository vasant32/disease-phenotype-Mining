<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During a period from January, 1990, to June, 1995, 379 patients were treated with CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative echogram was used in 127 cases (group I) and 252 cases unused (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sites of the aorta for evaluation were following: site of cannulation, aortic clamping, and proximal anastomosis respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depending on the echographical findings the operative procedures were changed as required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in group I was 0.8% (one patient) and in group II, 2.4% (6 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although no significant difference was found in the cohort, rate of incidence in the group II was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 4 cases who had significant atheromatous lesions clearly evaluated by echogram, which were not detected by palpation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the intraoperative assessment of the ascending aorta by echogram is beneficial in prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
