<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The memory and learning deficits induced by injection of carbon-microspheres into the internal carotid artery were significantly improved by T-588 at oral dose of 3-10 mg/kg, as determined by an active avoidance response assay, whereas the reference drugs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi>, idebenone and indeloxazine) proved almost inactive in the same assay procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As far as the embolization was concerned, a significant decrease in cerebral <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> caused by an electrolytic lesion of the BF was assessed by a passive avoidance task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T-588 exhibited a bell-shaped dose-response curve and was most active at 1 mg/kg (oral dose), while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> showed equal activity at 10 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
