<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats received 900 microspheres (48 microns in diameter) via the right internal carotid artery, followed by ligation of the right common carotid artery; and histological and biochemical alterations were examined on the 3rd, 5th, and 28th days after embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The embolism induced increases in triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>- (TTC)-unstained areas and decreases in <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) contents in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of the right hemisphere, suggesting that microsphere embolism causes severe damage to these brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining of the right cortical sections after embolism showed degeneration and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of nerve cells with chromatolytic nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> of the left hemisphere were relatively small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with naftidrofuryl of the embolized rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like symptoms took place from postoperative day 1 to 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment resulted in a reduction in TTC-unstained areas, less morphological damage to cerebral cortex on the 3rd and 5th days, and an appreciable restoration of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> content of three brain regions of the right hemisphere throughout the experiment, but restoration of neurotransmitter amino acids was observed to a smaller degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that naftidrofuryl is capable of preventing the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced, sustained damage to brain regions vulnerable to oxygen deficiency, particularly by improving impaired <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
