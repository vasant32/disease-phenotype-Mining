<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Systemic thrombolysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been established recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas the delay to and the rate of vessel recanalization are unknown, they are likely slower and smaller than for local application of rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to the small benefits of recovery reported and stimulate further investigations to improve clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pilot studies indicate that continuous-wave low-frequency ultrasound (US) can accelerate rt-PA-mediated recanalization of peripheral thrombotic vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the hypothesized therapeutical purpose in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment, we measured the attenuation of ultrasound through the skull at different frequencies and intensities (33.3 and 71.4 kHz; 0.5 and 3.4 W/cm2), and investigated thrombolysis in vitro (n = 125 clots) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Attenuation was lowest by transtemporal insonation of 33.3 kHz, 0.1 dB (0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis (artificial fibrin-rich clots) was significantly increased after 1 h (p &lt; 0.025) and after 3 h (p &lt; 0.01) for US treatment in combination with rt-PA vs. rt-PA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that US increases rt-PA-mediated thrombolysis through the skull and may improve benefits of thrombolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment in vivo </plain></SENT>
