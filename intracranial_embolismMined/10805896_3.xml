<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cerebral arteriogram confirmed a greater than 90% left internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, but with the unexpected finding of a moderate amount of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the proximal ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He underwent emergent left carotid endarterectomy, but during the operation, only a small amount of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was identified as adherent to the atherosclerotic plaque. he awakened in the operating room with a dense right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediate reexploration demonstrated a patent endarterectomy site, a distal thromboembolectomy was performed without extraction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, and urokinase (250,000 Units) was infused into the distal ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He reawakened with an unchanged right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient then underwent an urgent postoperative carotid and cerebral arteriogram that demonstrated an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> to the middle cerebral artery. he was treated with the superselective infusion of urokinase (500,000 Units), with almost complete resolution of the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over the course of the next 48 hours, the patient made a nearly complete neurologic recovery, and he was discharged from the hospital with only a slight facial droop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 2 months' follow-up he was completely neurologically healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the first reported case of urokinase administered in the immediate postoperative period in the angiography suite to treat a thromboembolus complicating a carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
