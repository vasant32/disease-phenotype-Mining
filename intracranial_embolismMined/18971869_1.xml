<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> constitutes a major problem in intensive care units and treatment methods are highly controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> has been thought to result from the migration of bone marrow fragments to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the present authors observed that cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> is not possible unless the bone marrow particles cause alveolar wall destruction due to pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thoracic duct ligation is essential for improved patient survival under such conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate whether thoracic duct ligation plays a preventive role in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> in lung injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: Pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> was established with chest wall trauma in 20 male hybrid rabbits (n=20), with thoracic duct ligation being administered to half (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten days after the procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the rabbits were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain specimens were taken using the frozen-section method, stained with Sudan Black, and examined microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the frozen brain sections the number of branches occluded by fat particles in both the central cerebral arteries was 15.5+/-3.02 in eight animals of the non-ligated group (GI) compared with 4.7+/-2.45 in two animals of the ligated group (GII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of occluded branches of the middle cerebral arteries was significantly higher in GI than in GII (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of branches of both central cerebral arteries occluded by <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> particles was greater in the non-ligated than in the ligated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is believed that thoracic duct ligation provides significant protection against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> in cases of thoracic trauma </plain></SENT>
