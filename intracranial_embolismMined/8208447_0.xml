<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, an increasing role of TEE may be foreseen in this arena, also due to some of the known odds of ultrasound techniques compared to other imaging tools like CT scan or MRI (lower cost and beside availability) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present paper is to briefly review the main indications for TEE in ICU, and to report on some illustrative cases from our experience of I year in this field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight seriously-ill patients referred to our ICU between December 1991 and December 1992 were investigated for 1 of the following diagnostic problems: a) chest trauma with suspicion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and/or mediastinal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>; b) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> of undetermined origin; c) cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; d) assessment of cardiac function in potential heart donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TEE was performed by means of commercially available instruments (either Hp Sonos 1500 or Esaote Sim 7000 Color Flow Mapping), with conventional monoplane probe or so-called wide-angle, "panoramic" probe, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In most of the patients studied, TEE provided either unique or complementary, diagnostically useful, information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By panoramic approach, which yields imaging field up to 270 degrees, a comprehensive visualization of the heart, aorta and mediastinal structures was possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
