<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that combination treatment of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with rtPA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> improves the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats subjected to embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (MCAo) were randomized into control (n = 10) and treatment (n = 9) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four hours after MCAo, a combination of rtPA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (treatment) or saline (control) was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI measurements were performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals at 2 h, 24 h and 48 h after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patency of cerebral microvessels was examined using fluorescent microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI images showed complete blockage of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and a reduction of CBF in the territory supplied by the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> 2 h after MCAo for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, MRI showed that the decreased lesion size, elevated CBF and increased incidence of recanalization were found in treated rats compared with the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination treatment significantly increased microvascular patency (16.3 +/- 5.5% vs. 12.4 +/- 3.5%, of field-of-view) and reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (23.1 +/- 9.6% vs. 38.8 +/- 13.3%, of hemisphere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that the co-administration of rtPA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 4 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is efficacious and is reflected by the MRI indices of recanalization of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, reduction of secondary microvascular perfusion deficits and reduction of the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
