<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of a previous study of the use of oral contraceptives by married women discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> in the years 1964-6 were reported by us last year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present paper adds results relating to patients discharged during 1967 and a few data, that could not be sought previously, for patients discharged with cerebral or coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from three of the hospitals in the earlier period.Of 84 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> 42 (50%) had used oral contraceptives during the month preceding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of their illness, while only 23 of the 168 controls (14%) had done so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No differences in risk were found either for the types of preparation or for the duration of use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After allowance for age and height, the patients with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were about 10 lb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(4,535 g.) heavier than the control patients, irrespective of whether they were using oral contraceptives or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No appreciable difference was found between the smoking habits of patients with and without venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> treated during 1967, nor between women who were using oral contraceptives and those who were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trend in hospital admissions for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> with time corresponded to the trend in the use of oral contraceptives, and there was no evidence to suggest that the number of admissions was affected by publicity about the risk of using the preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> 11 (58%) had been using oral contraceptives, compared with an expected figure of 3.5 from the experience of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the published data (clinical, angiographic, and post-mortem) show that the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> affects the cerebral arteries rather than the cerebral veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 17 patients with coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> 2 (12%) had been using oral contraceptives, compared with an expected figure of 2.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients with coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> smoked more than the control patients and were, on average, 8.3 lb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(3,765 g.) heavier than control women of the same age and height.The new evidence strengthens the belief that oral contraceptives are a cause of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> but does not indicate that they are a cause of coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
