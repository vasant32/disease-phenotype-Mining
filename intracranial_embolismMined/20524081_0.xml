<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> is a well-described complication associated with long-bone fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, with contemporary imaging, there is a distinct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern emerging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors describe a case and briefly review the proposed etiology, clinical and radiographic diagnosis, treatment and outcome of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 21-year-old male sustained a femur fracture after a motor vehicle accident and had delayed pulmonary and neurological deterioration 2 days following injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI of the brain demonstrated a pattern of diffuse punctuate hyperintense signal on T2-weighted and diffusion weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This "starfield" pattern reversed on follow-up MRI at 1 month, and occurred in conjunction with remarkable clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case highlights the MRI findings associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath>, their reversibility, and offers insight into the significant clinical improvement that may occur in such patients </plain></SENT>
