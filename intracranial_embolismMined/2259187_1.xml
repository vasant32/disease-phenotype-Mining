<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A decrease in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> occurred during the 30-year observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients was 48 years, and men were more frequently affected than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the course of the investigation, a rise in isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> was noted, whereas the number of patients with isolated involvement of the mitral valve and combined mitral-aortic valvular defects declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Streptococci (57%) were the most frequent pathogens isolated; as opposed to their increase, the percentages of Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Otolaryngological, dentogenic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0080276" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urogenital diseases</z:e> were most frequently held to be responsible for the development of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior cardiosurgical interventions became increasingly significant as a cause of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this connection, a rising percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> cases was linked with prosthetically replaced heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications and concomitant symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> included the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001859'>renal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the marked decrease in mortality contrasted with a simultaneous rise in the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> cases achieving full recovery </plain></SENT>
