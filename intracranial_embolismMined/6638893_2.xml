<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On one hand, climatic parameters were selected: atmospheric pressure, temperature of the air under shelter, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction, hydrometeors and electrometeors; on the other hand, parameters of solar and planetary activity: daily flare index, AA index, Ap index or daily planetary index, phases of the moon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analytic study concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vascular accidents (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and cerebral accidents <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> together) enabled to us to notice a higher frequency of vascular accidents in various meteorological circumstances: atmospheric pressure lower than 990 mb, temperature lower than 12 degrees, wind of sector North to South-South West, hoar-frost with fog, rain, snow, first quarter of the moon, daily flare index lower than 530, magnetic activity lower than 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A factorial analysis of correspondence enabled to us to understand the problem better and to determine "an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area" in which main meteorological factors appeared: low or decreasing atmospheric pressure, relative or increasing humidity, clear or increasing solar activity, steady magnetic activity; other factors could play an apparently less important role: low temperature, snow, decrease of wind speed, full moon, wind of sector East to North-East, South-South West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently it appeared in that study that the occurrence of myocardium <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> corresponded to a climatic tendency corresponding to cold, bad or deteriorating weather </plain></SENT>
