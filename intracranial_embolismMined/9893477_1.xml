<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the "old old" group, non valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (75.8%) was the most common underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and so was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> (33.3%) in the "non-old" group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediate anticoagulation (A/C) within 14 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was performed in more than 70% of the "non-old" and the "young old" groups but in only 57.6% of the "old old" group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A/C after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage was done in more than 80% of those in the "non-old" and the "young old" groups, but in less than 30% of those in the "old old" group (Chi square test, p = 0.0514) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the elderly may be characterized as follows: (1) non valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is the most common, (2) severe neurologic deficits on admission and large lesions on CT are noted, (3) complications (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>) often occur, (4) A/C in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stages are done infrequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the indication and intensity of A/C for primary and secondary prevention and prevention of complications are important in management of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
