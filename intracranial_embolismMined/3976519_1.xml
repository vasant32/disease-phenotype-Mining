<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reconstruction of the mitral valve rather than replacement is particularly applicable to this pathologic defect, but is not often used in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experience with reconstruction of the mitral valve for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> secondary to MVP during the period January 1970 to January 1984 was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 479 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> underwent operation during this period, 82 (17%) of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> secondary to MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients (6%) had valve reconstruction by a technique of leaflet plication and posteromedial anuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven of these patients had associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> requiring correction: 2 requiring aortic valve replacement and 9 requiring coronary artery bypass grafting procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (3%) and 6 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (19%) occurred, of which only 3 were related to cardiac factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major complications included recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> in 5 patients and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted 5-year survival rate was 89 +/- 6 (mean +/- standard error of the mean), and the overall survival rate of patients free of cardiac-related complications was 73 +/- 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, reconstruction of the mitral valve is a highly effective surgical approach to the management of symptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> secondary to MVP, and its use is favored over replacement in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
