<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current research focused on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery has missed important opportunities for additional understanding by failing to consider the range of different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed and implemented a classification system to identify the distribution and timing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a regional study of 388 patients with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after isolated CABG surgery in northern New England from 1992 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on patient and disease characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative care, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> etiology was classified into 1 of the following: <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, thromboembolic (embolic, thrombotic, lacunar), hypoperfusion, other (subtype not listed above), multiple (&gt;or=2 competing mechanisms), or unclassified (unknown mechanism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reliability of the classification system was determined by percent agreement and kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> accounted for 62.1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, followed by multiple etiologies (10.1%), hypoperfusion (8.8%), lacunar (3.1%), thrombotic (1.0%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (1.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with unknown etiology (13.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> classified as "other." Nearly 45% (105/235) of the embolic and 56% (18/32) of hypoperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred within the first postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We used a locally developed classification system to determine the etiologic mechanism of 388 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> secondary to CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The principal etiologic mechanism was embolic, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> having multiple mechanisms and hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regardless of mechanism, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> predominantly occurred within the first postoperative day </plain></SENT>
