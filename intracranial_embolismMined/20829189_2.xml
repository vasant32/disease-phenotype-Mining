<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this prospective pilot study was to analyse the incidence and possible impact of cryo ablation on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> and possible differences to radiofrequency (RF) ablation during pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Pulmonary vein isolation was performed in 89 patients, either with the cryoballoon technique (n = 45) or with RF ablation (n = 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">Phenprocoumon</z:chebi> was stopped 3 days before intervention and replaced by subcutaneous low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the catheter procedure, an infusion of unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was maintained to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) of &gt; 300 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed 1 day before and after PVI, and at 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> lesions were observed in 11 patients (12.3%) before PVI without statistically significant difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had neurological symptoms during or following the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (7.9%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesions 1 day after PVI, without statistically significant difference between the group treated by cryoenergy (8.9%) and RF ablation (6.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesions were significantly older compared with those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> during follow-up were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A considerable portion of patients with AF but without any neurological symptoms had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> before PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesions could be added after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both ablation techniques showed additional cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesions with no neurological symptoms after PVI </plain></SENT>
