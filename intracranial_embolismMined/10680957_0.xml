<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hour after i.v. injection of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-DMO small cerebral ischemic foci were produced in rabbits by injecting plastic beads into the left heart ventricle under short-acting anaesthesia, and after another hour the animals were put to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and their brains processed for autoradiography of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-DMO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> was in general not found in the microischemic regions, though there were a few possible exceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However in the hippocampus a diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> involving a large part of the structure, could be found in 2 of the 4 experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This hippocampal phenomenon probably reflected the same process as has been observed using autoradiography of 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> (reflecting cellular <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake) on the same ischemic model increased 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because the hippocampus is involved in the memory function and the fact that small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are coupled to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, this phenomenon should be drawn into focus for further studies </plain></SENT>
