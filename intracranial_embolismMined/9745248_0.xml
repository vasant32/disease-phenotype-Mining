<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography at 2 and 8 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> revealed arteriovenous shunts from the vermian branch of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery of the right inferior vermian vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The shunts mimicked the arteriovenous shunts of post-recanalization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but were finally diagnosed as a pre-existing congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> based on their persistence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arteriovenous shunts that persists more than 2 weeks after ictus should be differentiated from the post-recanalization arteriovenous shunts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, as the different etiology may affect the ultimate prognosis and course of treatment </plain></SENT>
