<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively assessed the clinical course and outcome of left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in pediatric patients to find out the prognostic significance of the presence and size of echocardiographically detected vegetations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the children admitted to our institution with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> between January 1987 and October 1999, 16 patients (mean age 9.03 +/- 4.95 years) who met the Duke criteria for the diagnosis of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264757" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rheumatic valvular disease</z:e> was the most frequent underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (10 patients: 62.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients were operated at a mean of 13.9 months before <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had residual defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vegetation was detected in 11 cases (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had major complications (within 2 weeks in 6 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>), six had intracranial and one had lower extremity emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among them four were operated because of complications (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>: 3 cases, intracranial emboli: 1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the operated cases are doing well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between intracranial embolic events and echocardiographically detected vegetations was determined by calculating specificity (40%), sensitivity (100%), positive predictive value (50%), and negative predictive value (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial embolism</z:e> occurred in patients without vegetations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> vegetations were &lt; or = 6 mm in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, three of which were because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that intracranial emboli have a major risk of mortality in left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The larger size of the vegetation is not a predictor of complications; furthermore, the absence of vegetations predicts that the patient is safe from embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with left-sided IE should be considered for earlier surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
