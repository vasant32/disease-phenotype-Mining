<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To report a case of cerebral artery gas embolism (CAGE), following fine needle biopsy of the lung, and to discuss the pathophysiology and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A 65-year-old woman presented to an emergency department with the clinical features of a right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> following a fine needle biopsy of the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME: Computed tomography (CT) was performed after an unexpected deterioration in the woman's condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CT demonstrated the presence of intracranial translucencies consistent with CAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was initiated but, despite two courses, the woman's condition continued to deteriorate and she died two days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CAGE is a known but little appreciated complication of fine needle biopsy of the lung, and may be clinically indistinguishable from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment is dependent on early recognition and application of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which appears to protect against injury and reverse many of the pathological changes associated with CAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increasing popularity of fine needle biopsy of the lung as an outpatient procedure is likely to result in further presentations with CAGE to emergency departments </plain></SENT>
