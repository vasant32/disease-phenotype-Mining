<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to characterize alterations in AC after sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by injection of 900 microspheres into the right (ipsilateral) internal carotid artery of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microsphere embolism (ME) decreased the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-sensitive AC activity in the ipsilateral hippocampus examined up to 7 days after the embolism, whereas basal and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24460">5'-guanylyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48497">imidodiphosphate</z:chebi>-sensitive AC activities were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An immunoreactivity of type I adenylyl cyclase (AC-I) was decreased in the ipsilateral hippocampus during these periods, whereas type V/VI AC and VIII AC immunoreactivities were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a selective reduction in the AC-I level and activity is induced by ME, which may lead to dysfunction of AC signal transduction </plain></SENT>
