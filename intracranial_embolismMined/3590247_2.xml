<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A population-based study of the relation between hematocrit and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype was carried out among 2,077 individuals using the Lehigh Valley <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This register identifies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to the 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care hospitals serving the Lehigh Valley area of eastern Pennsylvania-western New Jersey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean hematocrit was higher in patients with lacunes than with thrombotic or embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, when blood pressure was also considered the increase in hematocrit in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was significant only when systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (greater than or equal to 150 mm Hg) was also present (p = 0.029); no significant difference in hematocrit was found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes in normotensive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> interacts with hematocrit in accounting for the observed association with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no trend for increased in-hospital mortality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in either the low (less than or equal to 30, 30-36%) or high (greater than or equal to 47%) hematocrit groups </plain></SENT>
