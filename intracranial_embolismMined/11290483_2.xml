<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used an in vitro model to determine the frequency of occurrence of air emboli during catheter flushing using conventional hardware and techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two experimental models were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first incorporated an in-line bubble trap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten members of our angiography section flushed this system in their usual fashion and then with two modifications of the hardware </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The trap was inspected after each trial of seven injections and any visible bubble was measured with calipers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second model used a peristaltic pump along with a transcranial Doppler device to look at the relative number of bubble events with modifications of the flush solution or technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The closed-flush set in common usage in our department caused an increase in the number of visible bubbles in the trap as compared with an open basin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Degassing the solution and delaying injection decreased the number of bubble events noted in model 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bubble emboli are commonplace during flushing of angiography catheters when using conventional techniques and equipment </plain></SENT>
