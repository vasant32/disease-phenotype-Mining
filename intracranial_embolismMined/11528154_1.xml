<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relationship between the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We classified 69 patients under 50 years old (49 men and 20 women, aged 43.6 +/- 7.3 years) based on magnetic resonance imaging findings as follows: NC patients (n = 38; 10 with NC on the right side, 18 with NC on the left side, and 10 with NC on both sides) and non-NC patients (n = 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the following clinical characteristics between the two groups: (1) risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, and smoking and (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was more frequent in the NC group than in the non-NC group (58 vs. 19%, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was more frequent in patients with left-side NC than in those with right-side NC (78 vs. 20%, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other differences were observed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients presented with atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 16 with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 24 with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 17 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of miscellaneous etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NC was significantly more common in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as compared with those affected by other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found a significant relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and NC of the ventrolateral medulla oblongata on the left side in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients younger than 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
