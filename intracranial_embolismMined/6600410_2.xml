<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coronary bypass was performed in 23 patients, valve replacement in 16 and combined coronary and valve surgery in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were four early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> due to cardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative complications occurred in 58% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were seven late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, five in the valve replacement groups and two in the isolated coronary bypass group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative survival rate 5 years after surgery was estimated at 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While 82% of the survivors were in functional class III or IV before surgery, 90% were in class I or II when last seen, after an average postoperative follow-up of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonfatal late complications occurred in eight of the survivors, one of whom suffered a major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, open-heart operations can be offered to the elderly, with a low risk of operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The late clinical improvement, with a return to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lifestyle, justifies a surgical approach for patients in otherwise good general condition </plain></SENT>
