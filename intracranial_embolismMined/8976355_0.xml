<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a complex case of combined carotid endarterectomy, innominate artery reconstruction, and coronary artery bypass procedures in which intraoperative monitoring with somatosensory evoked potentials and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography combined with postoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic scans was used to correlate intraoperative events with cerebral activity and functional results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although computed tomographic scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical evaluation were negative for any evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the patient exhibited subtle postoperative changes in neuropsychologic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes were correlated with intraoperative microemboli detected by transcranial Doppler monitoring, and postoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic scanning, which revealed bilateral cortical defects </plain></SENT>
