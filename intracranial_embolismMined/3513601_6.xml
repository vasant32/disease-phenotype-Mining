<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>(WB X C57BL/6)F1-W/WV mice possess a genetic defect in multipotential hematopoietic stem cells; the mice are anemic and lack mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors injected diluted India ink intravenously into W/WV mice and congenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> +/+ mice and searched for genetically determined differences in the development of complications of the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both W/WV and +/+ mice, intravenous ink resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and markedly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003010'>prolonged bleeding times</z:hpo>, as well as prolonged partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times and reduced fibrinogen concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These effects were similar in W/WV and +/+ mice, although the reduction in platelet counts was greater in W/WV mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mortality associated with ink injection was significantly higher in W/WV mice than in congenic +/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most W/WV mice which died first exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, and examination under the dissection microscope revealed that ink injection resulted in significantly more cerebral thromboemboli in W/WV mice than in +/+ controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation from +/+ mice corrected both the mast cell deficiency and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of W/WV mice and protected the W/WV recipients from the adverse consequences of ink injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, +/+ mice rendered as anemic as W/WV mice by breeding did not exhibit increased morbidity and mortality after ink injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(WC X C57BL/6)F1-Sl/Sld mice, which are anemic and lack mast cells because of a genetic defect different from that of W/WV mice, also exhibited increased morbidity and mortality after intravenous ink </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, mixture of ink with commercial <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> prior to intravenous injection markedly reduced the incidence of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in W/WV mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased morbidity and mortality exhibited by W/WV and Sl/Sld mice that received injected ink might be related to their mast cell deficiency rather than to their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>But measurement of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> content of the blood and various tissues of WBB6F1-+/+ mice injected with ink, and examination of their tissues in 1-mu sections, indicated that intravenous ink did not cause substantial mast cell degranulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As a result, the possibility that mast cells protect +/+ mice from the adverse effects of intravenous ink by a mechanism other than degranulation and release of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, or that the differences in the response of W/WV or Sl/Sld mice and their +/+ littermates are due to defects other than their lack of mast cells, cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
