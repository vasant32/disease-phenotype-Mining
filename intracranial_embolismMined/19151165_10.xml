<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to investigate the impact of frailty on the utilisation of antithrombotics and on clinical outcomes in older people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: prospective study of a cohort of 220 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inpatients aged &gt; or =70 years with AF, admitted to a teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia (April-July 2007), with 207 followed up over 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: a total of 140 patients (64%) were identified as frail using a validated tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frail patients were less likely to receive <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> than non-frail on hospital admission (P = 0.002) and discharge (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During hospitalisation, the proportion of frail participants prescribed <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> decreased by 10.7% and that of non-frail increased by 6.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the 6-month follow-up, 43 major or severe haemorrhages (20.8%), 20 cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (9.7%) and 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (19.2%) were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to non-frail, frail participants were significantly more likely to experience embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (RR 3.5, 95% CI 1.0-12.0, P &lt; 0.05), had a small non-significant increase in risk of major haemorrhage (RR 1.5, 95% CI = 0.7-3.0, P = 0.29) and had greater mortality (RR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-6.5, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: frail older inpatients with AF are significantly less likely to receive <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> than non-frail and appear more vulnerable to adverse clinical outcomes, with and without antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
