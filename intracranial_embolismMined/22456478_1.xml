<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Late results of percutaneous mitral commissurotomy were assessed in 1024 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Good immediate results, defined as valve area ≥1.5 cm(2) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> &gt;2/4, were obtained in 912 patients (89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 912 patients were randomly split into 2 cohorts comprising 609 and 303 patients that were used to develop and validate, respectively, a scoring system predicting late functional results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 20-year rate of good functional results (survival without cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, mitral surgery, or repeat percutaneous mitral commissurotomy and in New York Heart Association class I or II) was 30.2 ± 2.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariable Cox model identified 7 predictive factors of poor late functional results: higher final mean gradient (P&lt;0.0001), interaction between age and final mitral valve area (P&lt;0.0001) showing that the impact of valve area decreases with age, interaction between sex and valve calcification (P&lt;0.0001) showing that the impact of valve <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> is stronger in men, and interaction between rhythm and New York Heart Association class showing an impact of New York Heart Association class only in patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 13-point score enabled 3 risk groups to be defined, corresponding to predicted good functional results of 55.1%, 29.1%, and 10.5% at 20 years in the validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Twenty years after percutaneous mitral commissurotomy in a population of patients with varied characteristics, 30% still had good functional results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prediction of late functional results is multifactorial and strongly determined by age and the quality of immediate results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A simple validated scoring system is useful for estimating individual patient outcome </plain></SENT>
