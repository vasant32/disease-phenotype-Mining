<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antiaggregant therapy can reduce the formation of microthrombi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) and triflusal (2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48076">acetoxy</z:chebi>-4-tri-fluoromethylbenzonic acid) on the formation of microthrombi after middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six groups of rats, each consisting of six animals received either <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> or triflusal at dosages of 12.5, 25 or 50 mg/1,000 g b.wt./day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One control group was sham-operated, in another control group <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was performed; both groups received no therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of microthrombi was counted 7 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion on paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest number of microthrombi was found in the group with MCAO and without therapy (mean 28 microthrombi/animal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In treated groups a reduction of the number of microthrombi could be stated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The strongest reduction was achieved in the group treated with 12.5 mg triflusal (mean 5.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistic significant difference in the number of microthrombi was found between the groups treated with 12.5 mg triflusal and 50 mg <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (mean 8.7) compared to sham-operated control animals (mean 4.3, p greater than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 12.5 mg triflusal was superior to 50 mg <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in preventing microthrombi formation (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate, that in experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> the number of microthrombi can be effectively reduced by application of antiaggregatory drugs </plain></SENT>
