<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) are frequently observed by transcranial Doppler ultrasound after prosthetic heart valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether these <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> are due to solid or gaseous particles is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> are gaseous and that if they are due to cavitation effects, their occurrence should respond to changes of dissolved oxygen concentration in the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial monitoring of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was performed in five patients with prosthetic aortic valves, who inspired 100% oxygen through a facial mask </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient 100% oxygen was administered under hyperbaric (2.5 kPa) conditions in a hyperbaric chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inspiration of 100% oxygen reduced the total number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> from 96/30 min to 2/30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the hyperbaric chamber led to an increase from 0.3 MES per minute (1.0 kPa) to 0.9 MES per minute (2.5 kPa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The dependence of occurrence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves on the oxygen partial pressure in blood provides strong evidence that these microemboli are gaseous </plain></SENT>
