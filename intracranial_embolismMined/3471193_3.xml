<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 29 fatal cases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent an autopsy) and in 20 of these the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was considered to be the major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 15 of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> the diagnosis was not suspected before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 27 cases (18 proven) the underlying cause was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, while only two cases (both confirmed) were associated with oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
