<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although surgical intervention is often used in the treatment of prosthetic valve infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (PVIE), an understanding of its effect on survival has been limited by the biases of observational studies and lack of controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The International Collaboration on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>Endocarditis</z:hpo> Merged Database is a large, multicenter, international registry of patients with definite <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> by Duke criteria, including 367 patients with PVIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical, microbiologic, and echocardiographic variables were analyzed to determine those factors associated with the use of surgery for PVIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was performed to create a propensity model of predictors of surgery use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent surgery during initial hospitalization were matched by propensity score with patients treated with medical therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine variables independently associated with inhospital mortality in this matched subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surgical therapy for PVIE was performed in 148 (42%) of 367 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhospital mortality was similar for patients treated with surgery compared with those treated with medical therapy alone (25.0% vs 23.4%, P = .729) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical therapy was independently associated with patient age, microorganism, intracardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for these determinants, inhospital mortality was predicted by brain embolization (OR 11.12, 95% CI 4.16-29.73) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318973" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Staphylococcus aureus infection</z:e> (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.29-9.74), with a trend toward benefit for surgery (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.23-1.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the frequent use of surgery for the treatment of PVIE, this condition continues to be associated with a high inhospital mortality rate in the contemporary era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for factors related to surgical intervention, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> and S aureus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were independently associated with inhospital mortality and a trend toward a survival benefit of surgery was evident </plain></SENT>
