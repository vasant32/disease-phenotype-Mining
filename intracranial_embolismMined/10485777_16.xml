<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small emboli may gain access to the systemic circulation via a transpulmonary route or through a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the incidence of cerebral microembolism after tourniquet release by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography and its correlation with echogenic material detected in the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two adult patients (9 men, 13 women) undergoing TKA were studied with simultaneous TCD ultrasonography and transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were recorded after anesthesia induction and tourniquet inflation and during tourniquet deflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emboli counts were performed manually off-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echogenic material in the left atrium was qualitatively assessed and correlated with TCD data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined postoperatively for focal neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients had unilateral TKA (six left, nine right) and seven had bilateral TKA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral emboli</z:e> were detected in 9 of 15 patients (60%) with unilateral TKA and in 4 of 7 patients (57%) with bilateral TKA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Echogenic material was identified in the left atrium in eight patients (two through a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> and six from the pulmonary veins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Emboli counts were significantly higher in patients with bilateral TKA compared with those with unilateral TKA (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Duration of tourniquet time in patients with emboli was longer only during bilateral TKA (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with echogenic material in the left atrium detected by transesophageal echocardiography had emboli as assessed by TCD ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No focal neurologic deficits were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral microembolism occurs frequently during tourniquet release, even in the absence of a patient foramen ovale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This passage most likely occurs through the pulmonary capillaries or the opening of recruitable pulmonary vessels </plain></SENT>
