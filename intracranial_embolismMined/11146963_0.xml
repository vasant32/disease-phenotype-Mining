<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many studies conclude that air microbubbles predominantly are responsible for this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A dynamic bubble trap (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi>) was developed to diminish the number of microbubbles in the arterial line of extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> is able to substantially reduce the number of air microbubbles, as shown in two patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, where a high number of microbubbles was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although a 40-micron arterial filter was used, many bubbles larger than 40 microns occurred in the arterial line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> reduced the number of large microbubbles from 2,267 to 67 in patient 1 and from 897 to 61 in patient 2 </plain></SENT>
