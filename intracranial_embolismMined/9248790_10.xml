<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) features of corpus callosum (CC) infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively 352 consecutive cranial CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans showing cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the CC was identified in 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Infarctions of the CC were diffuse (n = 3) or focal (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The former were seen in the setting of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter were divided into those affecting predominantly the genu, body or splenium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common location of the insult was the splenium (n = 13), followed by the body (n = 6) and genu (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining three patients combined genu/body infarctions were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infarction of the CC may be more common than previously thought and is most often the result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> is better suited than CT for the detection of vascular lesions of the CC </plain></SENT>
