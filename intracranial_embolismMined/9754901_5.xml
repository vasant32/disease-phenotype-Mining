<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a common disorder with considerable mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> include cigarette smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> and these have been linked to abnormalities of haemorrheology and coagulation such as increased fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other haemorrheological abnormalities have also been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These include an elevation in the white blood cell (WBC) count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate plasma fibrinogen, WBC aggregation and the release of free radicals in thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-four patients with thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data were compared to 58 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study was carried out in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee on patients previously admitted to the medical wards with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: Plasma fibrinogen, WBC aggregation and plasma malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) were measured in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients have a significantly higher fibrinogen level (4.3+/-1.2 g/dl versus 3.1+/-0.6, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>WBC aggregation is also increased in the patient group (47.5+/-10.4% versus 42.7+/-10.6, p=0.036), as is plasma <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> (8.6+/-2.0 micromol/l versus 7.1+/-1.07, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The factor VIII <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen measured as a marker as vascular damage was also significantly higher in the patient group (251+/-87% versus 182+/-64, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was also a statistically significant correlation between fibrinogen level and WBC aggregation, and fibrinogen and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These are both statistically significant p=0.012 and p&lt;0.001 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We believe our study suggests that enhanced WBC aggregation/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> with release of free radicals may be another mechanism whereby fibrinogen exerts its known detrimental effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This may allow planning of therapeutic strategies as yet undeveloped </plain></SENT>
