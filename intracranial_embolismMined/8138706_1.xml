<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two cases of complications of femoral artery cannulation in aortic arch related operations were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first case of them, we encountered massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> after concurrent CABG and aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient also had untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was strongly suspected that retrograde perfusion from femoral artery cannulation made the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> free and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> subsequently occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second case was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> with massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ascending and arch aorta replacement with resuspension of aortic valve was performed under selective cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the operation, myonephropathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> appeared maybe for occlusion of femoral artery during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient needed to receive hemodialysis therapy for three weeks after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Through these two cases of complications of femoral artery cannulation, the potential of trouble in retrograde perfusion from femoral artery was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After these experiences, we planed to avoid retrograde perfusion from femoral artery as far as possible, especially in cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> or possibly detachable atheroma in <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi> descending or abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cases, in which femoral artery cannulation can not be avoided, the duration of femoral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> should be made as short as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In order to shorten the duration, we usually make one supplemental branch in aortic prosthetic graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After completion of aortic reconstruction, the perfusion in the rewarming period is made through the supplemental branch and the femoral artery can be perfused earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This supplemental branch is useful in preventing myonephropathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> after surgery, especially in cases of prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time </plain></SENT>
