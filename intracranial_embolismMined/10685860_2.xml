<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reason(s) for this difference remains speculative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of cerebral microemboli as detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) along the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of consecutive patients examined for the presence of cerebral microembolism during a 32-month period at the Neurovascular Laboratory were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the original 375 TCD studies in 268 patients, 28 studies in 24 patients demonstrated microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) and monitored the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA on the same side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD studies were performed on TC-2000 or TC-2020 instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> positive studies were saved and off-line reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> satisfied previously established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were more frequent in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> than the ACA in 85.7% (24/28) of studies (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the total number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (n = 979), 29.6% (n = 290) were detected in the ACA and 70.4% (n=689) in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- SD) intensity of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> of 12.2 (+/- 2.4) dB was significantly lower than that of ACA <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> of 14.8 (+/-3.2) dB (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/-SD) duration of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> of 38.1 (+/- 45.3) ms was longer than that of ACA <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> of 30.7 (+/-34.0) ms (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral microembolism occurs more frequently in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> than the ACA, which may explain the uneven distribution of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> along these arterial territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there are significant differences in the characteristics of ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
