<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To analyze the effects of substrain and gender differences in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and distal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) branching patterns on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, we compared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes produced by photothrombotic distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion using SHR/Kyushu and SHR/Izumo (Izm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four male and 8 female SHR/Kyushu, 15 male and 5 female SHR/Izm, and 6 male Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY)/Izm (5 to 7 months old) were subjected to photothrombotic distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although blood pressure levels were essentially the same between the two substrains of hypertensive rats, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were significantly larger in the SHR/Kyushu substrain than in SHR/Izm of either sex (P&lt;0.001); <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in male and female SHR/Kyushu were 83.8+/-11.7 and 58.5+/-9.2 mm3, and those in male and female SHR/Izm were 61.5+/-10.7 and 34.8+/-7.9 mm3, respectively (values are mean+/-SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male SHR/Kyushu that had simple Y-shaped <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> showed smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (75.8+/-14.6 mm3, n=11) than those with more branching (regular) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (93.2+/-19.1, n=13), the difference being significant (P=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male SHR/Izm with simple distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> also produced smaller infarctions than those with regular <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (51.0+/-3.7 versus 68.9+/-8.7 mm3, P=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Photothrombotic occlusion of distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in hypertensive rats provides a simple and reproducible model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, this study emphasizes the substantial variabilities in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes caused by the differences in substrains of SHR, gender, and distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> patterns </plain></SENT>
