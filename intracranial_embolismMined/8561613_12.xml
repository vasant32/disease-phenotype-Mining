<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is interest in expanding ventricular assist device use from short-term bridging to transplantation to long-term and permanent support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have reviewed the outcome of 162 patients who had as mechanical bridge to transplantation that lasted at least 60 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five patients received the HeartMate, 40 the Novacor, and 37 the Thoratec device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 162 patients, 125 received transplants, and 115 survived after transplantation (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the group there were 174 complications including 54 infections of the driveline, 73 other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic strokes</z:hpo> in 47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e> of the driveline were considered major in 24 of 54 cases, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were major in 36 of 73 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of those who sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> had residual effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 11 patients with a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, only 1 survived transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two patients were supported between 60 and 100 days, 63 patients between 101 and 200 days, 12 patients between 201 and 300 days, and only 5 patients in excess of 300 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A greater percentage of candidates died waiting between 101 and 200 days than between 60 and 100 days (25% versus 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of complications also rose in those patients bridged more than 100 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data reinforce the excellent results obtained in the bridge to transplantation trials that reported a shorter duration of support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For those interested in extended bridge to transplantation or permanent use of the currently available devices, the results suggest reasonable success can be anticipated, but the serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> tend to be more common with longer duration of support </plain></SENT>
