<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases focal neurological deficits and impaired consciousness occurred after a short period of non-specific clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography revealed bilateral hemorrhagic infarctions of thalamus and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CSF analysis which was performed in two cases showed pleocytosis, increased protein level, disturbed blood-brain barrier, and signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two cases the diagnosis was confirmed by transfemoral carotid angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed in one case only and showed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with high-dose heparine in spite of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Good recovery was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with almost complete improvement of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No complications were observed during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of these promising therapeutic results, bilateral thalamic lesions should alert the physician to consider the possibility of deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
