<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection was performed with 1-h, bilateral middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) insonation using a transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) machine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients with definite native-valve IE were stratified into 2 groups based upon the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most striking difference between the 2 groups of patients was the incidence of clinically evident neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological complications of IE occurred in 10 (83.3%) patients with positive <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and in 6 (33.3%) <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-negative patients (p=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was the most common complication, occurring in 11 of 16 patients, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in 4 patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebritis</z:e> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards greater in-hospital mortality in patients with recorded <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> than in the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-negative, although this was not statistically significant (33.3% vs 16.6%; p=0.392) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal a significant association between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and neurological complications in patients with native-valve IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TCD is a promising tool in predicting individual patient risk for neurological complications of IE </plain></SENT>
