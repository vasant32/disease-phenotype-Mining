<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals were initially treated after four hours while the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> remained occluded and a series of tests was used to evaluate the neurological and cerebral status of each monkey for seven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results show that the gross, microscopic and angiographical picture of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> and no-treatment controls was practically identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, DMSO-treated monkeys showed significant protection from the severe neurological deficits seen in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that DMSO has a positive effect in reducing the neurological deficits seen in this model and may be potentially useful in clinical emoblic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
