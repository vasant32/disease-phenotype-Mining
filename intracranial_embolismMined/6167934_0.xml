<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred patients with focal cerebral ischaemic attacks of suspected embolic origin were investigated by Holter monitoring to determine whether paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> may have been responsible for the episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 57 men and 43 women aged from 16 to 79 years (mean 50 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven had residual focal neurological deficits and 3 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neurological lesions were verified by cerebral angiography in 68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one had arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 9 had old <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were in sinus rhythm, 4 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo> on routine ECG, and 4 had supraventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients were receiving anti-arrythmic drugs at the time of investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Holter monitoring was performed for 18 hours in 91 cases and for 24-54 hours in the remaining ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The interval between the cerebral ischaemic attack and the monitoring was less than one month (mean 20 days) for 50 patients and longer for the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cardiac arrythmias were found in 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixteen had more than 10 supraventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> per hour, 13 had runs of 3 to 8 beats of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, 1 had an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eighteen subjects had more than 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo> per hour, 1 had accelerated ventricular rhythm, 2 had runs of 4 to 7 beats of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients had second degree A.V. block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>None had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> during monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Arrythmias were increasingly frequent with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our findings are similar to those obtained with monitoring in ambulatory asympatomatic subjects of the same age without apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> reported by other authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the frequency of arrythmia was unrelated to the time elapsed between the ischaemic attack and Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Holter monitoring performed several weeks after suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> failed to reveal arrythmias likely to be responsible for a focal cerebral ischaemic attack </plain></SENT>
