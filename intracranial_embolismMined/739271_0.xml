<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These consist of beams of sub-atomic particles, particularly of protons and other heavy ions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With these beams radiographs of unusually high contrast are obtained for the visualization and differentiation of the soft body tissues at very low doses (down to approximately two orders of magnitude less than with x-rays) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method is practical for use in hospitals and has potential for screening purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The properties of these and other sub-atomic particles are reviewed for their diagnostic and basic research potential </plain></SENT>
