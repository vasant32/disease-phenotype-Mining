<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to elucidate the pathological and pathophysiological characteristics of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was also to clarify whether this animal model is useful for the research of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to create a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model, arterioles were embolized by injecting 2000 carbon-microspheres (50 microns in diameter) into the right internal carotid artery of ketamine anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathological studies and pathophysiological evaluations were performed by electrocorticography (ECoG) and by measuring regional cortical blood flow (CBF) in embolized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An attempt was also made to examine learning ability: embolized rats were subjected to the passive avoidance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathophysiological studies revealed most microspheres to be located in the ipsilateral hemisphere with a few in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most foci of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were distributed in the area fed by the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery and the anterior cerebral artery, while a few of them were found in the area fed by the contralateral anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> consisted of microcerebral infarctions, some of which were fused to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathological characteristics of this experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were those of multifocal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both ECoG and CBF decreased after injection of carbon-microspheres, and these two parameters did not recover for more than 60 min in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven days after cerebral embolization, the shortened response latency in the passive avoidance test, possibly indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> of the rat produced by carbon-microspheres (50 microns in diameter) is useful in the pathophysiological investigation of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
