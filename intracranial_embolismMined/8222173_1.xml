<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the incidence of gaseous microemboli during 150-minute hypothermic (28 degrees C) cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) adversely affects CBF (radioactive microspheres) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty anesthetized dogs were placed on CPB using bubble oxygenators with 50% O2 (n = 10) or 100% O2 (n = 10) to produce a wide range in the number of gaseous microemboli or membrane oxygenators with 50% O2 (n = 10) to avoid microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of carotid artery microemboli occurring in a 1-minute interval was counted using a 5-MHz Doppler probe every 15 minutes for the duration of CPB, which lasted 258 +/- 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With bubbled 100% O2, the number of microemboli averaged 4.1 +/- 1.7 emboli per minute on normothermic bypass and increased with cooling to 18.3 +/- 4.9 emboli per minute (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With bubbled 50% O2, the microemboli number was greater on normothermic bypass (19.8 +/- 9.8 emboli per minute, P = .0653 compared with bubbled 100% O2) and increased with cooling (100.3 +/- 18.7 emboli per minute, P &lt; .001) to a greater extent than with bubbled 100% O2 (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, with membrane 50% O2, the emboli number was small (0.6 +/- 0.1 emboli per minute) and did not change with CPB temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CBF values were not reduced after termination of CPB, even when compared with prebypass values, being 48.3 +/- 7.5 mL/min per 100 g (bubbled 50% O2), 49.6 +/- 4.1 mL/min per 100 g (bubble 100% O2), and 44.5 +/- 2.8 mL/min per 100 g (membrane 50% O2, P = .7581) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, regional perfusion to the cerebellum, hippocampus, and caudal brainstem was not adversely affected by microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After CPB, cortical biopsies demonstrated no difference among groups with respect to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (P = .1753), energy charge (P = .5179), and brain water content (P = .939) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> histopathology indicated no differences among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that: (1) the incidence of gaseous microemboli during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> increases when a bubble oxygenator is used, and (2) global CBF and regional brain perfusion are not adversely affected by numerous gaseous microemboli </plain></SENT>
