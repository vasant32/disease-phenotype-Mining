<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by embolization of calcific material from the brachiocephalic trunk, probably induced by radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF CASE: A 56-year-old right-handed female developed left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, hemihypesthesia, and sensory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">inattention</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She had a history of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> that was excised 8 years previously followed by radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had no other history of note </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography of the head and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a calcific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in right middle cerebral artery and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction in the corresponding territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plain chest radiography, carotid ultrasonography, transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography failed to demonstrate the source of calcific embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography of the thorax revealed heavy calcification of the brachiocephalic trunk and the origin of the right common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Undertaking a vigilant systematic search for the source in cases of calcific embolization is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The aorta and its main branches are possible, yet unusual, sources of calcific emboli that merit investigation </plain></SENT>
