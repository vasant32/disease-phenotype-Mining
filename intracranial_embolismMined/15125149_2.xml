<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a reliable, high-resolution, real-time automated system for the detection and archiving of embolic signals was designed and implemented using expert system theory and modern DSP technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preliminary tests were conducted to evaluate the functions and the performance of the system using data from ten carotid endarterectomy patients and two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the widely accepted 7 dB threshold for human reliability and a human expert, majority-decision gold standard, the real-time system reached sensitivity and specificity of 93.6% and 99.3%, respectively, which were close to the results obtained by three human experts under ideal laboratory conditions (90.1% and 99.8%, 98.4% and 99.9%, 98.9 and 99.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The new system has the potential to be used either as a bedside monitoring and signal acquisition device, or as a laboratory investigation tool </plain></SENT>
