<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 79 patients retrospectively who had undergone elective surgery from April 2002 through December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied their basal diseases, types of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, stopping or continuing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> during their surgical period, thrombo-embolic and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications and changing of the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thrombo-embolic complications occurred in 2 patients (2.5%) who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both of them had arythmia </plain></SENT>
