<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, epoetin alfa-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> has not previously been reported in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old patient who was receiving peritoneal dialysis and epoetin alfa (Epogen) therapy presented with a several-day history of worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and a neuroimaging scan demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sagittal and transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epoetin alfa therapy, which had been initiated 3 months earlier according to an institutional protocol, was associated with a problematic increase in hematocrit values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> should raise the suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients who are being treated with epoetin alfa, particularly in the presence of elevated hematocrit values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monitoring hematocrit parameters in accordance with "standard guidelines" is recommended </plain></SENT>
