<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>99mTc-rt-PA administered intravenously provided clearer imaging of clots after priming with cold rt-PA, with uptake peaking 5-10 minutes after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>99mTc-labeled human serum albumin was not retained at clot sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemically administered 99mTc-rt-PA binds to fibrin clots within carotid arteries in our feline model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the interaction of intrinsic plasminogen activator inhibitors with extrinsically administered rt-PA may regulate the demonstration of a clot, although the precise mechanism is unclear </plain></SENT>
