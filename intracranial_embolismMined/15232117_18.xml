<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no study that assessed the effect of age on adverse event rates in cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this retrospective analysis from <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in Cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study (PICSS) database was to assess the effect of age on the risk of adverse events in medically treated cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 250 cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients from PICSS were followed-up for 24 months, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> as primary endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios were calculated for determination of relative risk in cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in 3 age groups (younger than 55, 55 to 64, and 65 years or older) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 2 younger age groups, the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> did not significantly affect the risk of adverse events (P=0.15; hazard ratio=0.21; 95% CI, 0.02 to 1.78; 2-year event rates, 2.0% versus 9.3%; and P=0.70; hazard ratio=0.72; 95% CI, 0.14 to 3.73; 2-year event rates, 10.0% versus 13.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in those aged 65 years or older, the risk of adverse events was significantly higher in the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> (P=0.01; hazard ratio=3.21; 95% CI, 1.33 to 7.75; 2-year event rates 37.9% versus 14.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory analysis, the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in the younger cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients did not increase the risk of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in the older patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> significantly increased the risk of adverse events </plain></SENT>
