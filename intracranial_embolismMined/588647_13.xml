<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Development of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> can be blocked by postoperative treatment with the antidepressant, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47781">desmethylimipramine</z:chebi>, or by preoperative destruction of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> terminals with 6-hydroxydopamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that ischemic damage to the cerebral cortex which injures some axonal branches of elaborately arborizing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-containing neurons may alter the biochemical and functional state of the entire system in its intact collateral axons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus the concept of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as a local injury producing symptoms by local structure-function relationships is conceptually inadequate, and poststroke symptoms must be evaluated with these "whole brain" concepts in mind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the poststroke symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> may represent emotional changes which result from pathophysiological processes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> neurons far from the site of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
