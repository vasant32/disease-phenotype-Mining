<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The children consisted of 1 boy and 5 girls, from 3 to 12 years old, 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and 3 with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients received induction treatment that included intravenous administration of L-asparaginase and/or intrathecal administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient received induction treatment and consolidation treatment that included intravenous administration of L-asparaginase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient received induction and consolidation treatment, and the protocol for peripheral blood stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laboratory examinations revealed coagulation dysfunction in 3 patients treated with L-asparaginase and 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a 1.5-T unit, using spin-echo or fast spin-echo sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted images were obtained in the axial and/or coronal plane (section thickness, 4 mm; inter-section gap, 2 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI was initially performed within 36 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and follow-up MRIs were performed for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI showed lesions involving the cortex and subcortex in 4 patients with coagulation dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 2 of these 4 patients, Gd-enhanced T1-weighted images showed contrast enhancement in the surface of the gyrus, suggesting focal vascular stasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serial MRI revealed nearly complete resolution of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were relieved in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The lesions on MRI were presumed to be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> related to the coagulation dysfunction caused by L-asparaginase or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> after intrathecal administration of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, MRI revealed multiple lesions involving the centrum semiovale and periventricular white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No Gd-enhancement of the lesion was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This MRI finding was consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>As time passed, the symptoms improved completely, and the lesions became better demarcated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>MRI is useful for differentiating lesions related to coagulation dysfunction from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
