<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine risk factors predictive of microemboli found on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) following carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) with distal protection and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid interventions at a single institution between 2004 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In that time frame, 64 carotid interventions (34 CAS, 30 CEA) were performed in 63 male patients (mean age 69.5 years, range 52 to 91) with DW-MRI scans available for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, including age, gender, smoking history, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (body mass index &gt;30), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the CAS patients, anatomical and procedural characteristics, including fluoroscopy time, contrast volume, performance of an arch angiogram, and lesion <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bivariate analyses were performed to determine which parameters were associated with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postprocedural microemboli found on DW-MRI by 2 blinded neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four (71%) of the 34 CAS patients and 1 (3%) of the 30 CEA patients demonstrated new cerebral microemboli postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the bivariate analyses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient, anatomical, and procedural characteristics, only a history of CAD was associated with an increased risk of microemboli; 20 (80%) of the 25 patients who had postprocedure microemboli had CAD compared to 18 (46%) of 39 patients without microemboli (p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty (53%) of the 38 (59%) patients with CAD developed microemboli compared to 5 (19%) of the 26 patients without CAD (p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patient, procedural, and anatomical characteristics were not found to be independent risk factors predictive of postprocedure microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CAS with distal protection carries a significantly greater risk for developing new microemboli compared to CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the risk factors analyzed, only a history of CAD emerged as an independent risk factor for the development of microemboli following carotid intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding may influence the decision to perform CAS in patients deemed high risk solely due to the presence of CAD </plain></SENT>
