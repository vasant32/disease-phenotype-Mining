<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Particular attention was paid to both the neurological and general complications and to how and when the neurological symptoms appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, a cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of 3.1% was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications were classified as clamping <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (2.2%), postoperative embolism (1.5%), postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (2.4%), and cerebral haemorrhage (0.3%) </plain></SENT>
