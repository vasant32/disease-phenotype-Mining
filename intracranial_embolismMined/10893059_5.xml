<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> may be a signal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation at the stent level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two patient groups were studied with transcranial Doppler at different intervals after deployment of Palmaz stents or Wallstents for stenosis of the internal or common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1: from 6 to 12 months after stent deployment; Group 2: &gt; 12 months after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One out of 19 patients in Group 1 showed <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (5.0%); however, this patient also had two mechanical heart valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None out of 17 patients in Group 2 had <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid stents seem to have a very low emboligenic potential after the early post-deployment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is a reassuring message for present and future patients harboring such stents </plain></SENT>
