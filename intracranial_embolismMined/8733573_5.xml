<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of delayed treatment with nafronyl oxalate (nafronyl), a cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>, on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> of brain regions in the microsphere-embolized rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microsphere embolism was induced by injecting 900 microspheres with a diameter of 48 microns into the right internal carotid artery of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microsphere-embolized rats were treated with nafronyl, 15 mg kg-1, i.p., twice daily from the first to the 5th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> and their metabolites in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus were measured on days 3 and 5 after the operation by a high-performance liquid chromatograph with electrochemical detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo tyrosine or tryptophan hydroxylation was estimated by measurement of the accumulation of 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine or 5-hydroxy-1-tryptophan after administration of 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine dihydrochloride, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microsphere embolism induced decreases in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> and 5-hydroxytryptamine in three brain regions of the right hemisphere on days 3 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the left hemisphere, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> were reduced, but to a lesser degree than in the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On days 3 and 5, the decrease in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> of the right hemisphere was attenuated by nafronyl treatment except for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The decrease in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> levels in the left hemisphere was almost completely prevented by nafronyl treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On day 3 after microsphere embolism, in vivo tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylation was lower than the pre-embolic value in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the embolized rats with nafronyl significantly attenuated the decrease in in vivo tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylation in the ipsilateral hemisphere, but not hippocampal tryptophan hydroxylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that treatment with nafronyl improves or attenuates changes in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> neurotransmitter metabolism of the brain regions impaired by microsphere embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying this effect may be attributed to preservation of the ability to synthesize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> when the brain is ischaemic or oligaemic </plain></SENT>
