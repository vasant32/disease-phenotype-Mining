<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four patients were conscious when a severe lateralized neurological deficit developed three to 12 hours after injury indicating the presence of a vascular injury and not a mass lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients with occlusion of the main stem middle cerebral artery, computed tomographic (CT) scans performed between 1 and 7 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the ischemic signs were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> scans performed after 11 or more hours revealed progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in a vascular distribution leading to a midline shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fifth patient had a severe diffuse brain injury and no apparent clinical pattern of a posttraumatic vascular complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential changes on the CT scans similar to those of the other patients led to the proper diagnosis of vascular injury; this was later confirmed by arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indirect, nonpenetrating injury to the carotid artery should be suspected in the presence of the typical clinical pattern or when serial CT scans show the evolution of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in a distribution atypical for traumatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
