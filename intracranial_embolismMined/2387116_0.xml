<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was 46-year-old man and had no remarkable risk factors for the cerebrovascular disease such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed and there was the string-of-beads-like shadow in the left vertebral artery, revealing a localized FMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wedge-shaped area of low signal intensity in the left lower medulla was recognized in magnetic resonance imaging (spin echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>/Te 600/30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that the lesion of the lower medulla caused the patient's several symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Japan, there have been a few case reports of cervical or intracranial FMD, but we cannot find any report of FMD localizing in the unilateral vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, it has been said that the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> under fifty years old differs from those of geriatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors pointed out the significance of FMD as one of those risk factors causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> and also discussed the mechanism of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbance</z:e> sparing face </plain></SENT>
