<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to verify that tissue-type plasminogen activator given either 1 or 2 hours after experimental embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rabbits diminishes the volume of resulting ischemic brain and to ascertain the effect of the simultaneous administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We embolized the middle cerebral artery of rabbits by injecting performed autologous arterial ("white") <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> into one internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 2 mg/kg tissue-type plasminogen activator, alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, was commenced either 1 or 2 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed 5 hours after treatment commenced, and their brains were examined for evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Administration of tissue-type plasminogen activator significantly diminished the size of the resulting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, with or instead of tissue-type plasminogen activator, did not result in a significant decrease in the volume of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, but it also did not lead to hemorrhagic transformation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the rabbit model, administration of tissue-type plasminogen activator within 2 hours diminished the volume of brain rendered acutely ischemic by embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the simultaneous administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during this same period did not result in any instances of hemorrhagic transformation, tissue-type plasminogen activator may have some place for use in such circumstances to mitigate a tendency to further embolic or thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
