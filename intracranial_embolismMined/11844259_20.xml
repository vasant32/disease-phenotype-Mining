<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of combined intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> and to evaluate its associated risks, using magnetic resonance imaging as a triage tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous treatment followed by intra-arterial infusion may increase the rate of recanalization and lead to better clinical results, with reduced frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Attack</z:e> Team evaluated patients who presented within 3 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who did not demonstrate improvement and exhibited no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> on head computed tomographic scans were treated with intravenously administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (0.6 mg/kg) and underwent emergency magnetic resonance imaging of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted turbo-gradient and spin echo and echo-planar diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging scans were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with evidence of imaging abnormalities indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cortical infarction underwent cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After determination of vessel occlusion, intra-arterially administered urokinase (up to 750,000 units) or intra-arterially administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (maximal dose, 0.3 mg/kg) was used to achieve recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We treated 45 patients with this protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 67 +/- 13 years, and 58% of the patients were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant improvement in National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was good correlation between abnormal perfusion-weighted imaging findings and cerebral angiographic findings (complete vessel occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was 4.4% in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died in the hospital, and the majority of survivors (77%) experienced good outcomes (Barthel index of &gt;or=95) 3 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that this protocol is feasible and that combined intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> is sufficiently safe to warrant further evaluation </plain></SENT>
