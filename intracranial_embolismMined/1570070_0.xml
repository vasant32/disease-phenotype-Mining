<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 16 year-old girl was admitted to our hospital complaining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was born with an orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100764'>lymphangioma</z:hpo>, which was resected partially at a younger age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission she had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> and light neck stiffness as neurological positive findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enhanced CT scan showed an eight-figure enhancement at the straight sinus and a linear enhancement at the vermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> spreading in the deep cerebral veins and the right superior ophthalmic vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore a medullary venous malformation (MVM) was disclosed in the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of urokinase and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> relieved her symptoms gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After that treatment, partial recanalization of the deep cerebral veins and the straight sinus and disappearance of the MVM were recognized in the second angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the present case, the MVM played an important role as collateral channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But, in general, when <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> occurs, collateral circulation is maintained by cork-screw vessels, not by MVM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the light of the presence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100764'>lymphangioma</z:hpo>, the present case was thought to be a rare condition in the venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It appears that residual fetal vessels have existed in the posterior fossa from birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is considered that the residual fetal vessels opened and dilated temporally and were recognized as an MVM in angiography, when cerebral venous flow was disturbed by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
