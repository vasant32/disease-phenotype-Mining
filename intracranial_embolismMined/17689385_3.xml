<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Detecting asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> would help identify patients who would benefit from anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the application of a modified blood pressure monitor to screen for episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A modified sphygmomanometer was designed to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The device has a sensitivity near 100% and a specificity of up to 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this device can be expected to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the lower specificity may result in false-positive readings that could prompt unnecessary clinic visits for electrocardiogram confirmation of the rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outpatients in sinus rhythm with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were given the device to monitor their pulse regularity once daily to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with irregular readings were evaluated with an electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients were monitored at home for a period ranging from 5 days to 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> identified by the monitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had no irregular readings for a mean of 82 +/- 40 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 19 patients, 3 had false-positive irregular readings that were a result of sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or ectopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The device had an acceptably low false-positive rate allowing 16 of 19 patients to use it at home for long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This device may help prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> by identifying patients with prolonged episodes of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> who are candidates for anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
