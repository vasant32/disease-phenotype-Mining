<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Embolic infarctions</z:e> from the heart are known to cause multiple scattered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesions as well as single, large territorial infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unknown which factors contribute to these different infarction patterns in patients with potential cardiac sources of embolism (PCSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 388 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with a high-risk PCSE using diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infarction patterns were categorized into a single large lesion, a single small lesion, confluent and additional lesions, or small scattered lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationships between infarction patterns and clinical and hematologic parameters were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 388 patients, a single large lesion was detected in 139 (35.8%), a single small lesion in 29 (7.5%), confluent and additional lesions in 171 (44.1%), and small scattered lesions in 49 (12.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior use of antiplatelet agents and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> were associated with the pattern of small scattered lesions and a single small lesion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, higher white blood cell counts were associated with confluent and additional lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The type of high-risk PCSE was not related to a specific infarction pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that platelet function and inflammatory processes may directly affect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the cardiac chamber </plain></SENT>
