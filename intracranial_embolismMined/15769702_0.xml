<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An intensive intraoperative neurologic and physiologic monitoring approach was developed and implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms likely to produce embolic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>), hypoperfusion (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> desaturation), and hypotensive (hemodynamic changes) neurologic injuries were monitored and synchronized with the occurrence of surgical and perfusion clinical events/techniques using a case video </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The system was tested among 32 cardiac surgery patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emboli were measured in the cerebral arteries and outflow of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit among nearly 75% and 85% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> desaturation was measured among nearly 70% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic information was recorded in 100% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We developed and successfully implemented a method for detailed real-time associations between processes of clinical care and precursors of neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of this linkage will result in the redesign of clinical care to reduce a patient's risk of neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
