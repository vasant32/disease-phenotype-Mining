<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuous retrograde cerebral perfusion (CRCP) is a new and simple technique for the protection of the brain during hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied CRCP in 26 patients who underwent aortic arch surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous retrograde cerebral perfusion was performed with a mean blood flow of 383 +/- 176, range 120-800, ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of CRCP was 63 +/- 15, range 32-92, min with the superior vena cava pressure at 15-42 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No neurologic deficit was observed in 20 patients (90%) and only minor deficits in 2 out of the 22 cases without severe postoperative complications, allowing evaluation of the effectiveness of CRCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had other severe complications, and the effectiveness of the method could not be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuous retrograde cerebral perfusion can be an excellent and safe technique which avoids clamp injury during aortic arch surgery </plain></SENT>
