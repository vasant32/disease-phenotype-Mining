<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and to investigate whether 1 hr of monitoring is sufficient to detect a clinically relevant change in the number of postoperative microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the association of patient characteristics and procedure-related variables with the number of postoperative microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and two patients were monitored during the second hour after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was the number of TCD-detected microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcome measure was a procedure-related cerebral complication graded according to the modified Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median number of microemboli during the second postoperative hour was two (interquartile ranges, 0.75-11) and decreased in most the patients during this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a relatively high and increasing number of microemboli and developed a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after a symptom-free interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between patient characteristics and the use of a venous patch and the number of postoperative microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, a statistically significant negative association was found between shunt use and the number of microemboli (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients had no or a small and decreasing number of microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One hour of monitoring appeared to be effective to select those patients in whom the number of microemboli did not spontaneously decrease and who may need additional medical treatment or surgical reexploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The role of TCD-detected microemboli as a surrogate measure for the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after CEA remains to be validated </plain></SENT>
