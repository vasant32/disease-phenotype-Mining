<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>u-PA and t-PA activity in tissue are tightly regulated by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known of the activity of endogenous plasminogen activators (PAs) and PAI-1 in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether cerebral ischemic injury induces endogenous PAs and PAI-1, we measured PA activity from brain homogenates, and examined the expression of t-PA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, u-PA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and PAI-1 mRNA from brain homogenates in C57BL/6J mice (n=45) weighing 29-35 g in which the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was occluded by a fibrin-rich clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain homogenates were prepared for direct casein zymography from control non-ischemic mice (n=4) and mice at 2 h (n=5), 4 h (n=5), and 24 h (n=4) after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, u-PA and t-PA knockout mice at 4 h (n=2, each) after MCAO were used as a negative control for direct casein zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frozen sections for in situ zymography were obtained from control mice (n=2) and mice at 2 h, 4 h, and 24 h (n=2, per time point) after clot occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain homogenates were prepared for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to examine t-PA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, u-PA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and PAI-1 mRNA expression from control non-ischemic mice (n=4) and mice at 2 h (n=5), 4 h (n=5), and 24 h (n=5) after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By direct casein zymography, u-PA activity increased at 4 h (P&lt;0.05), and 24 h (P&lt;0.05) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the ischemic hemisphere compared with the non-ischemic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activity of t-PA in ischemic brain was not significantly different from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As measured by in situ zymography, PA activity, most likely u-PA, was present in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By RT-PCR, expression of PAI-1 mRNA, but not u-PA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and t-PA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, increased 3-, 15- and 25-folds in the ischemic hemisphere at 2 h, 4 h and 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, respectively, compared with control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that PAI-1 mRNA and u-PA activity increase in mouse brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
