<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is increasing in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as the population undergoes epidemiological and demographic transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the nature (risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type and subtype, and causes) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in SSA and whether it differs from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in high-income populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between black and white populations in South Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used overlapping sources to ascertain consecutive first-ever-in-a-lifetime <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to Johannesburg Hospital over 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed each patient's demographic details, risk factors, CT confirmed pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> type, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtype and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, and compared the nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between black and white <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 524 patients with presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were referred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 432 were first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>; 308 patients were black and 76 white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Black patients were significantly younger (mean age 51) than white patients (61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was similar (median NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> score 10; 95% CI 8 to 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More black than white patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (27% versus 15%), lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (28% versus 22%) and total anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (28% versus 22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Large vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (none detected) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> were very uncommon (1%) as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in black patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> (70% versus 68%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (14 versus 15%) were as common in black and white <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, but mean cholesterol levels were lower (4.6 mmol/L; 95% CI 4.3 to 4.9 versus 5.3 mmol/L; 4.8 to 5.7) and cigarette smoking less frequent in black patients (23 versus 54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although this was a hospital-based study, the difference in the nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between black and white <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients likely reflects the profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is an opportunity to prevent an otherwise inevitable increase in atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>) by targeting dietary and smoking habits in the black South African population </plain></SENT>
