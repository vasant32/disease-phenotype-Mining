<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Danish medical, neurological, neurosurgical, and gynaecological departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 794 women in Denmark aged 15-44 who had suffered a cerebral thromboembolic attack during 1985-9 and 1588 age matched randomly selected controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 692/1584 case/control questionnaires sent out, 590/1396 (85.3%/88.1%) were returned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the cases, 15 refused to participate, 69 had a revised or unreliable diagnosis, 40 had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> previously, 13 were pregnant, and 152 had a disease predisposing to a cerebral thromboembolic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 323 cases without a known predisposition, 320 reported use or non-use of oral contraception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 1396 controls, eight refused to participate, were mentally retarded, or lived abroad; 18 returned an uncompleted questionnaire; 17 had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> previously; 31 were pregnant; and 130 had a disease predisposing to a cerebral thromboembolic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus 1198 non-predisposed controls were available, among whom 1197 reported use or non-use of oral contraception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 320 cases, 116 (36.3%) were oral contraceptive users at the time of the cerebral thromboembolic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By comparison there were 191 users (16.0%) among the 1197 controls, giving a crude odds ratio of 3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After multivariate analysis, including confounder control for age, smoking, years of schooling, and trend in use of different types of oral contraceptives during 1985-90, pills containing 50 micrograms <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> were associated with an odds ratio for cerebral thromboembolic attack of 2.9 (95% confidence interval 1.6 to 5.4), those containing 30-40 micrograms <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> an odds ratio of 1.8 (1.1 to 2.9), those containing <z:chebi fb="13" ids="50745">progestogen</z:chebi> only an odds ratio of 0.9 (0.4 to 2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio did not change with increasing age or with duration of oral contraceptive use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A 50% increased risk of a cerebral thromboembolic attacks among cigarette smokers (after confounder control) was independent of oral contraception status and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low dose oral contraceptives are associated with an increased risk of cerebral thromboembolic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Combined or sequential pills containing 30-40 micrograms <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> are associated with a one third reduced risk compared with preparations containing 50 micrograms <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="13" ids="50745">Progestogen</z:chebi> only pills did not increase the risk of a cerebral thromboembolic attack </plain></SENT>
