<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The epidemic of bovine spongiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> in the United Kingdom and the recognition of a variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</z:e> prompted revision of the guidelines for slaughter of cattle and sheep to prevent contamination of the edible parts of the carcass with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that captive bolt gun stunning, which is routinely used for the slaughter of cattle and sheep, causes entry of fragments of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system tissue into the jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether such tissue can traverse pulmonary capillaries to enter the systemic circulation, we introduced small volumes of brain tissue that had been disrupted by stunning with a captive bolt gun into the jugular vein of sheep sent for slaughter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined aortic blood samples by immunocytochemistry for neurofilament and S100 proteins and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for glial fibrillary acidic protein and found fragments of neurofilament- and S100-immunopositive central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system tissue in samples from 2 of 11 sheep and elevated glial fibrillary acidic protein in 6 sheep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system tissue that is dislodged during routine captive bolt gun stunning and slaughter of sheep can enter the systemic arterial circulation and that, in some cases, this method of slaughter of an animal infected with bovine spongiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> would be likely to contaminate edible parts of the carcass with infective material </plain></SENT>
