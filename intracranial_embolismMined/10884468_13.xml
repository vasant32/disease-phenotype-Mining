<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, because of the rather poor diagnostic quality of conventional 2-D ultrasound and angiography compared with the evaluation of pathological specimens, little information exists on the natural course of carotid plaque ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the introduction of 3-D ultrasound has made reproducible investigation of plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> possible, providing a reliable plaque surface analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed 3-D ultrasound examinations of 17 carotid artery plaques with an ulcerated surface in a prospective study of 16 patients (10 men, 6 women; mean+/-SD age 68.9+/-7.1 years) over a mean observation period of 17.6+/-6.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exactly parallel B-mode ultrasound scans (slice distance 0.1 mm) were acquired with a 5-MHz linear array probe clamped in a carriage device and driven by a mechanical step motor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recorded images were reconstructed into a volumetric data set in a Cartesian coordinate system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of the observation period, surface configuration had changed in 4 cases (23.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plaque ulceration regressed in 3 cases, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> progression occurred in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 13 plaques (76 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5%) showed an unchanged surface configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Through the use of 3-D ultrasound, it is possible to noninvasively examine the regression and progression of carotid artery plaque ulceration </plain></SENT>
