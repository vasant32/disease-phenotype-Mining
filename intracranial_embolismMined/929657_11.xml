<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients admitted to Philadelphia General Hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had repeated measurements of cerebral blood flow measured by the 133Xenon inhalation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A progressive decline in cerebral blood flow in both hemispheres was observed during the first week after infarction in twelve of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This decline could be partially explained by loss of autoregulation, but could not be correlated with level of consciousness, clinical status of PCO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This progressive decline in flow in the non-ischemic hemisphere indicates a process more complex than a simple destruction of axonal afferants to neurons as implied by the term diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The flow changes in the non-ischemic hemisphere are likely caused by a combination of the immediate effects of decreased neuronal stimulation modified by loss of autoregulation, release of vasoactive substances, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, and other factors </plain></SENT>
