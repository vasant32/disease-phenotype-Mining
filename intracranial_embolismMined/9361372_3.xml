<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three trials were carried out, in which garlic at doses of 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each trial included treatment groups of male mice, approximately 30 g, and a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were anesthetized (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi>, 1-2 mg/g, i.p.), the trachea was intubated and a craniotomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of platelet aggregation was made by activation of circulating <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> (0.1 ml of 5% solution/25 g, i.v.) with an intense mercury light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Garlic, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and vehicle solutions were injected, i.p., 60 min prior to the photochemical insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time for the first platelet aggregate to appear in pial arterioles was significantly delayed (P &lt; 0.001) only by the 100 mg/kg garlic dose and by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of this garlic dose on first aggregate was comparable to that of the 25 and 50 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> doses delayed (P &lt; 0.05) the appearance of first aggregate in venules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arteriolar and venular diameter changes were not different among groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data of this study documented that garlic was capable of delaying platelet aggregation in mouse pial arterioles, in vivo </plain></SENT>
