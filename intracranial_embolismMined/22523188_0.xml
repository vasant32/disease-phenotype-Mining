<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> is regarded as a functional disorder of the brain, numerous studies have reported that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> is closely associated with vascular system abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: We describe a 19-year-old female with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> attacks and typical aura for 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI showed multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesions in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a pseudoaneurysm (1.9 Ã— 1.4 cm) originating from the left vertebral artery was observed on four-vessel angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) were repeatedly observed in the basilar artery using 30-minute transcranial Doppler monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and her typical migrainous symptoms disappeared simultaneously with removal of the pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This case supports the fact that microemboli play a pivotal role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> attacks </plain></SENT>
