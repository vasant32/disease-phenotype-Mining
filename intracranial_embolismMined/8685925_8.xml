<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Filamentous strands attached to the mitral valve are a recently described finding in occasional patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), but the frequency and clinical significance of these strands remain poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to review the prevalence of mitral valve strands in patients undergoing TEE examination and to explore the relation of these strands to cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with native mitral valves referred for clinically indicated TEE over a 2-year period at our institution were evaluated for the presence of mitral valve strands (defined as highly mobile filamentous masses &lt;1 mm thick attached to the atrial surface of mitral leaflets) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 968 study patients, mitral valve strands were identified in 22 individuals (2.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve strands were significantly more common in patients referred for TEE as a result of a recent ischemic cerebrovascular event compared with patients referred for other study indications (6.3% versus 0.3%, respectively; P&lt;.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients &lt; or = 50 years of age with likely cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, 16% were found to have mitral valve strands on TEE examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 9% of these young patients, no other TEE finding associated with cardioembolic risk was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Filamentous strands attached to the mitral valve appear to represent another risk factor for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, particularly in patients &lt; or = 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
