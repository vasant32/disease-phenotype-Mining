<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Areas supplied by the lenticulostriate artery were most markedly damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the water maze test, the <z:chebi fb="10" ids="53706">PVA</z:chebi>-embolized rats took longer to reach the platform than did the nontreated control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To some extent, repeated administrations of TTC-909 (200 ng/kg, IV) overcame this impairment in water maze learning in the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assume that the vasodilating effects of TTC-909 maintain this blood supply to the ischemic area and that TTC-909 prevents the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> around the <z:chebi fb="10" ids="53706">PVA</z:chebi> particles in the arterial capillaries, as a result of antiplatelet aggregative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These two mechanisms are likely to be involved in memory improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TTC-909 may prove effective for treating subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
