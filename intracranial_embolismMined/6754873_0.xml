<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These consisted of perivascular areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> distributed symmetrically in the brain and affecting the white matter predominantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One case in addition had widespread petecchial and ring haemorrhages characteristic of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients sustained second and third degree burns in greater than 50% of the body surface area, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, disturbance in consciousness and multiple episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006543'>cardiorespiratory arrest</z:hpo> prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A toxic metabolic state related to a burn toxin released from the damaged tissue or from <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> action to the tissue in addition to low platelet level is proposed as the major pathogenetic factor in the development of the neurological symptoms and the patients' demise </plain></SENT>
