<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the association of cerebral, caval, and ilio-femoral-popliteal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> has not been described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of the clinical features could be a consequence of the two combined thrombophilic mechanisms and of the continuation of the oral contraceptive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A thrombophilic disorder should be considered in young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
