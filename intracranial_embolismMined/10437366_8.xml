<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) in healthy individuals is estimated to be about 25% and is elevated to 40% patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was considered to be the most sensitive method to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and was regarded as the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler sonography of the middle cerebral artery during contrast injection (c-TCD) has recently been proposed as an alternative method for the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report our experience on 45 patients (age &lt; 55 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) in whom both c-TCD and TEE were performed to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> as a mechanism for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 45 patients (21 women, 24 men, mean age 41.4 years ranging from 17 to 54 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, both standardized TEE and standardized c-TCD were performed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When any <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was found by TEE and/or c-TCD, it was classified as positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If c-TCD was positive but TEE negative, a second TEE was performed and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was found epicritically in 26 patients (57.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First TEE detected <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in 24 cases (sensitivity 92.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Separately performed c-TCD detected <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in 22 cases of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>-positive cases (sensitivity 84.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, c-TCD detected <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in 2 cases, in which the first TEE had been negative, leading to a second TEE which confirmed <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and demonstrated minimal shunt (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TEE detected <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in 4 cases in which first c-TCD was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A second c-TCD confirmed in 2 of these 4 cases a positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neither method revealed false positive results (specifity 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value was 100% in both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The negative predictive value in TEE was 90.5% and in c-TCD was 82.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TEE and c-TCD are not concurrent diagnostic tools to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Both supplement each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>If both methods are used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>-suspected patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> detection rate is higher than when using either method alone </plain></SENT>
