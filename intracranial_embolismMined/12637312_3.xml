<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent reports describe a high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> related to Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) use in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate electrolysis-related changes of blood as a potential cause of thromboembolic complications associated with GDC use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For in vitro observations, 15 GDCs (10 conventional coils and five insulated coils) were experimentally detached under microscopic observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three coils were detached in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, five in human serum, and seven in heparinized human blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For animal experiments, two coils were detached in two canine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> common carotid arteries with systemic heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediately after detachment, the arteries were exposed, and clot formations were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant amounts of gas bubbles were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in vitro observations; more were seen in conventional coils, which required longer detachment times, than in insulated coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gas generation started with the growth of tiny bubbles into larger ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In insulated coils, gas was generated only at the detachment zone, and no difference between saline, serum, and blood environments was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During detachment within heparinized blood, clot formations of 2-3-mm diameter were observed at the detachment zones of insulated coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Animal experiments showed clot formation at the detachment zone, and bubble entrapments around the clots were also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The electrolytic detachment mechanism of the <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coil can generate gas bubbles during the application of electric current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In association with electrothrombosis, this phenomenon may be a potential cause of thromboembolic complications during the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> by use of GDCs </plain></SENT>
