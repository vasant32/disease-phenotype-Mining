<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was certified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in 329 cases and as cerebral haemorrhage in 482 cases, these diagnoses being established in neurological hospitals; the remaining 649 cases had an unspecified type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the diagnosis being made by general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the group with unspecified type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> the blood-group distribution was practically the same as the distribution in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> cases there was an excess of blood-groups A and AB and a deficiency of O and B; in cerebral haemorrhage this situation was reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, these were only trends; the differences were not significant at the 5% level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference did emerge when the A+AB excess in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was contrasted with the O+B excess in haemorrhage, suggesting that this difference might be accounted for the major A subgroup (A1) and, consequently, A1B </plain></SENT>
