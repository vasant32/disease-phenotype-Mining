<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Alterations in local CBF (LCBF) were assessed autoradiographically in the rat at several time points following photochemically induced cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cortical infarction of consistent size and location was produced by irradiating the brain with green light through the intact skull for 20 min following the systemic injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A consistent pattern of altered LCBF was recorded in both ipsilateral and contralateral brain regions over the course of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 30 min, a severely ischemic zone surrounded by regions of cortical hyperemia was apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LCBF was also depressed relative to control values in ipsilateral cortical regions remote from the irradiated area, while contralateral cortical structures were mildly hyperemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By 4 h, the zone of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> had enlarged and its margins were no longer hyperemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral cortical and some subcortical structures demonstrated significantly depressed levels of LCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 5 days, LCBF throughout both ipsilateral and contralateral cortices was depressed compared with control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By 15 days, LCBF had returned to control levels in most brain structures shown histopathologically not to be irreversibly damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The temporal sequence and magnitude of these hemodynamic alterations are consistent with findings in clinical studies in which repeated measurements of CBF have been carried out in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ability to produce a cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> that results in a consistent pattern of altered CBF should facilitate the investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms responsible for these hemodynamic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
