<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present data concerns a ten-year experience of a systematic cardiologic evaluation of patients admitted to the 1st Division of Neurosurgery, Bellaria Hospital, Bologna, Italy, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A two-dimensional echocardiography was carried out in 344 consecutive patients (mean age 53 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> were observed in 92 (28%) out of the 328 cases with technically adequate examination, embologenic lesions in 57 (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 18 cases the cardiac lesion was unknown before the cerebral event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An exercise ECG testing was carried out in 322 patients (mean age 56 years), resulting in abnormal in 69 out of the 258 with adequate examination (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subsequent exercise <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi> myocardial scintigraphy confirmed the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> in 58 cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 24-h Holter monitoring was performed in 65 cases: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were detected in 27 patients (41%), but a correlation with the cerebral event was suggested only in 3 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to our experience patients with recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> should be submitted to the following non-invasive cardiologic screening: (1) exercise ECG testing followed, if abnormal or indeterminant, by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi> myocardial scintigraphy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
