<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of dense SEC with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors and anatomic, hemodynamic, and hemostatic parameters related to specific thromboembolic mechanisms was evaluated by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous echocardiographic contrast was present in 55% of patients and was dense in 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age (odds ratio [OR] 2.4/decade, P &lt;.001), constant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (OR 6.9, P &lt;.001), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2, P &lt;.001), and current tobacco smoking (OR 2.6, P =.04) were independent clinical predictors of dense SEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of clinical, echocardiographic, and hemostatic parameters yielded age as the sole independent clinical predictor of dense SEC (OR 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>4/decade, P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other independent predictors were measures of left atrial/appendage flow dynamics, left atrial size (OR 2.4/cm diameter, M-mode, P &lt;.001), atherosclerotic aortic plaque (OR 2.8, P =.002), and plasma fibrinogen &gt;350 mg/dL (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were similar when SEC of any density was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, SEC occurred in more than half of these patients with prospectively defined nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> but was usually faint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dense SEC was strongly associated with previously reported clinical predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, linking them to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> through atrial stasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diverse pathophysiologic factors including atrial stasis, fibrinogen level, and aortic plaque influence SEC </plain></SENT>
