<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: When the right atrium (RA) cannula is connected to the venous return line of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit, air is often introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Air in the venous cannula may increase cerebral air embolization at initiation of CPB despite the arterial line filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the volume of air present in the venous cannula after cannulation of the RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler quantified emboli as high-intensity transient-signals (HITS) in both middle-cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) at the beginning of CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After RA cannulation, the air column in the venous line was measured and the total volume calculated using the known lumen diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CPB <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was defined as the instant when the CPB machine started moving the patient's blood from the RA into the venous reservoir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Starting from CPB <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, HITS were counted: (a) until completion of the first minute on CPB (1-min count) and (b) until aortic cross clamping (pre-clamping count) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 135 patients during coronary artery bypass surgery operated on by 10 cardiac surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HITS during <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CPB were detected in 95% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median counts were 10 HITS (25th, 75th percentiles: 3, 26) at 1-min and 21 HITS (8, 51) during pre-clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between the volume of air in the venous cannula and the HITS counts (r=0.524, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Absence of retained air was associated with lower HITS counts [3 HITS (1, 11)] compared with any amount of air [13 HITS (4, 29), p=0.002)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The volume of air in the venous cannula, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> mean blood flow velocity and the pre-clamping time were the only independent predictors of the pre-clamping HITS counts (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Air in the venous cannula can result in HITS in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Minimizing the volume of air introduced into the venous cannula after cannulation of the RA can decrease cerebral air embolization at the beginning of CPB </plain></SENT>
