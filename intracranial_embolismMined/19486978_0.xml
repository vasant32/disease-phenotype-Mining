<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic cerebral microembolization can be detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and has been associated with increased risk of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence in patients with recently symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we sought to determine whether spontaneous microembolization was associated with neutrophil count in patients with recently symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We continuously monitored Transcranial Doppler (TCD) spectra of middle cerebral artery blood flow ipsilateral to recently symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in 60 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) were diagnosed by experienced observers blinded to leukocyte count and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in 20 (33.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microembolization was associated with higher neutrophil counts (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in monocyte count and lymphocyte count between patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and patients without <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microembolization remained strongly associated with neutrophil count in multivariable analysis (p=0.003) whereas the association with hs-CRP was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil count was associated with microembolization in patients with recently symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that neutrophils may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> related to carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
