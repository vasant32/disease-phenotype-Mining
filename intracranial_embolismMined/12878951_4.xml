<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> represents one of the most serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the value of microembolic signals in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> for individual patients and distinctive left ventricular assist device periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients (14 male) aged 23-57 years supported with the Novacor N100 left ventricular assist device were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were on effective anticoagulation, 12 patients additionally received antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unilateral detection of microembolic signals was performed once weekly by insonation of the middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler sonography for 30 minutes duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence of clinically manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> was based on regular questionnaires, clinical examinations, and results of diagnostic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a cumulative follow-up of 3876 left ventricular assist device days, 44 thromboembolic complications occurred (incidence, 1.1%) in 15 out of 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 360 transcranial Doppler sonography monitorings (range, 5-34 per patient) were performed with an overall microembolic signals prevalence of 35.3% and a microembolic signal mean of 2.3 +/- 9.2 per examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a highly significant correlation between the individual microembolic signal activity and the respective incidence of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (r = 0.61-0.9; P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with additional antiplatelet treatment had significantly less thromboembolic complications (0.7%) and lower microembolic signal prevalence (18.3%) than those without (2.8% and 65.4%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Individual patients and left ventricular assist device months with clinical thromboembolization could be identified using the microembolic signal activity with moderate positive (0.37-0.7) and high negative predictive values (0.82-1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The amount of microembolic signals, serially detected in patients with the Novacor left ventricular assist device, is significantly associated with their incidence of embolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The high negative predictive value of microembolic signals enables to identify those patients and left ventricular assist device periods with particularly low risk of clinical thromboembolization </plain></SENT>
