<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) is currently being assessed for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In comparison with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), there is evidence of an increased risk of cerebral microembolism during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have sought evidence of any neuropsychological sequelae of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and compared it with CEA to demonstrate the relative safety of the 2 treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The neuropsychological outcomes after CEA and <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> were compared in 2 matched groups of patients with severe symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, 96% of whom had been randomized in the Carotid and Vertebral Artery Transluminal Angioplasty Study (CAVATAS), at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler insonation of the middle cerebral artery was used to measure cerebral reactivity in response to carbon dioxide inhalation before treatment and then to detect microembolization of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere and measure changes in blood flow velocity during the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The performance on a neuropsychological test battery administered before, 6 weeks after, and 6 months after the procedure was compared in 20 patients undergoing <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and 26 having CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6 weeks, 5 patients in each group showed a similar decline in neuropsychological performance; global measures showed no significant difference between the 2 procedures, despite a significantly higher incidence of microemboli during <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both groups showed a marked reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide some reassurance that <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> is not associated with greater cerebral complications than CEA, despite the higher embolic load recorded by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography during angioplasty </plain></SENT>
