<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report intermediate results of a pilot study in which the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> abciximab was given to patients during percutaneous carotid stenting for recurrent internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to prevent procedure-related cerebral embolic events and decrease the incidence of recurrent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen patients (9 women; mean age 66.5 years, range 39-78) with severe ICA recurrent stenosis (&gt;80%) underwent balloon angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before the procedure, abciximab was administered intravenously as a bolus (0.25 mg/kg) followed by a 12-hour continuous infusion (10 microg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients received stents (14 Wallstent and 1 Strecker); 1 vessel was dilated with only 50% improvement in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two stented arteries had residual stenosis (&lt;30%) but satisfactory <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter was achieved in the remaining 13 (81%) arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no neurological ischemic events during or following the procedure, nor were there any <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or peripheral vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duplex surveillance studies up to 12 months revealed no significant recurrent stenosis in the treated vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The administration of abciximab in conjunction with percutaneous revascularization procedures for postsurgical carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> may reduce cerebral ischemic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may also attenuate restenosis in the treated artery </plain></SENT>
