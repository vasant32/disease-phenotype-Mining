<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">High-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) levels are inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence, suggesting a protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a rat model, we tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> exerts direct vasculo-/neuroprotective effects when administered during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After embolic occlusion, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly treated intravenously with purified <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> versus saline immediately (2, 10 mg/kg) or 3 or 5 hours (10 mg/kg) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were assessed blindly 24 hours later by evaluating neurological deficit score and measuring the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and blood-brain barrier breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protease activities and neutrophil infiltration were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> injection immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (10 mg/kg) reduced by 68% the mortality at 24 hours (P=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> administration immediately or at 3 or 5 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> also reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 74%, 68%, and 70.7%, respectively (P=0.0003, P=0.011, and P=0.019; n=17 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit at 24 hours in the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-treated group was decreased versus the saline-treated group (P=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>-induced blood-brain barrier breakdown was significantly reduced in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-treated rats versus controls (P=0.0045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were associated with decreased neutrophil recruitment in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area (P=0.0027) accompanied by reduced matrix metalloproteinase gelatinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining showed that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> was associated with endothelial and glial cells, and also that intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 expression was decreased in vessels within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> is neuroprotective when performed up to 5 hours after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This effect may be attributed to the ability of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> to protect the blood-brain barrier and limit neutrophil recruitment </plain></SENT>
