<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If therapy is initiated in good time, development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> may be at least partially prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic treatment was performed in 14 patients at the Wagner-Jauregg Hospital within a period of one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urokinase was given locally, while rtPA was applied locally and/or systemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>4 patients had an occlusion of the internal carotid artery, 6 an occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, and 4 an occlusion of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization was achieved in 6 patients, partial recanalization in 4, and no recanalization in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neurological outcome of the cases with complete recanalization was good with the exception of one patients who died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial recanalization resulted in a fair outcome in 2 patients, while the other 2 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3 out of the 4 patients in whom no recanalization was achieved died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that this form of therapy may considerably improve the natural history of the disease, provided recanalization is achieved in good time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They encourage us to continue this form of therapy and to work at improving the therapeutic criteria </plain></SENT>
