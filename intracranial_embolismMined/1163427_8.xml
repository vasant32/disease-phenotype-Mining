<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The over-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> incidence of cardiac and peripheral vascular complications was 3.13 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cardiac complications included four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillations</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral vascular complications included three femoral artery thromboses, two peripheral emboli, and one probable cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cardiac complications was not significantly different from that reported in the literature with the Sones technique and local arterial complications were significantly lower than those reported with the Sones technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The causes of individual complications are analyzed and measures to minimize these complications are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Judkins technique is a simple, reliable, quick, and safe method of selective coronary arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of complications can be kept at an acceptably low level by stringent observation of every minor detail of the technique </plain></SENT>
