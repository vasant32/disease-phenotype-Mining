<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral perfusion and tissue densities were measured by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-contrasted CT scanning and compared by cross-sectional designs among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (Group C, n = 44), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (Group N, n = 20), patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> (Group L, n = 31) and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> associated with cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (Group E, n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Group E, remaining cortical and subcortical gray and white matter perfusion were reduced compared to Groups C and N (p = 0.01), but did not differ from Group L, who had similar profiles of risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Group E, perfusion was reduced within the thalamus ipsilateral to cortical infarctions (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in remaining tissue densities between Groups E and L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that reduced cerebral perfusion in noninfarcted regions among patients with cardiogenic emboli appears to be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of small cerebral vessels in a similar manner to patients with lacunes, but thalamo-cortical disconnections also contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
