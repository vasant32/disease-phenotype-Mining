<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the timing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> after emboli-protected carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Predominantly clinically silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> has been observed in up to 50% of patients undergoing emboli-protected CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The timing and location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> has not been sufficiently elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 58 patients (69.6 +/- 8.3 years) who underwent 59 procedures, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) was performed before the intervention and at 2 time points (t(1) and t(2)) after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patient showed recent cerebral injury before CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At t(1) = 3.5 +/- 1.8 h, new ischemic foci, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> located in the ipsilateral hemisphere, were observed in 12 of 59 DWMRI studies (20.3%, 95% confidence interval: 11.0% to 32.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At t(2) = 18.0 +/- 3.1 h, 7 more DWMRI scans showed recent ischemic foci, and 3 scans in patients with positive scans at t(1) showed additional foci, for a total of 10 scans (17.0%, 95% confidence interval: 8.4% to 29.0%) documenting late <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 4 of these (40%), ischemic foci were located contralaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was not associated with overt neurological sequelae out to 30 days in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> occurring between 3.5 and 18 h after emboli-protected CAS was 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may occur with equal likelihood in either hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preventive measures to possibly reduce the incidence of cerebral embolization should focus not only on the target lesion, but also on the access vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients should be monitored and DWMRI delayed for at least 18 h after the intervention </plain></SENT>
