<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: an increase in mean platelet volume and a decrease in platelet total have been reported following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011877'>increased mean platelet volume</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> has been shown to be predictive of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: given the established seasonal variation in morbidity and mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and various risk factors for the disease, we explored the seasonal variation in mean platelet volume and platelet total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: we assessed levels of platelet count, platelet volume, fibrinogen, factor VII, core body and ambient temperatures in 54 healthy community dwelling elderly volunteers over a period of 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used cosinor rhythmometry to quantify and compare the seasonal rhythms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: we found significant seasonal variation in fibrinogen, mean platelet volume and core body temperature <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which peaked synchronously in May/June, in a year with an atypically mild winter and hot summer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet total and factor VII did not exhibit a seasonal rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: we conclude that the synchrony between peak size of platelets and peak level of fibrinogen will significantly increase the likelihood of thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide further evidence of a seasonal pro-thrombotic state, which has a complex relationship with temperature </plain></SENT>
