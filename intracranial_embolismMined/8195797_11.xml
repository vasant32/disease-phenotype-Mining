<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a validation study of a new technique for detecting circulating pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Theoretically one would expect solid emboli to be detectable as high intensity signals on the Doppler waveform, and such signals have been reported in humans with potential embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, platelet aggregates and atheroma) were introduced into the proximal carotid artery of an in vivo sheep model, and their passage detected in the cerebral circulation using Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of 74 emboli, with a maximum dimension as small as 0.24 mm, were detected as short duration high intensity signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Smaller pathological emboli could not be made but glass microspheres as small as 5-20 micron resulted in high intensity signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation was found between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> size and relative intensity increase of the embolic signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation was also found between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> size and duration of embolic signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that detection of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> is possible in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This technique may allow selection of patients at particularly high risk of cerebral embolisation so that they can be given specific prophylactic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the Doppler signal may give information on the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, although using current signal analysis it is impossible to distinguish between the signals produced by say a larger platelet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> or a smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
