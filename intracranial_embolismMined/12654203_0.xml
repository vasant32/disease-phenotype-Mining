<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients with 21 atherosclerotic stenoses of the carotid or vertebral artery underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and/or stenting with brain protection device (filterwire or angioguard) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical results were summarized and the indispensability and feasibility of the device was discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With the aid of brain protection device, endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and (or) stenting were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with 21 stenoses of the carotid or vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interventional manipulation was successful and no complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Brain protection device is helpful to decrease the embolic complication caused by atherosclerotic plaque and thromboembolus and to increase the security of interventional therapy, during the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and/or stenting of stenosis of the carotid or vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
