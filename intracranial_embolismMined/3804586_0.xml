<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>Behavioral disturbances</z:hpo>, presenting in twenty patients, were followed by 9.6 BD, 13.8 E, and 5.3 fatal events per 100 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Embolic events, presenting in thirty-three patients, were followed by 1.9 BD, 8.4 E, and 3.4 fatal events per 100 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients presenting with neither event subsequently had 2.7 BD, 7.3 E, and 3.6 fatal events per 100 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that a behavioral disturbance in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> is a predictive of an embolic event as is an embolic event itself </plain></SENT>
