<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the short-term functional outcomes of 134 patients diagnosed with cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> due to nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> during the period of May 2006 to August 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional state was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) on admission and at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A good functional outcome (mRS â‰¤2) at discharge was significantly associated with low mRS on admission (OR: 0.07; CI: 0.03-0.18; p&lt;0.001), and a low C-reactive protein (CRP) level (OR: 0.19; CI: 0.04-0.89; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional improvement during admission was positively associated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (OR: 2.74; CI: 1.11-6.76; p&lt;0.05), whereas high diastolic blood pressure (OR: 0.95; CI: 0.90-0.99; p&lt;0.05) and a high blood sugar level (OR: 0.98; CI: 0.97-0.99; p&lt;0.05) on admission were inversely associated with functional improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no relationship existed between mRS on admission and functional improvement during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a good functional state at discharge was associated with a good functional state on admission as well as a low serum CRP level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, functional improvement was associated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, low diastolic blood pressure, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">low blood sugar</z:e> level on admission </plain></SENT>
