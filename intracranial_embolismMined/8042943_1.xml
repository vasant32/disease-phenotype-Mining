<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strategies to reduce its incidence require a knowledge of the underlying pathology and aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the incidence, pathology and aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> complicating CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective review of clinical, operative and cranial CT scan findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> complicating CPB procedures in our institution over an 18 month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one (1.6%, 95% CI 0.9-2.3%) cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were identified from 1336 CPB procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cranial CT scan, performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient, was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in three patients or consistent with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of haemorrhagic infarction or intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was difficult to differentiate embolic and borderzone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After considering the clinical, operative and CT scan features together, 12 (57%, 95% CI 36-78%) of the cases were felt to be embolic in origin and nine (43%, 95% CI 22-64%) due to hypoperfusion in a borderzone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains an important complication of CPB procedures with an incidence in our series of 1.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pathologic type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is predominantly ischaemic in nature due to either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> or borderzone infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients undergoing CPB should be targeted primarily at these two mechanisms </plain></SENT>
