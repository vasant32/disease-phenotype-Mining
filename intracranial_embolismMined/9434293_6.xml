<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper we describe a rapid revascularization therapy using liquid jets generated by the interaction of gas bubbles with shock waves, which impact on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interaction of a shock wave with a gas bubble attached to an artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> which was inserted into a tube model of a cerebral artery was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The shock wave was generated by detonating a microexplosive pellet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overpressure of the shock wave was 3.0 +/- 0.6 MPa (n = 7) and 12.7 +/- 0.4 MPa (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial air bubble radii were varied from 0.87 mm to 2.18 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subsequent collapse of the bubble was photographed using a high-speed framing camera, and the liquid jet penetrating into the artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was visualized using x-ray photography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The penetration depth of the liquid jet increased with increasing bubble size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was an optimal separation distance between the bubble and the shock wave source to obtain the maximum penetration depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Liquid jets have the potential to penetrate through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in as little as a few microseconds, and with very efficient ablation </plain></SENT>
