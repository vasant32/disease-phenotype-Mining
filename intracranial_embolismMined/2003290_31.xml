<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emboli introduced into the rabbit aorta via the left renal artery consisted of clotted whole blood, platelets, atheromatous material, fat, or air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ultrasound examination was carried out continuously during the studies using a multifrequency transcranial Doppler apparatus with a 2-MHz probe, a sample volume of 15 mm, at a depth of 15 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intensity of the Doppler spectrum was measured and displayed as a 15-shade color scale, each shade representing a 3-dB difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the aorta at the site of the ultrasound examination was similar to the diameter of the middle cerebral artery in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 125 emboli introduced were clearly detected because they caused a Doppler signal at least 15 dB greater than that of the surrounding blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that the potential for emboli detection using Doppler ultrasound in the clinical situation is now considerable </plain></SENT>
