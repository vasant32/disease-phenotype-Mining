<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To seek evidence of potential embolic sources or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms in patients who, on chance observation, had several apparently recent small subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and multiple hyperintense subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> visible on DWI were identified prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed clinical and radiological assessments were done independently and blinded to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 10 patients with multiple hyperintense subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on DWI, a definite embolic source was identified in only one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients were hypertensive and smoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DWI appearance suggested that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> had occurred within several weeks rather than at exactly the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients also had significant white matter hyperintensities and four had microhaemorrhages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Embolic sources were not identified in most patients but they did have systemic vascular risk factors and brain imaging features of "small vessel disease." A more generalised intrinsic process affecting many small cerebral vessels contemporaneously could explain multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> small subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>White matter hyperintensities, microhaemorrhages, and multiple small subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may share a common pathophysiological mechanism such as a diffuse cerebral microvascular abnormality which requires further exploration </plain></SENT>
