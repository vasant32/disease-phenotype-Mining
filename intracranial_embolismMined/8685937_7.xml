<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There has been concern regarding the reproducibility of the detection of embolic signals, particularly in patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in whom the signals are of low intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No published studies have examined inter-center agreement in reporting specific embolic signals or the factors responsible for any lack of agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined reproducibility between two centers in which widely differing proportions of embolic signals have previously been reported in patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Recordings from the middle cerebral artery of eight patients with ipsilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in whom embolic signals had been detected during a previously study were independently examined by three experienced observers in one center and by one experienced observer in another center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated agreement within and between centers by estimating the probability that one observer would identify a specific embolic signal if other observers had identified it (a probability of 1 indicates complete agreement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The influence of different characteristics of the embolic signal on the probability of its detection as an embolic signal was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A high level of agreement in the identification of specific embolic signals was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was similar between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> observers (.90), between the three observers in one center (.89), and between observers in the two different centers (.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probability of detection was independently related to the relative intensity of the embolic signal (P&lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was less (although significantly) independently related to the position of the embolic signal in the cardiac cycle (P=.02), with signals in systole being more reliably detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no independent relationship between the probability of detection and either the duration of the embolic signal or the velocity at the maximum intensity increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of threshold intensity as a criterion for embolic signal detection increased interobserver agreement but reduced the sensitivity in detecting signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high level of interobserver agreement suggests that the technique is sufficiently reproducible for clinical use </plain></SENT>
