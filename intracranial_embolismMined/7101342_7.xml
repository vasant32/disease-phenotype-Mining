<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper contains an analysis of 135 cases in which numbness, either episodic or persistent, involved one side of the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the patients were candidates for the diagnosis of pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> which is usually the result of an occlusive cerebrovascular lesion involving the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases are divided into three main categories, pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, and atypical cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical features described in an earlier paper have been confirmed for the most part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A major limitation is the paucity of pathological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lack of reliable criteria for the recognition of migrainous <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesias</z:hpo> has probably resulted in the inadvertent inclusion of some such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some other conditions, hemidysesthesia and cervical disc, which have had to be considered in the differential diagnosis have been included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases of occlusive disease of the posterior cerebral internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries have been analyzed for patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesias</z:hpo> which may serve to distinguish cortical lesions from thalamic </plain></SENT>
