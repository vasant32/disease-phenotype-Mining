<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Maintenance of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation in the brain is of major importance for patient outcome in various clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors assessed local autoregulation after "asymptomatic" cortical vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In Wistar rats, a single cortical vein was occluded photochemically by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and fiberoptic illumination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rats with bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was lowered in 5-mm Hg increments down to 40 mm Hg by using hypobaric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local CBF at each pressure level was assessed by performing laser Doppler (LD) scanning at 25 (5 x 5) locations within bilateral cranial windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this manner, the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LLA was 60 mm Hg in both right and left hemispheres in Group A (five rats), in which the animals received illumination without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and had no venous occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 rats that underwent vein occlusion, three developed severe reductions in local CBF and/or a growing venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and were distinguished as Group C (symptomatic; three rats); from previous work we know that those animals are bound to experience venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining rats formed Group B (asymptomatic; eight rats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this group the LLA remained at 60 mm Hg in the left hemisphere without occlusion, whereas, in the right cortex with the occluded vein, the LLA was found to be 65 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Below a carotid stump pressure of 25 mm Hg regional CBF in the affected hemisphere dropped more abruptly to a possibly ischemic range than that in the opposite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that cerebral venous circulation disorders are manifested via additional pathways, that is, from a partially impaired local autoregulation in the vicinity of the occluded vein, even under conditions in which the vein occlusion itself does not cause brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Care should be taken in the control of blood pressure in patients with this pathological condition </plain></SENT>
