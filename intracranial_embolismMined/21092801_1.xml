<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on data from 206 consecutive patients (125 male; median age, 67 years; range, 20-87 years) who had a trifurcated graft used for aortic arch replacement between September 1999 and September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four patients (35.9%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection, 68 patients (33.0%) had atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and 39 patients (18.9%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-one patients (44.2%) had undergone previous cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An elephant trunk was placed in 190 patients (92.2%) and completed in 101 patients (53.1%), with an interval of less than 365 days between stages in 94 of 101 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 6.8% (14/206) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adverse outcome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within the first year postoperatively) occurred in 27.7% of patients (57/206; 50 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>/7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 152 1-year survivors, the annual rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were 0.85% and 1.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 6 years, 75% of patients were still alive, compared with 92% in a matched New York State control population (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up computed tomography scans (189 studies in 176/206 patients [85.4%]) revealed 100% patency of the trifurcated graft limbs at a mean of 2.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic arch replacement using a trifurcated graft is highly durable, with excellent patency in the branch grafts, and is associated with a low incidence of cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the long-term outcome in these patients is compromised by extensive comorbidities </plain></SENT>
