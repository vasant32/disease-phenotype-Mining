<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the relationship of the syringe bore, injection rate, and HITS created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Syringes (10 mL) with a male luer-lock connection (Large Bore) and Abboject 'jet syringes' with a 20 GA needle and male luer-lock connector (Small Bore) were filled with 10 mL of 0.9 N saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A perfusionist was randomly assigned a set of four similar syringes followed by the other syringe bore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each of the four syringes was injected into an in vitro saline-primed cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) system over 5, 10, 15, or 20 sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen randomizations of small and large bore syringes were completed at the four injection times (128 injections) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HITS in the CPB arterial line were detected with transcranial Doppler (TCD) probes, were recorded for the 2 min following the injection, and were counted independently off-line by two reviewers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The use of a large bore syringe compared to a small bore syringe created significantly fewer HITS (29 +/- 6 versus 145 +/- 17 [mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>], p&lt;0.001) introduced into the CPB arterial line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Injection over a longer time produced significantly fewer HITS than shorter injection times (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significantly fewer HITS are introduced into the CPB system by using standard syringes and slower injection time </plain></SENT>
