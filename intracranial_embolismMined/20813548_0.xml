<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to develop decision guides to predict the presence of a high-risk source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and to predict a change in management following transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in subjects who present with a first cerebral ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective review of subjects age ≥18 years who underwent TEE after a first ischemic event and were admitted to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> service between 2004 and 2007 (n = 287) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A high-risk source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and a change in clinical management (including medication changes or subsequent testing) were analyzed as separate endpoints, using multivariate techniques and receiver operating characteristic curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that 14.3% of the subjects had a high-risk source, and an additional 61.3% had a potential (or low-risk) source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increasing age and no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were independently associated with a high-risk source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TEE would be recommended for nondiabetic individuals age ≥66 years (sensitivity, 68%; specificity, 76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve (AUC) for detecting a high-risk source was 0.773 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TEE results changed medications or clinical management in 30.3% of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current smokers were less likely to undergo a change in management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The AUC was uninformative (0.56) for predicting changes in management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects presenting with a first ischemic event age ≥66 years may benefit from TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although changes in management occurred in at least 30% of our cohort, no factors that predicted a change in management better than chance alone could be identified </plain></SENT>
