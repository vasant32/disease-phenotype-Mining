<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors describe the clinical, radiological, and pathological findings of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> with irregular configurations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to ruptured irregularly shaped <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preoperative radiological findings in these cases were compared with the pathological and operative findings of endovascular or open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> exhibited delayed opacification and delayed washout of contrast medium from the irregularly shaped portion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> on digital subtraction angiography and/or helical computerized tomography scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endovascular embolization with <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coils was attempted in the first four patients who underwent treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three of these patients the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> ruptured again during the endovascular procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the fourth patient an intraaneurysm <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was observed during the procedure and clipping was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subsequent four patients, three underwent clipping without complication and one underwent partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> embolization because of poor general status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> adjacent to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> dome was observed in the patients who underwent open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination of the operative specimens revealed a pseudoaneurysm-like cavity in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> that was adherent to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ruptured irregularly shaped <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may be accompanied by fragile pseudoaneurysm-like cavities located at the rupture point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> have a high risk of repeated rupture during an endovascular procedure, advancing microinstruments to the weaker portion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> should be avoided </plain></SENT>
