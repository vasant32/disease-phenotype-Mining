<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IMZ SPECT images obtained three hours after administration of the tracer were compared with the images of cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies in 206 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In regions with decreased CBF, the uptake of IMZ was relatively preserved in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in comparison with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, and in those with perforator branch infarction in comparison with cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The uptake of IMZ decreased as a function of both the severity of the decrease in the CBF and the duration of illness in regions with a significantly decreased perfusion reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that decreased IMZ binding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> reflects the neuronal damage caused by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, the cortical uptake of IMZ was relatively well-preserved in regions with decreased CBF, and the decrease in the uptake of IMZ was more profound as a function of the decrease in the CBF, especially in cases of putaminal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results also suggest that the decreased cortical CBF is a remote effect caused by a neuronal disconnection, and neuronal damage may occur in regions with severely impaired CBF </plain></SENT>
