<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Known platelet <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> would predict that heparinization during this early period would be useful to allow a fibrin-free platelet monolayer to form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After systemic heparinization (145 mu/kg) of the experimental animals, 42 endarterectomies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow was then resumed for specific periods of time, and the vessels were prepared for scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1 vessels (from the unheparinized control group) revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> formation after 10 minutes of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 2 vessels revealed the progressive formation of a fibrin-free platelet monolayer after 2, 5, or 10 minutes of blood flow resumption under systemic heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 3 arteries, harvested at 10 minutes, underwent immediate (within 1 to 2 minutes after resumption of flow) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> reversal with protamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi>, and demonstrated numerous patches of fibrin covering the platelet monolayer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group 4 arteries, studied after 3 hours of blood flow, also underwent immediate <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of these seven specimens had clumps of fibrin overlying the platelet monolayer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Group 5 vessels had <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> reversal at 10 minutes, and demonstrated no fibrin overlying the platelet monolayer after 3 hours of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the formation of a fibrin-free platelet monolayer over the endarterectomized vessel wall within 10 minutes of resumption of flow under systemic heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> may safely be reversed following a carotid endarterectomy if one awaits the initial critical 10 minutes of blood flow </plain></SENT>
