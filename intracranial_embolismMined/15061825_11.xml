<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought prospectively <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> causes, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> topography, and clinical findings of 137 patients with superficial <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with or without mesencephalic/thalamic involvement, representing 11% of patients with posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed patients by subdividing into three subgroups; (1). cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (CI) group; (2). cortical and deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (CDI) (thalamic and/or mesencephalic involvement) group; (3). bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (BI) group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presumed causes of infarction were intrinsic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> disease in 33 patients (26%), proximal large-artery disease (PLAD) in 33 (24%), cardioembolism in 23 (17%), co-existence of PLAD and cardioembolism in 7 (5%), vertebral or basilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> in 8 (6%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
