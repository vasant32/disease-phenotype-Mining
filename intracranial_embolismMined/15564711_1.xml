<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed no organic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed clear direct continuity between a hypertrophied anterolateral papillary muscle and the anterior mitral leaflet, and the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract (LVOT) was narrowed by the presence of an accessory papillary muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The LVOT obstruction caused an intra-LV pressure overload that resulted in LV concentric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF), was thought to have caused a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve replacement (MVR), septal myectomy, and myectomy of the abnormal papillary muscle were performed, and complete release of the LVOT obstruction was accomplished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anomalous insertion of papillary muscle is a rare cause of LVOT obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was useful in identifying the papillary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235947" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">muscle malformation</z:e>, and surgery was completely curative </plain></SENT>
