<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was induced in rats by photothrombosis after hematogenous macrophages were depleted by means of liposomes containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51370">dichloromethylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29262">diphosphonate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phagocytic activation of microglia and macrophages was monitored by immunocytochemistry with the antibody ED1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both macrophage-depleted rats and controls, ED1+ phagocytes bordered the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to the same extent at day 3 after photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, at day 6 after photothrombosis ED1+ phagocytes in control rats greatly outnumbered those in macrophage-depleted rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the use of the antibody Ox42 directed against the CR3 receptor on the surface of microglia, it was possible to selectively document the transition of resident microglia into stellate and ameboid phagocytic microglia during the first 6 days after photothrombosis in the absence of bloodborne macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The initial phagocytic response after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> is an intrinsic property of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system mainly performed by resident microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of hematogenous macrophages are recruited secondarily to participate in the removal of necrotic tissue </plain></SENT>
