<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nineteen patients with Ewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> of bone, each younger than 3 years of age at the time of initial presentation, are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These children represent an unusually young age group for documented Ewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> and represent 2.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients registered in the Intergroup Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>Sarcoma</z:hpo> Study (IESS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The diagnosis was made on combined histologic, clinical, and radiographic grounds and was supported by immunohistochemistry in nine patients and electron microscopic study in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies showed no staining against neuro-specific enolase, chromogranin, or S-100 in any patients, and in only one in nine patients were results of such studies focally positive against Leu-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most marked clinical variation between this group of infants and the general IESS patient population was a striking predominance of female patients in the younger age group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward more rib, pelvis, and proximal long <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005967" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone tumors</z:e> in the infants and toddlers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate of the infants was 56%, almost identical to the survival rates of the older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the infants who died of disease did so within 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extended follow-up as long as 9.9 years has found no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most significant late complications of therapy included cardiotoxicity with cerebral embolization from the heart and a short lower limb secondary to radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> must be considered in the differential diagnosis of small cell, round cell, and blue cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in bone, even in infants and toddlers </plain></SENT>
