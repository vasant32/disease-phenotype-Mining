<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After good initial progress, the patient had to be reoperated on the 12th postoperative day for sternal disunion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was followed rapidly by progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the aortic prosthesis demonstrated by repeated Doppler echocardiographic examination </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome was favourable after a regressive cerebral embolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the value of Doppler echocardiographic examination in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis may constitute an alternative to reoperation when the operative risk is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of thrombolysis may not be as great as some believe </plain></SENT>
