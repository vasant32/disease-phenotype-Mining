<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that cerebral fat microembolism takes place during surgery for hip or knee replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the occurrence of cerebral microembolism, solid or gas, during a standard procedure of hip fracture fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective study of patients who underwent urgent surgery with a dynamic hip screw for hip fracture fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During surgery, patients were monitored with transcranial Doppler for detection of microemboli from right and left middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included in the study; their median age was 82 yr (range, 51-97 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In nine (41%) patients, high intensity transient signals were recorded, indicating microemboli passage in the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nine patients had signals of both solid and gas emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these nine patients had a postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of cerebral microemboli during urgent surgery for hip fracture fixation is considerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is not confined to hip or knee replacement surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications of this finding require further investigation </plain></SENT>
