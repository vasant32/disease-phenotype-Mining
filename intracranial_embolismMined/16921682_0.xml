<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravascular mobilization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> subsequent to CPB has been implicated in some of its recognized pathophysiologies, particularly with regard to cerebral embolic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether fat mobilization is still a real issue in modern perfusion practice and to determine whether off pump coronary artery bypass techniques minimize this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients undergoing routine elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1 patients underwent off pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) procedures, and group 2 underwent CABG supported with CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken from the CPB patients at the beginning, middle, and end of the procedure, from the suction line, from the arterial line, and from the venous line for measurement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Samples were taken at corresponding time-points from the OPCAB patients for similar measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fat emboli</z:e> were counted manually using Oil red O staining and light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> were sized using calibrated microspheres as a visual size contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> were observed in any of the blood samples taken from the OPCAB patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples taken during CPB from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The count was highest in the suction system and lowest in the venous blood and tended to increase during CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was an absence of large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> in the venous blood, which tends to indicate that the larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> lodge in the microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>OPCAB surgery eliminates the risk of fat embolization in patients undergoing coronary revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The suction system is the major source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> during CPB, and despite the multiple filtration components of the CPB system, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fat emboli</z:e> of various and significant sizes do reach the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Fat embolization remains a risk in routine elective CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cardiotomy suction should be eliminated where possible </plain></SENT>
