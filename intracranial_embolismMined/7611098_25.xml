<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the prevalence of thoracic aorta ulcerated plaques (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> &gt; or = 2 mm in both depth and width) in three age-matched groups undergoing multiplane TEE: group 1, 23 patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>; group 2, 26 patients with known-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>; and group 3, 57 control patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TEEs were interpreted in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ulcerated plaques were found in 9 (39%) group 1 patients but in only 2 (8%) group 2 patients and in only 4 (7%) group 3 patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an association between advancing age and the presence of ulcerated plaques (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ulcerated atherosclerotic plaques in the thoracic aorta are associated with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and should be considered a potential source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
