<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The number of microemboli as measured by Doppler ultrasound during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be reduced by positioning the arterial cannula into the aorta descendens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate whether this alternative aortic cannulation procedure leads to better neuropsychologic outcome early after surgery along with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients with elective CABG were randomized to either using a short aorta ascendens cannula or an elongated cannula placed in the aorta descendens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were tested by seven neuropsychologic tests preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection could be performed by transcranial Doppler in 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychologic tests could be repeated serially until the 9th postoperative day in 54 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient groups did not differ in terms of preoperative psychometric performance and of the surgical characteristics except cannula positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were analyzed by a blinded assessor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neuropsychologic test scores showed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individual patients a transient decline with subsequent recovery, but did not differ significantly between the groups except for the letter cancellation test at discharge favoring the patients with the longer cannula (102.3 +/- 11.6 vs. 94.5 +/- 11.5 mean +/- SD; p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup who had Doppler sonography, neuropsychologic test scores did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, microembolic signals were markedly reduced in patients with the elongated cannula (median 174.5 vs. 413.0; p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Though reducing brain microembolism, use of an elongated aortic cannula does not appear to influence overall cognitive performance early after CABG in this pilot study </plain></SENT>
