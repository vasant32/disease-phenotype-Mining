<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early patient selection and establishment of the optimum therapeutic modality are important to improve the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early clinical, computed tomography (CT), and angiographic characteristics were analysed to identify patients with malignant infarction and external and internal decompression was performed, with unco-parahippocampectomy if needed, and the outcomes were compared with those of conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four of 55 patients admitted with large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> due to embolism showed rapid clinical deterioration due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These 34 patients were treated under a diagnosis of malignant infarction by decompressive surgical treatment (19 cases) or conservative treatment (15 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT showed significantly higher infarction volume in patients with malignant infarction (288 +/- 62 cm3) compared to patients with non-malignant infarction (200 + 57 cm3, P &lt; 0.001) and angiography showed a higher incidence of recanalization of the occluded vessels in patients with malignant infarction (58%) compared to patients with non-malignant infarction (15%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discriminant analysis revealed that an infarction volume of more than 240 cm3 was predictive of malignant infarction with 76.4% accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basic clinical characteristics on admission and deterioration were not statistically different between the surgically treated and conservatively treated groups of patients with malignant infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The shift of midline structures was significantly improved (14 +/- 3.5 to 10 +/- 4.7 mm) after surgical treatment (P &lt; 0.05). compared to deterioration (12 +/- 5.8 to 15 +/- 4.5 mm) after conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mortality was 67% in the conservative group and 16% in the surgical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment significantly improved the mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale score (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the mean Barthel Index scores of the survivors were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of more than 240 cm3 on CT and angiographic recanalization of the occluded artery are predictors of fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> after massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
