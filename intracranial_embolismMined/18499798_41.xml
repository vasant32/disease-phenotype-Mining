<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Data from recent reports have indicated that mechanical thrombectomy may have potential as a treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and performance of the Penumbra System (PS): a novel mechanical device designed to reduce clot burden in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to large-vessel occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, single arm, independently monitored and core laboratory adjudicated trial enrolled subjects with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic deficit consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, presenting within 8 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and an angiographically verified occlusion (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> [TIMI] grade 0 or 1) of a treatable intracranial vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was revascularization of the target vessel to TIMI grade 2 or 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were the proportion of subjects who achieved a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 2 or less or a 4-point improvement on the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score at 30-day follow-up, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects were enrolled, and 21 target vessels were treated in 20 subjects by the PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, mean age was 60 years, mean mRS score was 4.6, and mean NIHSS score was 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postprocedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 of the treated vessels (100%) were successfully revascularized by the PS to TIMI 2 or 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 30-day follow-up, 9 subjects (45%) had a 4-point or more NIHSS improvement or an mRS of 2 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality rate was 45% (9 of 20), which is lower than expected in this severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort, where 70% of the subjects at baseline had either an NIHSS score of more than 20 or a basilar occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thus, early clinical experience suggests that the PS allows revascularization in certain subjects experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
