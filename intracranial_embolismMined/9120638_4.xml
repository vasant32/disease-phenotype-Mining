<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first manifestations were symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, before the primary ruptured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013502" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">echinococcosis</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> was detected in the myocardium of the left ventricle, the patient underwent nine operations over an 8-year period for hydatid embolism affecting the brain and the femoral artery and was treated with concurrent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6704">mebendazole</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combined therapy would not have been successful without removal of the intracardiac hydatid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case is unusual because of the multiplicity of intracranial hydatid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> and its embolic origin from cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013502" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">echinococcosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present case is believed to be the first one in which the development of an embolism in the brain was studied by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
