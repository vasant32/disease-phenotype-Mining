<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between April 1984 and June 1989, 73 patients have undergone heart-lung transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Donors and recipients were carefully matched with regards to serology, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytomegalovirus compatibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heart preservation was based on use of cold St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thomas' cardioplegic solution; a pulmonary preservation fluid has been developed that allows distant organ procurement with a single pulmonary artery flush technique (Papworth solution) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recipients were: 21 pts with Eisenmenger's syndrome, 15 pts with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, 37 pts with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> (including 22 cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results are: no surgical mortality; no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac rejection episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients died (16 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, 3 with obliterative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011950'>bronchiolitis</z:hpo>, 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and 2 others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate at one year is 73.2%; 63% at two years and 47.4% at four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of transbronchial biopsy of the lung has provided accurate early and safe diagnosis of pulmonary rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Development in organ preservation and patient management, as well as careful selection of recipients and donors, have led to the effective use of resources and thereby to these good results </plain></SENT>
