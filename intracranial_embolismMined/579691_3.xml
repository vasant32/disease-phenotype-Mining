<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared with 2 groups of "controls"; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> clinically-well subjects and hospitalized patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> who exhibited minimal, stable, or improving neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of factor XIII concentrations developed in the 3 patient groups, together with concomitant significant increases in the proportion and concentration of plasma high molecular weight fibrin(ogen) complexes (HMWFC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation (p less than 0.05) between coagulation factor XIII concentration and percentage of HMWFC was demonstrated in the early stages of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of coagulation factor XIII concentration in these states, is secondary to extravascular or intravascular coagulation and may reflect its degree </plain></SENT>
