<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>End-point reduction was evaluated in two age groups, those not older than 65 years (1358 patients) and those who were older than 65 years (1142 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>End-point reduction was significantly greater in patients with active therapy than in the placebo group in both age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as an end-point indicated that younger patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (&lt; or = 65 years) had lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than those &gt; 65 years or patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall risk reduction was best in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients &gt; 65 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk reduction with study medication was 40-50% in both sexes and in both age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, age of the patient does not influence the efficacy of antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, since these results are obtained from a secondary analysis of a subgroup of patients, the results may need confirmation by further studies </plain></SENT>
