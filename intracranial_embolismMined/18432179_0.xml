<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cases of previous patch closure, transcatheter repair of residual shunts can be problematic due both to clinical decision-making in the presence of elevated pulmonary pressure and to a very old patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 70-year-old woman operated for an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> with synthetic patch closure when she was 35 years old was referred to our center because of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, initially decompensated right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with rest and exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> as results of a residual shunt and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete right heart catheterization confirmed a mean pulmonary pressure of about 55 mm Hg and a Qp:Qs ratio of 1.78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mechanical intracardiac echocardiography study with a 9F 9 MHz UltraICE catheter (Boston Scientific Corp.) showed a highly echogenous interatrial patch with a very stiff appearance and a very high residual defect of 8.7 and 11.2 mm on the aortic valve plane and on the four-chamber views, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An occlusion test with a compliant AGA medical balloon demonstrated a decrease in mean pulmonary pressure to 36 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
