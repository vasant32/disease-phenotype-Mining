<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stenting of isolated proximal LAD stenoses is still a controversial issue since it is associated with higher target vessel revascularization (TVR) rate than both bypass surgery using the internal mammary artery, and stenting of other coronary artery territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>- eluting stent (SES) has been reported to significantly reduce restenosis rates in de novo coronary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we compared patients from the German Cypher Registry treated with SES for isolated proximal LAD lesions with those stented for isolated lesions in the proximal LCX or RCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 349 patients treated with SES were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>249 patients were treated for proximal LAD stenosis, and 100 for proximal LCX/RCA stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combined clinical endpoint was MACCE (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of any cause, non-fatal MI and non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and TVR at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In-hospital events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, MI and TVR) did not differ significantly between both groups (3.2% for the LAD group vs 2.0% for the LCX/RCA-group, p=0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of any cause, non-fatal MI and non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at six months was 2.6% in the LAD group, and 2.2% in the LCX/RCA group (p=1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TVR occurred in 4.8% of the LAD group and in 6.5% of the LCX/RCA group at six months (p=0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients free from <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> at daily activities was 80.6% in the LAD group, and 77.4% in the LCX/ RCA group (p=0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SES once implanted into isolated proximal LAD stenoses appears as effective as reported in other vessel territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, stenting of the proximal LAD using SES might prove a suitable alternative to surgery </plain></SENT>
