<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is recent evidence that, like the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome (FES), which often has a component of neurologic dysfunction, total joint arthroplasty and femoral nailing are associated with intraoperative brain embolization as determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there are good data demonstrating that intraoperative brain embolization occurs during total joint arthroplasties, the makeup and, even more importantly, the clinical significance of these emboli remain speculative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain microemboli resulting from cardiac surgery occur by the millions and may cause focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulting in significant neurologic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our studies suggest that the major source of these microemboli is <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets of the patient's fat that drip into the blood in the surgical field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-laden blood is aspirated and then returned to the patient via the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our investigations have focused on the causes (microemboli), consequences (brain damage), and strategies for elimination of brain <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> microemboli resulting from salvaged blood collected during surgery </plain></SENT>
