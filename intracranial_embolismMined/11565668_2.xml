<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral embolization is a major cause of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies demonstrate that reductions in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) can reduce cerebral embolization during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the effects of brief PaCO2 manipulations on cerebral embolization in patients undergoing cardiac valve procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were prospectively randomized to either <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> (PaCO2 = 30 to 32 mm Hg, n = 30) or normocapnia (PaCO2 = 40 to 42 mm Hg, n = 31) before aortic cross-clamp removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With removal of the aortic cross-clamp embolic signals were recorded by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography for the next 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite significant differences in PaCO2, groups did not differ statistically in total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean number of embolic events was 107 +/- 100 (median, 80) in the hypocapnic group and 135 +/- 115 (median, 96) in the normocapnic group, respectively (p = 0.315) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Due to the high between-patient variability in embolization, reductions in PaCO2 did not result in a statistically significant decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to experimental studies, the beneficial effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> on cerebral embolization could not be demonstrated in humans </plain></SENT>
