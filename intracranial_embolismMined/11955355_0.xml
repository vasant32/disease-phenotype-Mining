<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Angiograms of the external carotid artery in 250 cases were analyzed, including 35 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> and 215 cases of head and neck lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 35 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>, 14 middle meningeal arteries (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi>) were found to participate in the blood supply of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 11 superficial temporal arteries and 7 occipital arteries supplied the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cases with ligated external carotid artery (ECA) had the pharyngo-occipital anastomasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the ophthalmic arteries in three cases were found to originate from the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The external carotid artery has a variety of anastomasis with the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under such circumstances, special measures must be taken to circumvent inadvertent intracranial embolization </plain></SENT>
