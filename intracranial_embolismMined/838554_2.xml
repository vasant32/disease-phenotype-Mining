<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A loading dose of 0.82 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53691">diatrizoate</z:chebi>/kg followed by a stead infusion of 0.01 mg/kg was required to attain and maintain plasma concentrations of approximately 400 mg/100 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lowering the beam energy resulted in a substantial increase in the EMI numbers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53691">diatrizoate</z:chebi> and significant improvement in the delineation of contrast containing lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A contrast index estimating the volume of pixel containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53691">diatrizoate</z:chebi> was calculated for five diagnosed lesions and this factor appears to be related to vascularity and extravasation </plain></SENT>
