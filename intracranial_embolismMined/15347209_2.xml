<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-three lesions in 40 patients were treated by carotid stenting with distal balloon protection for nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> postdilation procedures and some predilation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following variables were statistically analyzed for association with PNCs: diameter of the angioplasty balloon used for predilation, use of a distal protection balloon during predilation, use of a protection balloon during postdilation, lesion-bifurcation distance, length of the lesion, age, clinical presentation of the lesion (symptomatic or asymptomatic), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PNCs occurred in five patients, four with minor deficits and one with major deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed large diameter of the predilation angioplasty balloon (p = 0.0026), use of a protection balloon during predilation (p = 0.0075), lesion length (p = 0.0003), and lesion-bifurcation distance (p = 0.0006) were significantly associated with PNCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of these four variables showed that use of a large angioplasty balloon for predilation was the only independent predictor (p = 0.004, odds ratio 34.00) for the occurrence of PNCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Use of a large angioplasty balloon for predilation carries the risk of periprocedural embolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, even when a protection device is used, predilation should be performed with a small balloon </plain></SENT>
