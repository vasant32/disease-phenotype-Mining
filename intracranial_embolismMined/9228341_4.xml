<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were operated on at the Neurosurgical Department of Ataturk University Medical School, Erzurum, Turkiye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent surgery for the lesions necessitating the right or left pterional approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings were recorded during surgical intervention and observed through the operative sketches of the pathologies, the slides, and videotapes of the operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our study, we surgically classified the variations of sylvian vein, according to its branching and draining patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type I: The fronto-orbital (frontosylvian), fronto-parietal (parietosylvian) and anterior temporal (temporosylvian) veins drain into one sylvian vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type II: Two superficial sylvian veins with separated basal vein draining into the sphenoparietal and Rosenthal's basal vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type III: Two superficial sylvian veins draining into the sphenoparietal and the superior petrosal veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type IV: Hypoplastic superficial sylvian vein and the deep one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four types of sylvian vein variations were defined as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The type I was seen in 52.8% (n = 396), the type II was found in 19.2% (n = 144), type III was recorded in 18.2% (n = 137), and type IV, or hypoplastic and deep form was discovered in 9.8% (n = 73) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The coursing of sylvian vein was in the temporal side (Temporal Coursing) in 62.4 percent of the cases (n = 469), in the frontal side (Frontal Coursing) in 25 % of the patients (n = 187) and in 9 percent of the cases (n = 67) in the deep localization (Deep Coursing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 3.6% of the cases (n = 27) showed Mixed Coursing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The variations of the sylvian cisterns were classified into three types, according to the relationships between the lateral fronto-orbital gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In Sylvian type, the frontal and temporal lobes are loosely (Sylvian Type A, wide and large) or tightly (Sylvian Type B, close and narrow) approximated on the surface thereby covering the substance of the sylvian cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In Frontal Type, the proximal part of the lateral fronto-orbital gyrus herniated into the temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In Temporal Type, the proximal part of the superior temporal gyrus herniated into the lateral fronto-orbital gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The variations of the sylvian cisterns in 750 patients with different pathologies, were as follows: in 47.7% (n = 358) Sylvian type A, in 27.2% percent (n = 204) Sylvian type B, in 16.3% (n = 122) frontal type and in 8.8% (n = 66) temporal type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We concluded that venous perfusion discorder of the brain is the most important factor during the pterional approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Careful intraoperative assessment and protection of the sylvian vein, which is a surgical pitfall, is an indispensable part of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The recognition of the anatomical variations of the sylvian vein and cistern, and the detailed knowledge of the microvascular relationships and the importance of preservation of this vein at that level, will allow the neurosurgeon, believing in the minimally invasive neurosurgical techniques, to construct a better and safer microdissection plan, to save time, and can prevent postoperative neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
