<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The activities of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15524">glutaryl-CoA</z:chebi> reductase and RBC <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-potasium ATPase as well as serum levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, digoxin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16091">dolichol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16389">ubiquinone</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The tyrosine/tryptophan catabolic patterns, glycoconjugate metabolism, free radical metabolism and RBC membrane composition were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, there was elevated digoxin synthesis, increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16091">dolichol</z:chebi> and glycoconjugate levels, and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16389">ubiquinone</z:chebi> and elevated free radical levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also an increase in tryptophan catabolites and a reduction in tyrosine catabolites: and an increase in the cholesterol: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> ratio with a reduction in the glycoconjugate levels of the RBC membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same biochemical patterns were obtained in individuals with right hemispheric dominance whereas the patterns were reversed in patients with left hemispheric dominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is associated with an upregulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24913">isoprenoid</z:chebi> pathway and elevated digoxin secretion from the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This occurs in right hemisphere-dominant individuals </plain></SENT>
