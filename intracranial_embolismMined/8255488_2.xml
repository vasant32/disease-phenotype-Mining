<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>Bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo> constitute the most common congenital heart abnormality, and have a tendency to become stenosed, regurgitant, calcified, or infected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of heavy calcification in a noninfected bicuspid valve may lead to dislodgement of calcific embolic material which is not necessarily heralded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> valvular rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accurate localization of the calcific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> to the right supraclinoid internal carotid artery was provided by spiral CT imaging in this case </plain></SENT>
