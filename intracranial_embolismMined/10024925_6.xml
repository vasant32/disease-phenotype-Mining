<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were ascertained retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their case notes were reviewed, and stored or new blood was assayed for factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation, prothrombin gene mutation 20201A, and 5,10 methylene <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clinical risk factor was identified in 13 patients--the oral contraceptive pill (5), puerperium (1), HRT (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> (1), lumbar puncture and myelography (1), <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, two patients had the FVL mutation and five (one of whom also had the FVL mutation) were homozygous for the MTHFR mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter showed a higher than expected frequency compared to 300 healthy controls from South Wales (OR 3.15.95% Cl 1.01-9.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient had the prothrombin 20201A mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients died and three had a monocular visual deficit following anticoagulation (13) or thrombolytic (2) treatment, but there was no association between the presence of a primary prothrombotic risk factor and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the importance of investigating patients for both clinical predisposing factors and primary prothrombotic states </plain></SENT>
