<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considerable morbidity is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome, and post operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> is frequently seen, yet the exact pathophysiology remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative cerebral microemboli can be detected using transcranial Doppler ultrasound and moreover the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) may be examined for using a validated technique employing this modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> may act as a conduit for embolic material to traverse from the venous to the systemic circulation and consequently affect cerebral function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We wished to 1) investigate the incidence of cerebral microembolisation during primary hybrid total hip arthroplasty and compare this with hip resurfacing, 2) examine the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> on cerebral microembolisation and 3)assess the influence of cerebral microemboli on the outcome of patients undergoing these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We prospectively compared 12 patients undergoing hip resurfacing with 12 patients undergoing hybrid total hip replacement (THR) for the incidence and load of intraoperative cerebral microemboli, using transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were tested for the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> using a validated technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome was assessed using the WOMAC, Harris Hip Score, Oxford Hip Score and EuroQoL quality of life measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient in the hip resurfacing group demonstrated intra-operative cerebral microembolisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients in the THR group showed transcranial Doppler evidence of microemobli during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With the small numbers of patients available, there was not a significant difference in microemboli load between the groups (p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> (p = 0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant relationship between the incidence and total microemboli load and the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> (p = 0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in outcome at six months between patients who demonstrated microemboli and those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cerebral microembolisation during hip resurfacing appears to be very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although our study demonstrated cerebral microemboli in a significant proportion of patients undergoing primary hybrid THR, the numbers of microemboli were low and the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> did not influence microemboli incidence or load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Finally, patients who demonstrated cerebral microemboli did not have a worse outcome than patients who did not </plain></SENT>
