<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basic goals of a novel closed minimized extracorporeal circulation are to prevent excessive hemodilution and to avoid blood-air interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective randomized study was to determine the effect of using the minimized extracorporeal circulation system compared with open conventional extracorporeal circulation on cerebral tissue oxygenation and microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (20 in each group) were continuously monitored for changes in cerebral oxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and tissue oxygenation index by using near-infrared spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total microembolic count and gaseous embolic count in both median cerebral arteries were monitored with multifrequency transcranial Doppler instrumentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the conventional extracorporeal circulation group there was a highly significant reduction in both cerebral oxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and tissue oxygenation index from the start to the end of cardiopulmonary bypass (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of decrease in cerebral oxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> after aortic cannulation was faster in the conventional extracorporeal circulation group (F test = 9.03, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant changes with respect to cerebral oxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> or tissue oxygenation index occurred in the minimized extracorporeal circulation group, except at the beginning of rewarming (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total embolic count, as well as gaseous embolic count, in the left and right median cerebral arteries was significantly lower in the minimized extracorporeal circulation group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was greater (P &lt; .05) and the transfusion rate was higher (P &lt; .05) in the conventional extracorporeal circulation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of closed minimized cardiopulmonary bypass compared with conventional open cardiopulmonary bypass preserves cerebral tissue oxygenation and reduces cerebral microembolization </plain></SENT>
