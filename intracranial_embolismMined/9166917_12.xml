<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microspheres (48 microm) were injected into the right internal carotid artery of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Learning and memory functions were measured 7 or more days after the embolism by active and passive avoidance, and water maze tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the biochemical study, cortical <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> contents, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase activity were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical acetylcholinesterase-containing fibers were quantitatively estimated in the embolized rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The active and passive avoidance, and water maze tasks were impaired in the microsphere-embolized rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the histochemical study, the density of cortical acetylcholinesterase-containing fibers of the ipsilateral hemisphere of the microsphere-embolized rat was decreased, but cell density was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, microsphere embolism decreased the cortical <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> concentration and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase activity and increased the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that microsphere embolism causes severe damage to cortical cholinergic neurons, which may be, at least in part, related to the impairment of learning and memory functions in the sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
