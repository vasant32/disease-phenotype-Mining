<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Routine assessment of the neonatal brain is performed by ultrasound through the anterior fontanelle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The infratentorial structures can be visualised more detailed by sonography through the posterolateral fontanelle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective study was performed to evaluate anterior fontanelle and posterolateral fontanelle for the detection of infratentorial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Cerebral sonography was performed in 100 preterm infants at the median (range) age of 9 days (0 - 91 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median gestational age at birth was 33 weeks (23 - 36 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Scanning through the posterolateral fontanelle was performed after sonography through the anterior fontanelle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neuropathology could be detected in 22 of the 100 preterms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six patients infratentorial lesions were present in association with supratentorial pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The infratentorial abnormalities were clots in the IV. ventricle (n=3), clots in the cisterna magna (n=2), dilation of the IV. ventricle (n=3), dilation of the aqueduct (n=1), and a intraparenchymatous echodensity in the cerebellum (n=1) which receded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When clots were present in the lateral ventricles only the sonography through the posterolateral fontanelle allowed the detection of the infratentorial abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sonography through the posterolateral fontanelle allows the detection of infratentorial pathology missed by sonography through the anterior fontanelle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional scanning through the posterolateral fontanelle should be part of the standard neonatal cerebral sonography </plain></SENT>
