<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, with alkaline phosphatase vascular staining, we found an acellular fatty material in brain microvasculature from autopsy material of patients who died shortly after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These fatty intravascular collections range in diameter from 10 to 70 microns, a size that lodges in the smallest vessels of the microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They have been found in numbers sufficient to cause detectable neurologic dysfunction and are believed, but not proved, to be emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By sequentially injecting colored microspheres, we can determine when emboli occur during experimental cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ongoing related studies, magnetic resonance imaging was performed before cardiac valve replacement in 39 patients for whom preoperative and postoperative neurologic and neuropsychologic testing was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results suggest that magnetic resonance imaging evidence of prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is not a significant risk factor for cognitive or motor decrement after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
