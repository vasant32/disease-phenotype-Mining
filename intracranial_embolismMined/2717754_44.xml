<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with a low likelihood of cerebrovascular disease (control group) and 40 patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease were imaged with a FISP (fast imaging with steady precession) sequence (repetition time of 50 msec, echo time of 15 msec, velocity compensation in the read and section-select directions with acceleration compensation in the read direction, 15 degrees anisotropic volume, and a 1.25-mm partition thickness) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four percent of images in the control group and 72% of images in the group with cerebrovascular disease were considered useful for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique can provide accurate images of intracranial circulation and can be performed in conjunction with two-dimensional spin-echo or gradient-echo imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was most useful in the evaluation of patent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, vessel displacement, and large-vessel occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disadvantages included limited field of view, persistent signal voids, limited spatial resolution, and inadequate depiction of lesions with slow flow </plain></SENT>
