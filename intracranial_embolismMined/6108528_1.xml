<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Supplementary 133Xe CBF measurements were made at corresponding intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Persistent zones of zero flow surrounded by reduced flow were measured predominantly in subcortical regions, which showed gross and microscopic evidence of infarction at necropsy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced lambda values attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> appeared within 3--5 minutes and progressed up to 60 minutes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> animals, lambda values were persistently reduced in areas showing histologic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contralateral hemispheric CBF increased for the first 15 minutes after embolism, followed by progressive reduction after 30 minutes (diaschisis) </plain></SENT>
