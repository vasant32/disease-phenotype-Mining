<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA) in relatively young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) and their role in subsequent coronary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 124 relatively young survivors (aged 65 or younger) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI, ACLA were measured in a controlled prospective study on admission and 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myocardial reinfarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> during a mean follow-up period of 19 +/- 3 months were diagnosed by standard tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen (14%) of the 124 patients were ACLA positive (either IgM or IgG) upon admission compared with 2 out of 76 (3%) of the control group matched for age and coronary risk factors (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of ACLA remained unchanged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 patient 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial reinfarction</z:e> was significantly higher in the ACLA-positive patients as compared with the ACLA-negative group: 41% versus 4% (P &lt; 0.0001) and 35% versus 10% (P &lt; 0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression, high titer of ACLA was found to be the only independent risk factor for subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial reinfarction</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of ACLA was found in relatively young survivors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of ACLA is a marker for increased risk of subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial reinfarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI </plain></SENT>
