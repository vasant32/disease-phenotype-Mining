<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggested an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> when the aortic valve is crossed to obtain 'pull-back' gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a large questionnaire based study to evaluate current practice in the assessment of aortic valve gradient amongst cardiologists and the preferences of cardiac surgeons in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>E-mail questionnaires were sent to 645 (72%) UK consultant cardiologists and to 198 (92%) UK consultant cardiac surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>232 cardiologists and 52 cardiac surgeons responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>53% of cardiologists routinely attempt to cross the valve in moderate AS while only 23% do so in severe AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>38% of cardiologists in the age group '50+ years' cross the valve in severe AS compared to 13% in the age group '30-40 years' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Common reasons given for crossing a stenosed valve included 'to verify the echocardiographic gradient' (85%) and 'maintaining skill' (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>64% of cardiologists have changed their views on the necessity of crossing the valve in the last ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the majority appreciate the increased risk of crossing the valve only 18% of patients are consented differently if crossing the valve is planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>26% of cardiac surgeons prefer the valve to be crossed to provide information on 'pull-back' gradient, 32% for LV function assessment and 14% to confirm MV competence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>92% would accept echocardiographic data alone if both the gradient and aortic valve area were available and considered correct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our survey found that the practice of crossing the aortic valve has changed in the last 10 years and that younger consultant cardiologists are less likely to cross the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Increasing confidence in echocardiographic data and potential complications of crossing the valve are implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>92% of cardiac surgeons do not require the valve to be crossed if the echo data is considered accurate </plain></SENT>
