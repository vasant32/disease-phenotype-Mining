<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether muscarinic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptors (mAChR) in the post-ischemic hippocampus may be involved in altered extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signal transduction, we have investigated changes in the activity of ERK1/2 induced by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38325">muscarinic agonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced in the rat by injecting 900 microspheres (48 microm in diameter) into the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Applying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> to the contralateral hippocampal slices from ischemic rats increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but did not increase phosphorylation in the ipsilateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of M(1) mAChR binding showed that there was no significant difference in the number and K(d) values between the hippocampi from na√Øve and ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting analysis showed no significant difference in the amount of M(1) mAChR in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> stimulation, the protein kinase C activator induced an activation of ERK1/2 in the ipsilateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This increase was shown to occur in neurons by immunofluorescence colocalization study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">Carbachol</z:chebi>-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the G alpha(q/11), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, and association of G alpha(q/11) with phospholipase C beta 1 were attenuated in the ipsilateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found that stimulation of group I metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors, which are linked to G alpha(q/11), failed to increase in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the ipsilateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that failure in receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the G alpha(q/11) subunit and a defect in receptor-G alpha(q/11-)effector coupling in the ischemic hippocampus may be involved in alterations of ERK signal transduction </plain></SENT>
