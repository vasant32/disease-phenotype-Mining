<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 90 patients were treated for internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis with a stent device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A PAES device was used in 31 symptomatic and 5 asymptomatic patients (total 36 patients) with ICA stenosis, and 54 patients were stented without any protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging was performed before and after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the group without PAES protection, 23 out of 54 patients showed new lesions on DW images after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the lesions seen, 147 (2.72 lesions/patient) were in the vessel-dependent area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group with protection, 19 out of 36 patients had new lesions, and only 34 (0.94 lesions/patient) were noted in the vessel-dependent area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of new lesions in the nondependent vessel area did not differ if a protection system was used (P = 0.671) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of PAES led to a significant reduction (P = 0.024) in the incidence of the most frequently seen lesions (size &lt;2 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 3.3% overall, 3.7% in the group without protection device, and 2.7% in the PAES group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no permanent neurological deficits after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The PAES is a safe and effective tool to reduce the incidence of embolic complications during carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Older patients and patients with higher grade stenosis seem to profit more </plain></SENT>
