<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A baseline examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> residents aged 40 years and over, in the A-I district, Shibata City, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, was conducted in July 1977 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The response rate for this examination was 84.5% for males and 92.6% for females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine hundred sixty males and 1,339 females, who were initially free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, constituted the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly 984 males and 1,342 females, who were free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> on effort, made up the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cohorts were followed for 10 years through June 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, in the agricultural community, the strongest risk factor for not only <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and that the attribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The population that was studied experienced a period of relative economic deprivation before 1950, and there seems to be residual effects from this period to this day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> used in this study includes several pathologically different types (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of the cortical branches, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of the perforating branches, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and so on), and this may affect the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the strongest risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> found in the A-I district is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This differs from the European/American type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, to which <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are basic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results also suggest the possibility that there is a difference not only etiologically but pathologically between the two types </plain></SENT>
