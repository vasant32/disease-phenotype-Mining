<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased concentrations were found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-embolic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarctions</z:e> and haemorrhage compared with patients having old infarctions or with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CSF-Zn concentrations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarctions correlated significantly with the total protein and albumin concentrations of CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the CSF concentrations between the first and second lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The size of the infarctions on CT scan did not correlate with the CSF parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High CSF concentrations of Zn, total protein and albumin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarctions related to a poor short-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study shows that CSF-Zn determinations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular diseases may be of diagnostic and prognostic value </plain></SENT>
