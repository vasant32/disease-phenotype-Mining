<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The goal of the present study was to examine whether suprasternal harmonic imaging (SHI) (i.e., harmonic imaging from the suprasternal windows) can visualize protruding arch atheromas (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAAs</z:chebi>) and reliably predict the presence or absence of significant lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Protruding arch atheromas are a major source of cerebral and peripheral embolism and probably the most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during cardiac catheterization and open-heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preprocedural screening by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) would be desirable but is limited by the nature of the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 354 patients who underwent a TEE study in our laboratory during the study period, 106 were referred for detection of a source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings were classified based on the French Aortic Plaque study criteria as: 1) no or minimal atherosclerotic changes; 2) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAAs</z:chebi> &lt; 4 mm; 3) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAAs</z:chebi> &gt; or =4 mm or presence of a mobile component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adequate transcutaneous image quality could be achieved in 89 patients (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protruding arch atheromas were present in 42 patients (47%) and absent in 47 (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative predictive values for large <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAAs</z:chebi> on TEE were 91% and 98%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one case, SHI detected a complex <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> inaccessible for TEE due to interposition of the left bronchus as demonstrated by dual helical computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inter-observer agreement for SHI was 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Suprasternal harmonic imaging reliably predicted or excluded the presence of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAAs</z:chebi> in a sizable, consecutive group of patients referred to TEE for detection of a source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It represents an excellent screening test and provides complimentary views of regions, which may be blind spots for TEE </plain></SENT>
