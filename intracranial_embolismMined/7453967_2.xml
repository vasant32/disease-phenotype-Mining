<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective review about large and giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the literature and the own material (51 large and 19 giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>) the problems of distribution, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present classification and interpretation are arbitrary and imprecise; size and form, site, origin, and projection have not been taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A special analysis and a combined study of large and giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The own material discussed concerns distribution and classification as well as clinical and neuroradiological findings in the different locations of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main locations are for large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> ICA (17%), <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (about 10%), and VBA (about 9%), and for giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> 3.5%, 3.6%, and 8.6% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative distribution for giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are ICA with about 50%, ACA with 20%, and VBA with 20% too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The management of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and to a lesser extent of large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> as well is unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The development of CT-scanning and microsurgery with arterial bypass operations and intracranial artery sutures has improved the therapeutic possibilities tremendously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some cases are briefly discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prospective personal strategy in handling large and giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> by direct attack or a combined procedure with external-internal artery bypass operation and a direct occlusion and excision in a second stage have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because of the limited experience, a cooperative prospective study of interpretation, classification, clinical data, course, and therapy of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in a representative group of patients is necessary </plain></SENT>
