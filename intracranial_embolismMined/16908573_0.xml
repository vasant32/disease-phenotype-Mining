<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study sought to determine whether the angiographic demonstration of slow antegrade contrast opacification of an occluded cerebral artery distal to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (clot outline sign) on cerebral arteriograms performed immediately before thrombolytic treatment is associated with higher recanalization rates relative to patients without antegrade contrast opacification distal to the occlusion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The angiographic images of 100 consecutive arteriograms performed before thrombolysis in patients eligible for intra-arterial thrombolysis from May 1995 to February 2005 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A modified Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> flow grade (mTIMI) was adapted to grade recanalization after cerebral thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clot outline sign was defined as slow antegrade contrast opacification distal to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> on the delayed images of the presenting arteriogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis for mTIMI grade included the following potential predictors: presence of outline sign, age, time to treatment, sex, site of occlusion, presenting National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score, presenting platelets, presenting systolic blood pressure, presence of pial collaterals, and admitting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-seven arteriograms were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 19 (22%) displayed the clot outline sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (69%) of 19 had clot outline sign, and 16 of 68 (29%) were not completely recanalized (mTIMI = 3); 95% with clot outline sign and 54% without were associated with either mTIMI 2 or 3 (P = .0055, Pearson correlation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis for recanalization relative to other predictors indicates that only the clot outline sign could act as a statistically significant predictor for recanalization (P = .0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prethrombolysis cerebral arteriograms demonstrating delayed antegrade contrast opacification distal to the occlusion site are associated with higher recanalization rates </plain></SENT>
