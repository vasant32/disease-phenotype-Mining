<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The value of anticoagulation therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, however, is less well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in 191 consecutive unselected patients referred for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A history of embolic events was noted in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> embolism (&lt;48 hours) occurred in 4 patients (3 after direct current cardioversion, 1 after catheter ablation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of 26+/-18 months, 9 patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, the overall embolic event rate (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> during follow-up) was 7 % in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk indicators for an embolic event in an univariate analysis were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747057" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organic heart disease</z:e> (p = 0.037), depressed left ventricular function (p = 0.02), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.004), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (p = 0.0038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate analysis, a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was the only independent predictor for elevated embolic risk in this patient population (odds ratio = 6.5; 95% confidence intervals 1.5 to 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the thromboembolic risk is higher than previously recognized for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy may decrease this risk </plain></SENT>
