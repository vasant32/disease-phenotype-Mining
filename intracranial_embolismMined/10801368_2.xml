<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between intima-media thickness in the common carotid artery, plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in the carotid bifurcation and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Design prospective study of consecutive patients referred for carotid duplex examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and eighty-eight patients were classified by one of two neurologists into four categories (symptomatic, asymptomatic, undefined, uncertain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was measured by means of high-resolution ultrasound technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid plaques were classified based on visual evaluation of plaque echogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) was correlated to presence of plaques, age and gender, but not to symptoms referable to the carotid circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid plaques were more common in symptomatic than in asymptomatic vessels (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in plaque occurrence between the ipsi- and contralateral sides in the symptomatic patients, neither in frequency of echolucent plaques between the sides or between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Echogenic plaques were more common and generally smaller than echolucent plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> correlates with presence of plaques, but not with symptoms from the territory supplied by the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Echolucent plaques in the carotid bifurcation are not more frequently symptomatic than echogenic plaques are, in patients with low-to-moderate degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
