<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study compared patients treated by craniectomy for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the middle cerebral artery and patients treated medically for severe or malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the same cerebral territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were paired according to age, lesion side and hospitalization period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients treated by craniectomy (age 43+/-10.44) were paired with 12 patients treated medically (age 49+/-7.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two groups were comparable in terms of general undesirable medical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The medical events related to craniectomy are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evolution of patient deficiencies, the length of the hospital stay (194+/-118.93 days vs 152+/-94.64 days), the Functional Independence Measure at discharge (87+/-21.28 vs 95+/-22.19) and the number of direct home discharges (7 vs 9) did not significantly differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: No more medical problems were observed in the patients treated by craniectomy than in the patients treated medically, except for the medical events specifically related to craniectomy, which extended the hospital stay but had no major repercussions </plain></SENT>
