<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed radionuclide venography using the Valsalva maneuver, followed by (99m)Tc-macroaggregated albumin (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>) brain SPECT to investigate the fate of emboli originating from the lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients (9 men, 1 woman; mean age, 61 +/- 17 y) with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> underwent radionuclide venography with and without the Valsalva maneuver on the whole-body image, followed by brain SPECT with (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> to determine the cortical uptake that would detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After counts in each region of interest (ROI) were normalized by comparison with the averaged count, the distribution of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> was compared with that of (99m)Tc-hexamethyl-propyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO) brain SPECT by drawing ROIs on frontal, temporoparietal (anterior circulation territory), occipital, and cerebellar areas (posterior circulation territory) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The thyroid on the whole-body scan was visualized after the Valsalva maneuver in 2 of the 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 7 of 10 patients, 56 ROIs in the visualized cortical uptake showed that the distribution of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> correlated well with that of HMPAO according to the equation: HMPAO = -71.21 + 1.71 x <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>, (r = 0.575, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The excess difference in the relative counts in the posterior over anterior circulation territory was 5.6% and 16.1% of the HMPAO and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> values, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Brain SPECT with (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> was more sensitive than thyroid visualization in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The excess flow in the posterior cerebral circulation indicated an increased likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> originating from the lower extremities and indicated that the flow difference between HMPAO and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> probably resulted from poor linearization of HMPAO in the high-flow area </plain></SENT>
