<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The main purpose of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for neurologically symptomatic high-grade extracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> is to remove the suspected source of cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography has the potential for detecting solid microemboli in the basal cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, TCD monitoring provides the opportunity to assess the rate of microemboli to the brain in patients with symptomatic high-grade carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and to verify whether these phenomena have ceased after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TCD monitoring was performed in 41 patients to detect high-intensity transient signals indicating microemboli in the middle cerebral artery before and after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the event that, within 1 week after CEA, TCD monitoring revealed ongoing cerebral microemboli on the side of surgery, the examination was repeated 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-intensity transient signals were detected preoperatively on the side of the affected carotid artery in 22 patients (54%; mean, 10.2 per hour; range, 1 to 88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis demonstrated a trend toward an inverse relationship between the number of high-intensity transient signals per hour and the time interval since the last episode of neurological symptoms (P &lt; .1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CEA resulted in a significant reduction in the number of high-intensity transient signals per hour 7 days after surgery (mean, 6.0 versus 0.4 per hour; median, 0 versus 0; n = 37; P &lt; .005) and 3 months later (mean, 6.3 versus 0 per hour; median, 1.3 versus 0; n = 41; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clearly, TCD monitoring can be helpful in assessing the effect of CEA in removing the suspected source of cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ongoing microemboli to the brain should prompt reassessment of the operated carotid artery or a search for other potential sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery plaques seem to produce cerebral microemboli for a limited period, which implies that the prophylactic effect of CEA might decrease if the operation is delayed </plain></SENT>
