<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To test the safety and feasibility of using direct instillation of urokinase to induce rapid lysis of intraventricular clots, an animal model of intraventricular blood cast is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Injections of 11 ml of fresh, unclotted autologous blood into the ventricles of adult mongrel dogs did not produce a solid blood cast in the ventricular system, suggesting that the adult dogs have an unusual ability to clear uncoagulated whole blood from the ventricles and subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Injection of 9 ml of preclotted blood resulted in a subtotal cast of the ventricles, leaving only portions of the occipital horns free of solid clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This volume of injected clots incurred no mortality and minimal morbidity, whereas injection of 10 to 12 ml resulted in a mortality of 42% and formidable morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The technique of producing this intraventricular blood cast model, as well as that of implanting an indwelling ventricular catheter-reservoir system useful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> urokinase administration, is described </plain></SENT>
