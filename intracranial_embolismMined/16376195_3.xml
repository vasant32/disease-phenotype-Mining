<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether there are differences in outcome between various patch materials is still not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate whether a relationship exists between the patch type and the number of microemboli as registered during CEA by transcranial Doppler imaging, the clinical outcome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>), and the occurrence of restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 319 patients who underwent CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative microembolus registration was performed in 205 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microembolization was recorded during four different periods: dissection, shunting, clamp release, and wound closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decision to perform primary closure or to use a patch for the closure of the arteriotomy was made by the surgeon, and Dacron patches were used when venous material was insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral events were recorded within the first month after CEA, and duplex scanning was performed at 3 months (n = 319) and 1 year (n = 166) after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A diameter reduction of more than 70% was defined as restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary, venous, and Dacron patch closures were performed in 83 (26.0%), 171 (53.6%), and 65 (20.4%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Primary closure was significantly related to sex (Dacron patch, 35 men and 30 women; venous patch, 108 men and 63 women; primary closure, 72 men and 11 women; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of microemboli during wound closure was also related to sex (women, 2.5 +/- 0.6; men, 1.0 +/- 0.2; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, during clamp release, Dacron patches were associated with significantly more microemboli than venous patches (11.1 +/- 3.4 vs 4.0 +/- 0.9; P &lt; .01), and this difference was also noted during wound closure (3.1 +/- 0.9 vs 1.4 +/- 0.4; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>Transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> after CEA occurred in 5 (2.4%) of 205 and 6 (2.9%) of 205 procedures, respectively, and the degree of microembolization during dissection was related to adverse cerebral events (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the type of closure was not related to immediate clinical adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, primary closure and Dacron patches were associated with an increase in the restenosis rate compared with venous patches: after 400 days, the restenosis rate for Primary closure was 11%, Dacron patch 16%, and venous patch 7% (P = .05; Kaplan-Meier estimates) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microemboli are more prevalent during clamp releases and wound closure when Dacron patches are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the observed differences in embolization noted by patch type were mainly evident in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the use of Dacron patches was not related to immediate ischemic cerebral events but was associated with a higher restenosis rate compared with venous patch closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This suggests that venous patch closure may be preferred for CEA </plain></SENT>
