<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO), and the Toronto Embolic Scale (<z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi>) to decide (1) whether TCD, HMPAO-SPECT, and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi> can improve on clinical and CT tests to predict spontaneous HT and (2) whether SPECT can help to predict the outcome of symptomatic HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prognostic criteria included Canadian Neurological Scale (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) scores &lt; or = 50 on admission, early ischemic changes on CT, M1 middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on TCD, the focal absence of brain perfusion on SPECT, and a high risk of cardiogenic embolism on <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In part 1, 85 consecutive patients admitted within the first 6 hours were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No patient received thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HT was found in 11 patients (13%) at 3 to 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Admission <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and CT were not predictive of HT: odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.49 (0.18 to 1.23) (P = .1) and 0.88 (0.23 to 3.45) (P = .8), respectively, TCD, SPECT, and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi> were significant predictors of HT (P &lt; .05), as follows: TCD, 8.67 (1.42 to 70.59); SPECT, 17.40 (2.69 to 170.89); and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi>, 18.13 (2.6 to 406.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In part 2, 490 consecutive patients were studied and 21 (4%) had symptomatic HT, of which 12 had focal hypoperfusion on SPECT at 4 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and 9 had focal hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with hypoperfusion had larger CT lesions (115 +/- 97 versus 42 +/- 29 cm3; P = .04) and poorer outcome at 2 weeks (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, 38 +/- 45 versus 96 +/- 10; P = .001), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (6/12 versus 0/9; P = .04); compared with those with hyperperfusion on SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High risk of cardioembolism, M1 middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and absence of collateral flow evaluated by <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi>, TCD, and SPECT help to identify patients at risk for spontaneous HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="34" ids="39035">TES</z:chebi> was the most powerful predictor of HT, SPECT is the best single adjunct to the triage of clinical and CT tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with brain hyperperfusion on HMPAO-SPECT after symptomatic HT have better chances for recovery </plain></SENT>
