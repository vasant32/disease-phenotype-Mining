<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of delayed intraarterial urokinase therapy with mechanical disruption of clot to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with cerebral thrombolic disease (10 carotid territory, 3 basilar territory) were treated with catheter-directed intraarterial urokinase therapy with mechanical disruption of the clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were excluded from a 6-hour multicenter thrombolytic trial by either time, recent surgery, age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time elapsed before treatment ranged from 3.5 to 48 hours (12 +/- 13 hours), with 200,000 to 900,000 U of urokinase used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients had successful vessel recanalization, confirmed by repeat angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with distal branch vessel occlusions were less likely to recanalize </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic hemorrhagic conversion occurred in 2 patients on repeat scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic and functional outcomes were assessed with significant improvement occurring in 9 (69%) of 13 patients at 48 hours (greater than four-point change on the National Institutes of Health scale) and in 100% of 3-month survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who improved had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> initial CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraarterial cerebral thrombolysis with mechanical disruption of clot seems to be a useful therapy in selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases even after 6 hours </plain></SENT>
