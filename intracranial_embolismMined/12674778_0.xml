<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVMs</z:mp> verified by pulmonary arterial angiography were treated by transcatheter coils embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chest X-ray (11 cases), computer tomography (7 cases) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (2 cases) were performed before embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood-gas analysis was done in 5 cases before and after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up materials of 8 patients were collected to evaluate the effect of embolization with coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations included cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> and decreased oxygenation in 9 patients and the remaining 2 had no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>9/11 cases were found by chest X-ray and 8 were diagnosed definitely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>7/7, 2/2 cases were diagnosed by CT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and diagnosis was made in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Embolization was performed in 29 vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood of 5 cases changed significantly before and after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Slight complications occurred in 6 patients, such as low <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002102'>pleurisy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The follow-up results showed that 7 cases were cured effectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No primary and secondary device migration, and no medical paradoxical embolization occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that coils embolization is a well-established method for treating <z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is a minimally invasive lung preserving treatment with high efficiency and less complication </plain></SENT>
