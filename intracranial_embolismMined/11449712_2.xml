<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT scan revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the left cerebral sulcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first angiography was performed 3 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and left carotid angiography revealed a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> arising from the left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy, the second angiography showed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to be clearly enlarged, so it was resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient complained of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> a day after the operation and CT scan revealed a new infarction in the right frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The third angiography showed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> arising from the right middle cerebral artery and the fact that two peripheral arteries of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had disappeared 3 weeks after the first operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second operation was performed and a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient left the hospital without any neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Septic embolism is the most important complication of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and it is usually presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> caused by ruptured <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this case the septic embolism occurred two times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At each time cerebral ischemic attacks were presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reason why this case presented with ischemic symptoms was suspected to be that embolisms occurred at the trifurcation of the distal middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We were able to detect a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> angiographically 3 days after the ischemic attack and we suspected that a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had been able to develop within 3 days after the septic embolism </plain></SENT>
