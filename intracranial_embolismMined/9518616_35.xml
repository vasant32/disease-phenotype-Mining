<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the protein production of IL-1beta and the cellular sources of IL-1beta are largely undefined after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have measured the cellular localization of IL-1beta protein in brain tissue from non-ischemic and ischemic mice using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male C57B/6J (n=45) mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion by a clot or a suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mice were sacrificed at time points spanning the period from 15 min to 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-operated and sham-operated mice were used as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal anti-IL-1beta antibody was used to detect IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the non-operated and sham-operated mice, a few IL-1beta immunoreactive cells were detected scattered throughout both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-1beta immunoreactive cells increased in the ischemic lesion as early as 15 min and peaked at 1 h to 2 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IL-1beta immunoreactivity was detected in the cortex of the contralateral hemisphere 1 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, IL-1beta immunoreactivity was mainly present adjacent to the ischemic lesion and in the non-ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IL-1beta immunoreactivity was found on endothelial cells and microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates an early bilateral expression of IL-1beta on endothelium after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in mice </plain></SENT>
