<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of cranial base strategies and principles has added to surgical management options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors used one of four cranial base approaches for the treatment of 30 patients with large and/or complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arising from the vertebrobasilar circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These approaches included the extradural temporopolar, combined petrosal, retrolabyrinthine-transsigmoid, and the extreme-lateral inferior transtubercular exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indications, technique, and results of each approach in this series are discussed, and a management paradigm is suggested for such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
