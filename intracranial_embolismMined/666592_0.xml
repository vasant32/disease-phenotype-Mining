<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occlusion of the peripheral supply artery in the brain in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was found to be due to thromboemboli generated from focal thrombotic lesions situated proximally in the aorta and elastic arterial trunks arising from it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These central thrombotic lesions were caused by a transient form of focal aortoarteritis that primarily affects medial elastic tissue underlying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
