<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The main factor limiting endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> is the shape of the aneurysmal sac, particularly the width of the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we present a new technique to occlude wide neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that involves the temporary inflation of a non-detachable balloon in front of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck during each coil placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to present the feasibility, efficacy and safety of this "remodeling technique" (RT) as compared to that of "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" GDC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: 56 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 54 patients were selected for treatment with the RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven (70%) of the patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five (45%) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were located at the vertebrobasilar artery, 24 (43%) at the internal carotid artery, and seven at the level of smaller arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment was achieved in 52 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> which were initially not completely occluded underwent a second treatment using the RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Final results (i.e. the last follow-up angiography or results at the end of the treatment for the cases that have not yet had follow-up) consisted of total occlusion in 40 cases (77%), sub-total occlusion in nine cases (17%), and incomplete occlusion in three cases (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiographic evidence of clotting was observed during the procedure in three cases, resulting in one permanent deficit (quadranopia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rupture of the aneurysmal sac occurred during the procedure in three cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were asymptomatic in the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, morbidity due to the technique was 1/52 (0.5%) and mortality was 0/56 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The remodeling technique allowed the treatment of 52 wide neck or badly shaped <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that were not treatable without this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results of occlusion with the RT seem better than those in our series of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GDC treatment, and complications related to the technique are fewer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This technique thereby extends the spectrum of treatable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> without increasing the risk incurred by treatment </plain></SENT>
