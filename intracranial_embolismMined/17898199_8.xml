<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) emboli may occur before or during fibrinolytic revascularization of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and internal carotid artery (ICA) T occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the incidence and effect of baseline and new embolic ACA occlusions in the Interventional Management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (IMS) studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case report forms, pretreatment and posttreatment arteriograms, and CTs from 142 subjects entered into IMS I &amp; II were reviewed to identify subjects with baseline ACA occlusion, new ACA emboli occurring during fibrinolysis, subsequent CT-demonstrated infarction in the ACA distribution, and to evaluate global and lower extremity motor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During M1/M2 thrombolysis procedures, new ACA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> occurred in 1 of 60 (1.7%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline distal emboli were identified in 3 of 20 (15%) T occlusions before intra-arterial (IA) treatment, and new posttreatment distal ACA emboli were identified in 3 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, 8 (32%) T occlusions demonstrated CT-ACA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, typically of small volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were less common following sonography microcatheter-assisted thrombolysis compared with standard microcatheter thrombolysis (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0007340'>Lower extremity weakness</z:hpo> was present in 9 of 10 subjects with ACA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The modified Rankin 0 to 2 outcomes were achieved in 4 of 25 (16%) subjects with T occlusion overall, but in 0 of 10 subjects with distal ACA emboli or ACA CT <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With IV/IA recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> emboli, new ACA emboli are uncommon events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Distal ACA emboli during T-occlusion thrombolysis are not uncommon, typically lead to small ACA-distribution <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and may limit neurologic recovery </plain></SENT>
