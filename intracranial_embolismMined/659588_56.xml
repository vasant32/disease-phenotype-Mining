<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A patient who suffered a recurring <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> over the last 15 yr has been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The only abnormality found in this patient was a significantly depressed level of plasminogen activity in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spite of the depressed plasminogen activity, the patient was found to have a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of plasminogen antigen concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was calculated that the activity per milligram of plasminogen of the patient was approximately one-half the values of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same discrepancy between biological activity and antigen concentration was found in the other members of the kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A niece was found to have practically no plasminogen activity but possessed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> concentration of plasminogen antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both her parents were found to have approximately half the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasminogen activity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antigen levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies suggested that the molecular abnormality was inherited as an autosomal characteristic, and the family members who had half the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of activity with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasminogen antigen were heterozygotes whereas the one with practically no plasminogen activity was homozygote </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequent studies showed that the pattern of gel electrofocusing of purified plasminogen of the heterozygotes consisted of 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bands and 10 additional abnormal bands, each of which had a slightly higher isoelectric point than each corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This indicates that plasminogen of the heterozygote is a mixture of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal molecules in an approximately equal amount, which was substantiated by active site titration of purified plasminogen preparations obtained from the propositus and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The gel electrofocusing pattern of the homozygote consisted of abnormal bands only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The defect is a hereditary abnormality of plasminogen </plain></SENT>
