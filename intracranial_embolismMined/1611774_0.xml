<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (21%) subjects had wedge-shaped lesions including cerebral cortex (the cortical type), 65 (79%) had them predominantly in white matter and/or territory of the deep perforators (the subcortical type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty nine cases out of total 82 (72%:9 in the cortical type, 50 in the subcortical type) had the silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the contralateral hemisphere to the affected side found on the 1.5 tesla superconductive system T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 57 had the contralateral small cortical and/or subcortical (white matter) infarction, the other 2 cases had the contralateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in the basal ganglia-internal capsule area as the silent lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of the cortical type was high in cases without the silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It might be suspected that the cortical type had tendency to present clinical symptoms caused by initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without prior silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The author proposed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> might play an important role in showing the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> clinical symptoms of the cortical type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And the author also proposed that there might be a difference in the development of clinical symptoms between the silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> located in the basal ganglia-internal capsule area and the cortical-subcortical (white matter) area </plain></SENT>
