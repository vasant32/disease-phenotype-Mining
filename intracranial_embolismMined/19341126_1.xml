<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI of brain were examined and analysed on seven cases compressed air divers complicated with cerebral arterial gas embolism CAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were some characteristics of cerebral injury: (1) Multiple lesions; (2) larger size; (3) Susceptible to parietal and frontal lobe; (4) Both cortical grey matter and subcortical white matter can be affected; (5) Cerebellum is also the target of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MRI of brain is an sensitive method for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> in compressed air divers in diving accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MRI should be finished on divers in diving accidents within 5 days </plain></SENT>
