<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The measurements were made before and after infusion of tyrosine, the precursor amino acid of the putative <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same observations were made in another experimental group, i.e., before and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral multiembolization induced by microfil emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the steady state CBF was unaltered following reduction of intracranial pressure by removal of CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After infusion of tyrosine, CBF was decreased, and cerebrovascular resistance increased significantly on removal of CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral embolization did not influence changes in CBF at reduced intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It appears that the cerebral resistance vessels constrict following reduction of intracranial pressure by removal of CSF and that cerebrospinal fluid pressure-CBF autoregulatory mechanisms are resistant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by middle cerebral artery embolization </plain></SENT>
