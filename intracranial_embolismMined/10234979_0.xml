<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have had 18 of these cases namely, three in vertebral artery, four in basilar artery, four in internal carotid artery, five in middle cerebral artery, and two in anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were clipped, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were removed with anastomosis, two cases were treated interventionally, and five cases were treated conservatively because of <z:chebi fb="107" ids="46670,9119">serpentine</z:chebi> and fusiform types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in internal carotid artery bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These conservatively treated patients died due to infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When surgery is selected in the thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, the approach is the most important to secure the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography was useful to plan the strategy for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the neck is big enough for placement of a clip, arterial reconstruction is the choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reconstruction must be done including an adequate size of the artery because of the thick wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck is too small to reconstruct, aneurysmectomy with anastomosis is one of the choices </plain></SENT>
