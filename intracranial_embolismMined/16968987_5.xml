<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six open heart surgery <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi> and 26 coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients were evaluated by neuropsychological and transcranial Doppler tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OH was associated with a significantly larger microembolic load in comparison to CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In OH patients, the microembolic load at the left middle cerebral artery correlated with a verbal memory decline, whereas the microembolic load at the right middle cerebral artery correlated with a nonverbal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CABG patients also showed a postoperative verbal memory decline which correlated with cardiopulmonary bypass length but not with microembolic load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Massive microembolic load during OH induces specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in accordance to the brain region to which they are delivered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In atherosclerotic patients, the left temporal region is especially prone to perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
