<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination did not reveal any abnormalities on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her growth and development were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed a high density mass in the pineal region without contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was a spontaneously thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the vein of Galen associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the straight and the transverse sinuses on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there were an interhemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipoma</z:hpo> and a right temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The superior sagittal, bilateral transverse, sigmoid and straight sinuses were not opacified but unusual pathways of various venous channels were demonstrated on angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persistent fetal drainage remained as the collateral venous pathways such as the ventral diencephalic and striate veins and the paired longitudinal head sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were two types of unusual deep venous pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The left internal cerebral vein drained into the left ventral diencephalic vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The left ventral diencephalic vein drained through the left lateral mesencephalic and ponto-medullary veins into the spinal venous plexi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The dilated striate veins drained into the deep middle cerebral veins through the cerebral parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mainly, there were three types of superficial venous pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The paired longitudinal head sinuses drained into the emissary veins at the ethmoid sinus in retrograde fashion, and finally into the nasal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The superficial cerebral veins drained into the cavernous sinus which communicated with the nasal mucosa and the pterygoid plexi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The veins of the posterior fossa drained into the occipital emissary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After being admitted, the patient had remarkable nasal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> which was difficult to stop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This symptom seemed to be related to the collateral venous drainage to the nasal mucosa shown on angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Finally, she became completely asymptomatic three weeks after admission </plain></SENT>
