<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High numbers of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) have been associated with increased risk of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify factors predictive of postoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler monitoring of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was performed for 30 minutes during the first postoperative hour in sequential patients undergoing CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stepwise binomial logistic regression analysis was performed to identify preoperative and intraoperative variables that predicted the occurrence of postoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 141 patients (mean age, 69 years); 102 (72%) were male, and 69 (49%) had at least 1 MES (range, 1 to 118) detected in the first postoperative hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of postoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was greater in women (P=0.027), patients not receiving antiplatelet therapy (P=0.033), and patients undergoing left-sided CEA (P=0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other variables such as residual stenosis seen on completion angiography and operative technique were not associated with postoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were most likely in women, patients not receiving preoperative antiplatelet therapy, and patients who had a left CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microembolism might explain why these same factors are associated with higher rates of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
