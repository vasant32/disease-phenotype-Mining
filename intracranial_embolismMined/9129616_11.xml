<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The role of continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring during carotid endarterectomy was evaluated in this retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from 902 consecutive carotid endarterectomy procedures performed with vein patch angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 591 operations from 1980 to 1988 we did not use intraoperative EEG monitoring or shunting (non-EEG group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous intraoperative EEG monitoring and selective shunting were used in 311 procedures from 1988 to 1994 (EEG group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients' mean age was higher in the EEG group (68.8 years; range, 41 to 87 years) than in the non-EEG group (66.2 years; range, 34 to 90 years; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a significantly higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (56.2% vs 41.9%) and redo operations (5.4% vs 2.54%) in the EEG group than in the non-EEG group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The operative technique was identical in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We defined a significant EEG change as a greater than 50% reduction of the amplitude of the faster frequencies, a persistent increase of delta activity, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the EEG group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> EEG changes occurred in 40 patients (12.8%); 31 (77.5%) unilateral and ipsilateral to the operated carotid artery, and nine (22.5%) bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In five patients (12.5%) the changes correlated with an intraoperative episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure was restored the EEG returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 35 procedures (87.5%) a carotid shunt was inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 33 of those patients the EEG returned to baseline, in one patient there was a significant improvement, and in one patient the EEG changes persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperative hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in one patient (0.32%) in the EEG group and in 13 patients (2.19%) in the non-EEG group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (n = 14) were ipsilateral to the operated carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the non-EEG group nine were major and four were minor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the EEG group was embolic in origin and occurred before carotid cross-clamping; it was associated with profound EEG changes that did not reverse after placement of a shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the total group (n = 902), intraoperative EEG monitoring was inversely associated with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The overall neurologic morbidity rate was significantly lower in the EEG group than in the non-EEG group, therapy demonstrating the value of intraoperative EEG monitoring in carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
