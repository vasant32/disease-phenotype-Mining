<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The index is proportional to total flow, and is obtained from the ratio of regional count rate to arterial indicator input to a region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This index is a more sensitive indicator of impaired perfusion than the traditional flow rate indices which express flow per unit mass of tissue per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It accounts for brain tissue partly or totally deprived of its blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examples of clinical application are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A good correlation with the findings of computer-assisted tomography has been found </plain></SENT>
