<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that even if the site of major <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> is recanalized after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> continues to occur at distal sites, reducing postischemic flow and contributing to ongoing neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, and to show that microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurs as an ongoing, dynamic process after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we tested the effects of a potent antiplatelet agent given both before and after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of middle cerebral arterial (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in a murine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 45 min of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and 23 h of reperfusion, fibrin accumulates in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, based upon immunoblotting, and localizes to microvascular lumena, based upon immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In concordance with these data, there is a nearly threefold increase in the ipsilateral accumulation of 111In-labeled platelets in mice subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with mice not subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When a novel inhibitor of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa receptor (SDZ GPI 562) was administered immediately before <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, platelet accumulation was reduced 48%, and fibrin accumulation was reduced by 47% by immunoblot densitometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GPI 562 exhibited a dose-dependent reduction of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes measured by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining, as well as improvement in postischemic cerebral blood flow, measured by laser doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GPI 562 caused a dose-dependent increase in tail vein <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) was not significantly increased at therapeutic doses; however, there was an increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> at the highest doses tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When given immediately after withdrawal of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occluding suture, GPI 562 was shown to reduce cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes by 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data support the hypothesis that in ischemic regions of brain, microvascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> continue to accumulate even after recanalization of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, contributing to postischemic hypoperfusion and ongoing neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
