<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Victims of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> often recover rapidly on hyperbaric treatment then deteriorate again, even if hyperbaric treatment is continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous animal experiments, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> has been shown to improve recovery of somatosensory evoked response amplitude after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, animals in these experiments rarely deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in canines produces deterioration despite hyperbaric treatment, and we decided to test the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> on somatosensory evoked potential recovery and cerebral blood flow in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Dogs were treated with repeated doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> or equivalent volumes of saline during hyperbaric therapy after internal carotid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The investigators were unaware of treatment group assignment during the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amplitude of the median nerve somatosensory evoked potential and cerebral blood flow measured with <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36927">carbon-14</z:chebi>-labeled iodoantipyrine autoradiography were used to assess effect of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi>-treated dogs recovered 60 +/- 10% (mean +/- 95% confidence limits) of the baseline somatosensory evoked potential amplitude 220 minutes after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>; saline-treated dogs recovered 32 +/- 10% (a significant difference at p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi>-treated dogs also had higher cerebral blood flow values than saline-treated dogs 220 minutes after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> ameliorated the delayed deterioration of evoked potential associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in this canine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improved cerebral blood flow may be a mechanism of action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> or an associated effect of improved neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
