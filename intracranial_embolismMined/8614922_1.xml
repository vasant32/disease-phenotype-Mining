<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study a clinical algorithm for assessing unjustified hospital stay in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients was computerized and tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An algorithm was developed by the authors to estimate the number of medically justified and unjustified hospital days for patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data for the algorithm were obtained from 177 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients from an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-care teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The performance of the algorithm was evaluated on a subset of 46 patients by comparing the number of medically unjustified hospital days determined by the algorithm with the consensus determination of two neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The algorithm classified 68% of the 177 patients as having some unjustified hospital days and 41% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hospital days as unjustified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the neurologists as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the algorithm was .89 and the specificity was .91 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the number of unjustified days determined by the algorithm and the neurologists was .76 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable unjustified length of stay for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physicians can develop simple clinical algorithms for detecting unjustified hospital stay in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients that provide a reasonable approximation of complex clinical judgment </plain></SENT>
