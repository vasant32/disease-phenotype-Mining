<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> in combination with delayed thrombolytic therapy in a rat model of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> at 4 h, followed by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) at 6 or 8 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> at 4 h and tPA at 6 h significantly decreased the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> at the origin of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, improved microvascular patency, and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, but did not increase the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation compared with vehicle-treated control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, monotherapy with tPA at 6 h increased the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation and failed to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, adjuvant treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> at 4 h and with tPA at 6 h reduced tPA-induced upregulation of protease-activated receptor-1, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, and concomitantly reduced cerebral microvascular platelet, neutrophil, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> compared with rats treated with tPA alone at 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> and tPA extended the therapeutic window for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to 6 h without increasing the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> blocked delayed tPA-potentiated adverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebral vascular events</z:hpo>, which likely contributes to the neuroprotective effect of the combination therapy </plain></SENT>
