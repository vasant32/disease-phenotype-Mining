<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treated group of patients was subdivided into three subgroups on the basis of the diastolic blood pressures recorded at the fourth month after randomization as follows: subgroup A, the poorly controlled patients whose diastolic blood pressures were 90 mm Hg or higher, an intermediate subgroup B with diatolic levels of 81 to 89 mm Hg, and subgroup C, the best controlled patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom exhibited diastolic blood pressures of 80 mm Hg or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the incidence of morbid events was slightly higher in subgroup A than in the other subgroups, the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the incidence of morbid events in subgroup A was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than in the untreated control patients (14.9% in subgroup A vs. 28.9% in the control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While normalization of blood pressure is a desirable goal of treatment, even partial reduction appears to exert significant therapeutic benefit </plain></SENT>
