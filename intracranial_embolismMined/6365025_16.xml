<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We defined the pathologic features in 14 cardiac transplants with survival times longer than one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only one heart showed no evidence of rejection, while the remaining 13 hearts showed advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> rejection, which was the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or of graft failure in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient died of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, one of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo>, and one of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most obtrusive change in the donor hearts was an obliterative <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, which in the epicardial coronary arteries mimicked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Superadded <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> often resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These severe vascular lesions bore no constant relationship to survival time and took from 1.1 to 12.5 years to evolve </plain></SENT>
