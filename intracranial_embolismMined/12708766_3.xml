<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic crossclamp manipulation seems to be the most significant cause of emboli release during cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to demonstrate whether the use of an intra-aortic filter device has an effect on the magnet resonance imaging (MRI) and functional neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients undergoing cardiosurgical procedures using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were selected: coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (n = 17), aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery (n = 4) or combined procedures (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated by diffusion weighted MRI of the brain, neurological examination and neuropsychological assessment regarding alertness as well as divided and selective attention before and five to seven days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group I, 12 patients received a filter through a modified 24 F arterial cannula immediately before the aortic crossclamp was released </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Filters remained in the aorta until CPB was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively, bilateral middle cerebral artery transcranial Doppler (TCD) was monitored at baseline, at the beginning of CPB, at a timepoint when the aorta was crossclamped, when the filter was inserted and while the crossclamp was switched to partial clamping until the CPB was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD was used for detection of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The captured material in the filter was examined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients served as controls without aortic filtration (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The MRI of the brain did not show any diffusion alterations in either group before or after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patient developed a focal neurological deficit or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative quantitative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection revealed a four to tenfold increase in patients of group I compared with group II (5-6 versus 0.5-1 MES/min) during the filter dwell time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no consistent pattern regarding the neurobehavioural sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Filters showed arteriosclerotic debris in 75% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The use of the intra-aortic filter device did not show a positive effect on neurological, neuroradiographical and neuropsychological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The increase of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> rate in group I patients may be due to microbubbles generated as microcavitations by the filter or the aortic filter cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The intra-aortic filter was able to capture atheromatous material in 75% of the patients </plain></SENT>
