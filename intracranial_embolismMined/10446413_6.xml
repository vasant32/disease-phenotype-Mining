<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This application of LSCM to study the microvascular circulation in embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was developed as an alternative to autoradiography to measure cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional benefit of LSCM is that it quantitates with great accuracy the structural relationships of the microcirculation to cells and the pathological alterations of the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autoradiography allows only a quantitative analysis of cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, in order to study the microcirculation and its relationship to blood brain barrier damage, the volume of perfused cerebral capillaries was measured by administering two fluorescent plasma markers (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and Evans blue) intravenously to a rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evans blue was administered before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> administered post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 1 min before sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Volumes of plasma perfusion were analyzed by means of a system developed for 3D analysis of fixed and stained serial brain histologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma volumes for the non-ischemic cerebral cortex were 1.00%+/-0.38% while plasma volumes in the caudate/putamen were 0.69%+/-0.17% in good agreement with the previously published values using the autoradiography method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The architecture of the capillaries in the ischemic core showed perfusion of Evans blue but there was no flow of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our work represents a novel application of this technology to investigation of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and identifies its potential to become an important tool for investigation of cerebral pathology </plain></SENT>
