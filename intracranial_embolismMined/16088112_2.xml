<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by a symptomatic high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (CS) is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disturbed balance between the procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity in blood associated with unfavorable hemorheology could render CS symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wanted to assess whether hemostatic and fibrinolytic plasma markers as well as basic indicators of hemorheology differentiate asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with a high-grade CS and whether they are associated with the macroscopic appearance of the plaque and the rate of microembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 92 consecutive consenting patients referred to the neurological or the surgical department of our university teaching hospital for treatment of their high-grade CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected before surgery for determination of prothrombin fragments F1 and 2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity and antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity and antigen, D-dimer, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, fibrinogen, in plasma, and hematocrit in blood, and the patients underwent transcranial Doppler ultrasonology for evaluation of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with symptomatic plaques had higher hematocrit levels (p = 0.04), as well as trends for higher tPA antigen and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> rate (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hematocrit, tPA antigen, and PAI-1 antigen and activity were positively correlated with the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ulceration was more common in symptomatic plaques but did not reflect variables of hemostasis or fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, tPA antigen and hematocrit were risk factors for a symptomatic high-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mediators of fibrinolysis and unfavorable hemorheology may contribute to the development of a symptomatic disease in patients with a high-grade CS </plain></SENT>
