<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of cocaine on brain vasculature of young animals have not been histologically studied in depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we report the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lesions of brain</z:e> capillaries, including the choroid plexus, produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cocaine administration, in adult Wistar rats receiving i.p., 30 mg/kg/day of aqueous cocaine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were sacrificed after several days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination of capillaries from different brain regions and cerebellum was performed using light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 7 days, there were initial signs of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, rupture and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 15 days of treatment small interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> by rupture of the basal membrane of the capillaries was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 30 days of treatment, many capillaries from different areas showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023267" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">fibroid</z:e> endothelial thickening, and wall <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> become evident after 60 days of daily cocaine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In numerous places (cortex, gray nucleus: thalamus, caudate, hippocampus and cerebellum) we observed capillaries with an occluded lumen probably due to <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> after 90 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the latter treatment, capillaries from the choroid plexuses had their lumen dilated and the epithelial cells vacuolated or necrotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of cocaine in rats induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> in part as a result of capillary disruption and subsequent extravasation of erythrocytes to brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
