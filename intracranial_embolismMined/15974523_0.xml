<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Today, infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE) remains a severe illness, with high mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="25427">MAs</z:chebi>) are rare complications of IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For most patients, surgical intervention represents the only hope for radical cure of extracranial <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25427">MAs</z:chebi>, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 238 patients with IE was treated at the authors' center between January 1990 and December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 10 underwent surgical intervention due to peripheral <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25427">MAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concomitant surgery for intracardiac and extracardiac pathology was applied in three patients with native valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> to excise infected material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aneurysmectomy and revascularization were performed in four patients with native <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and in three with prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (PVE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intracardiac pathologies of these seven patients were treated with antimicrobial agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent surgery after completion of three weeks' antibiotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An autologous saphenous vein interposition was performed in eight patients, but in two cases, due to size discrepancy, a polytetraflouroethylene (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) graft was chosen as the initial conduit to achieve arterial continuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Saphenous vein graft rupture occurred in one patient; a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> graft was used to achieve second revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Limb salvage was achieved in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Below-knee <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> was necessary in one patient; this was due to prior embolism of the distal arterial tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients died, one due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and another to rupture of undiagnosed visceral MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients remain alive, without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Complete revascularization should be essential to treat peripheral MA in IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Adequate resection, appropriate parenteral administration of antimicrobial agents and size discrepancy are far more important factors than the type of graft material in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142469" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">suture-line infection</z:e> and vessel or graft rupture </plain></SENT>
