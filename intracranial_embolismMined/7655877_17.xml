<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recording from each artery for 20 min, embolic signals were more common ipsilateral to symptomatic arteries (eight of 38) than ipsilateral to asymptomatic arteries (one of 28, P = 0.04), or than in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> of age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (none of 52, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recording a subgroup of patients revealed that previously embolic-signal negative symptomatic stenoses frequently became embolic-signal positive when recording was repeated on another day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recording periods (mean time: symptomatic 36.2 min, asymptomatic 46.2 min) embolic signals were detected ipsilateral to 13 of 38 symptomatic stenoses but only one of 28 asymptomatic stenoses (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic subjects with embolic signals, median number of signals per hour was three (mean 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One month following carotid endarterectomy embolic signals were not detected except in one patient who continued to experience frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>; in this patient following aspirin both symptoms and embolic signals were abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest asymptomatic embolic signals correlate with clinical risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome studies are required to determine whether embolic signal detection may allow prediction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk and monitoring of the effectiveness of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The technique may also prove useful in studying the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
