<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between carotid plaque characteristics and the occurrence of cerebral microemboli signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) and subsequent ischemic events in patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (ACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Sixty-two asymptomatic patients with 50-99% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> underwent transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring to determine the relationship between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and plaque characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed for 1 year, and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were found in 10/62 of the patients at baseline, and there was a significant difference between the patients with moderate stenosis and those with severe stenosis on the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were more frequently found in patients with irregular and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> plaques than in those with regular (p = 0.028) and/or homogeneous plaques (p = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred more frequently in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> than those without <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was 4/50 in the patients with 50-99% stenosis during 1 year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic patients (with 50-99% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>) with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> presented a significantly increased frequency of severe stenosis, with irregular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> plaques </plain></SENT>
