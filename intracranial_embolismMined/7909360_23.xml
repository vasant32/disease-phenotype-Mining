<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the so-defined neurologically symptomatic group (n = 33 patients), silent microembolic events occurred in 27 subjects (overall mean rate, 14/h +/- 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 56 neurologically asymptomatic patients matched for the degree of ICA stenosis, only nine showed such events (overall mean rate, 0.35/h +/- 1.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 89 patients studied, an individual microembolic event rate &gt; or = 2/h had a positive predictive value of 0.88 for a history of recent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that TCD monitoring can provide reliable paraclinical evidence of "unstable ICA disease." </plain></SENT>
