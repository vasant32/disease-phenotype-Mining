<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Improvements in cardiac surgery mortality and morbidity have focused interest on the neurological injury such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> that may accompany an otherwise successful operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate (1) the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, new ischemic change on MRI, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> after cardiac valve surgery; and (2) the controversial relationship between perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients (26 men; mean [SD] age 62.1 [13.7] years) undergoing intracardiac surgery (7 also with coronary artery bypass grafting) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological, neuropsychological, and MRI examinations were performed 24 hours before surgery and 5 days (MRI and neurology) and 6 weeks (neuropsychology and neurology) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> from baseline was determined using the Reliable Change Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two of 40 (5%) patients had perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 22 of 35 (63%) tested had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in at least one measure (range, 1 to 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 37 participants (43%) with postoperative imaging had new ischemic lesions (range, 1 to 17 lesions) with appearances consistent with cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with, and 35% of those without, postoperative ischemic lesions (P&lt;0.001), and there was an association between the number of abnormal cognitive tests and ischemic burden (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have provided a reliable estimate of the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> at 6 weeks after cardiac valve surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is associated with perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and is more severe with greater ischemic load </plain></SENT>
