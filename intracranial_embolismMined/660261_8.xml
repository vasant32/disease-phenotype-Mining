<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report a technique to precisely localize a fistulous opening in the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient is heparinized and a Prolo catheter is introduced into the internal carotid artery and inflated distal to the approximate site of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heparinization allows the balloon to be inflated long enough to obtain and analyze high-quality angiography film without fear of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> generated by the temporary balloon occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrast material injected through the Prolo catheter proximal to the balloon reveals a small segment of cavernous carotid artery between the inflated balloon distally and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> proximally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The venous structures are now only faintly opacified and cannot obscure the morbid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the exact fistulous tear in the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the balloon is placed exactly opposite to the site of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, a standing, stagnant column of dye forms a cast of the cavernous, petrous, and cervical carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> is localized with this method, it may be obliterated by any therapeutic means preferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the Prolo catheter is used for intraluminal occlusion, then a transfemoral contralateral carotid angiogram is done before the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is reversed to confirm that the balloon has not been placed proxial to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
