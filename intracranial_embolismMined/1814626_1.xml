<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study the thrombolytic effect of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, we characterized cerebral embolization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>[125I]Fibrin clot particles (20-100 microns diameter) were injected twice at an interval of 90 min into the left internal carotid artery of WKYs and SHRSPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After each injection, spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> dissolution was monitored with a gamma-ray detector placed on the head of the embolic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>Embolus</z:mpath> dissolution was spontaneously generated in 15 min after the injection of fibrin clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In WKYs, 21% and 42% of the clots were dissolved 30 and 90 min after the second embolization, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> dissolution in SHRSPs was significantly lower than that of WKYs, indicating that the endogenous fibrinolytic ability of SHRSPs is less potent than that of normotensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intravenous administration of t-PA at doses of 75, 250 and 750 micrograms/kg caused a dose-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> dissolution in SHRSPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, systematically applied t-PA produced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> dissolution without causing systemic plasminogen activation, fibrinogen breakdown or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the intravenous administration of t-PA produces selective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> dissolution without systemic fibrino(geno)lysis in a cerebral embolic SHRSP </plain></SENT>
