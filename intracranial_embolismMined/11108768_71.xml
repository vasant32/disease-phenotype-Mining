<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A potentially dangerous side effect associated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) use is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have focused on developing drugs that could be administered with tPA to reduce the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since recent studies suggest that various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha production and membrane and vessel remodeling after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we investigated whether MMP inhibition affected the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> production in the absence or presence of tPA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We occluded the middle cerebral artery of New Zealand White rabbits with radiolabeled blood clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five minutes after embolization, we administered either the MMP inhibitor BB-94 (30 mg/kg SC) or its vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional groups received BB-94 or vehicle in combination with tPA, administered 60 minutes after embolization (3.3 mg/kg tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 48 hours, the rabbits were killed and brains were removed, immersion fixed for 1 week in 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi>, and then cut into 5-mm coronal sections that were examined for the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> after embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was detected in 24% of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>tPA induced macroscopically visible <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 77% of the tPA-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rabbits treated with BB-94 had an 18% incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (P:&gt;0.05 compared with control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, when the combination of BB-94 and tPA was administered to rabbits, there was only a 41% incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (compared with 77% in the tPA group; P:&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both tPA and BB-94/tPA were similarly effective at lysing clots, at 49% and 35% (P:&lt;0.05), respectively, compared with the 5% rate of lysis in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for a reduction in the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but it did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that MMP inhibition attenuates mechanisms involved in tPA-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This novel form of combination therapy may show promise as a treatment strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
