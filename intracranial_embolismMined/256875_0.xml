<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autopsy yielded a clinically unrecognised, dedifferentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the bronchial system </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This influenced not only the clinical picture and course of the disease to a considerable extent, but also focussed diagnostic attention on these signs to such a degree that the possibility of a masked <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> did not seem to suggest itself </plain></SENT>
