<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Results in three patients with thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebral artery are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> presented as a mass lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On postcontrast computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> demonstrated a patent lumen and intrathrombotic vascular channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients died and were autopsied, and the other patient was successfully treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination revealed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had staged clots, an open lumen, intrathrombotic channels with endothelial lining, and aneurysmal walls with intimal thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that the development of the intrathrombotic capillary channels may be an important factor in the growth of thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> followed by aneurysmectomy appears to be the best treatment for this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
