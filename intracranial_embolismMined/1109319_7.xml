<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report describes a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> as well as left and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo>, resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001396" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Stokes-Adams attacks</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient experienced a return to 1:1 atrioventricular (A-V) conduction with narrow QRS within 48 hours of the attacks and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> never recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological studies three weeks later revealed a narrow QRS, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> H-V interval (36 msec), 1:1 A-V conduction up to an atrial paced rate of 210 beats/min, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> refractory periods with atrial extrastimulus techniques (His-Purkinje system refractory periods less than 370 msec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient died from a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> incurred during diagnostic left heart catheterization two days after electrophysiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postmortem examination revealed calcific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> with calcific impingement upon the pars membranacea resulting in compression of the distal His bundle and marked disruption of the proximal portions of both bundle branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This report documents a major limitation of electrophysiological studies, this limitation being that these studies may be totally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on one occasion in a patient with pathologically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conduction disease, which may become clinically manifest on another occasion </plain></SENT>
