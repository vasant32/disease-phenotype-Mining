<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 1-year period, we collected plasma from 481 consecutive patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attending four different hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood (10 mL) was drawn from each subject into a citrated glass tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma was obtained immediately by centrifugation and was stored at -70 degrees C until use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of IgM and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were measured at room temperature in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (not heat-treated) plasma by standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sera were treated by indirect immunofluorescence on mouse liver and kidney sections for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 481 patients (325 men, 156 women) 16 to 90 years in age (mean age, 61 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies were present in 5 of 481 (1.04%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient was IgG positive and four patients were IgM positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 481 patients, 35 (7.2%) were positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-DNA antibodies were not demonstrable in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of anticardiolipin antibodies in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> population is possibly lower than reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The routine screening of anticardiolipin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> population is of questionable value </plain></SENT>
