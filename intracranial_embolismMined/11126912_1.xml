<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) have been suggested to contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that human PMNs produce a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi>-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolite, 1 6(R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34162">16(R)-HETE</z:chebi>], that modulates their function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was thus of interest to examine this novel mediator in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 16-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36275">HETE</z:chebi> was assessed initially in a variety of human PMN and platelet in vitro assays and subsequently in an established rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 50 rabbits completed a randomized, blinded, four-arm study, receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34162">16(R)-HETE</z:chebi>, tissue plasminogen activator, both, or neither </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments were completed 7 hours after autologous clot embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary end point for efficacy was the suppression of increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In in vitro assays, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34162">16(R)-HETE</z:chebi> selectively inhibited human PMN <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and aggregation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> model, animals that received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34162">16(R)-HETE</z:chebi> demonstrated significant suppression of increased ICP (7.7 +/- 1.2 to 13.1 +/- 2.7 mm Hg, baseline versus final 7-h time point, mean +/- standard error), compared with either the vehicle-treated group (7.7 +/- 0.9 to 15.8 +/- 2.6 mm Hg) or the tissue plasminogen activator-treated group (7.6 +/- 0.6 to 13.7 +/- 2.1 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The group that received the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34162">16(R)-HETE</z:chebi> plus tissue plasminogen activator demonstrated no significant change in ICP for the duration of the protocol (8.6 +/- 0.6 to 11.1 +/- 1.2 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34162">16(R)-HETE</z:chebi> suppresses the development of increased ICP in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> and may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy in ischemic and inflammatory pathophysiological states </plain></SENT>
