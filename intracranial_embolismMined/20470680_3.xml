<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is based on historical risks of ACS that no longer pertain in the era of intensive medical therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and other therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the past, the surgical risk of 3% in clinical trials was marginally better than medical therapy for male patients with ACS; however, this is no longer the case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Even in the past, women with ACS did not benefit from endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Except for patients with microemboli on transcranial Doppler (who have a 2-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of approximately 14%), the 2-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in ACS is now 1% or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endarterectomy or stenting should be reserved for the &lt; 5% of patients with microemboli on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In future, 3 dimensional ultrasound detection of ulceration, and magnetic resonance imaging of vulnerable plaque may provide additional approaches to identifying those patients with ACS who may benefit from endarterectomy or stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Routine endarterectomy or stenting for patients with ACS should now be regarded as inappropriate </plain></SENT>
