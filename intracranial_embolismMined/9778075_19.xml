<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a large sample of persons at increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we examined attitudes toward hypothetical major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Respondents were obtained from the Academic Medical Center Consortium (n = 621), the Cardiovascular Health Study (n = 321 ), and United Health Care (n = 319) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preferences were primarily assessed by using the time trade off (TTO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is generally considered an undesirable event (mean TTO = 0.30), responses were varied: although 45% of respondents considered major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to be a worse outcome than <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 15% were willing to trade off little or no survival to avoid a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Providers should speak directly with patients about beliefs, values, and preferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-related interventions, even those with a high price or less than dramatic clinical benefits, are likely to be cost-effective if they prevent an outcome (major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) that is so undesirable </plain></SENT>
