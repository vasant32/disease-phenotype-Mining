<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four served as normothermic controls receiving saline infusion only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 16 rats <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> of 32 degrees C was induced by cooling with a fan, followed by embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were kept hypothermic for the following 3 h before body temperature was raised to 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 26 rats, treatment with human recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (20 mg/kg i.v. during 45 min), started 2 h after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, 14 rats were treated similarly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> for 3 h followed by additional rt-PA treatment starting after 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic therapy reduced median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 19.5% of affected hemisphere among controls to 4.6% (p = 0.006) in the treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to 1.6% (p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional rt-PA could not demonstrate further improvement in this experimental setting </plain></SENT>
