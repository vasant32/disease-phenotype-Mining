<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We describe a method of protecting the distal cerebral circulation during carotid angioplasty and report results using the technique in 17 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven men and five women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> ranging in severity from 70 to 95% underwent the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The technique was used bilaterally in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A compliant <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> balloon was used to occlude the distal internal carotid artery during the angioplasty phase, when the largest number of emboli are generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After angioplasty, debris was then flushed into the external circulation while the occlusion balloon remained inflated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subsequent passage of an exchange guidewire through the angioplasty catheter, with the occlusion balloon deflated, allowed continuous guidewire access across the area of stenosis and facilitated the subsequent placement of a stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The technique was successful in 16 (94%) of 17 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the one patient in whom the occlusion balloon could not be advanced across the stenosis, the patient experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> after subsequent angioplasty that was performed without protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, no complications occurred among the 15 patients undergoing successful, balloon-protected angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inflation times for the occlusion balloon did not exceed 5 minutes in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This method of cerebral protection prevents the intracranial embolization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and atherosclerotic debris, while allowing continuous guidewire access across the site of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The success of this technique and a similar method used by Theron et al. supports the use of balloon protection as a means of reducing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with carotid angioplasty </plain></SENT>
