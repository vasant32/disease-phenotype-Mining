<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We are reporting three cases of histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> of the brain that were angiographically occult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cases presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or attacks of dizziness, and were detected by computed tomography scan, radionuclide scan, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The preoperative diagnosis was granuloma in the first case and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> in the other two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After surgical exploration, biopsy revealed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A review of 47 cases in the literature is tabulated and etiologies of the angiographically occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The routine use of computed tomography scan and timely, appropriate surgical intervention with the operating microscope for the removal of these deeply situated lesions is necessary for the diagnosis and therapy </plain></SENT>
