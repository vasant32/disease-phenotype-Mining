<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This could result in a decrease in activation of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly assigned to a centrifugal or a roller pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of TF, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), and prothrombin fragments F1 + 2 were investigated before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>Embolus</z:mpath> detection was performed at the arterial line of CPB and transcranially by Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The centrifugal pump group revealed a lower TF release (area under the curve during CPB) when compared with the roller pump group [5661 (696-10359) vs 12681 (6383-17538) microg x min/l; median (lower - upper quartiles); P = 0.009] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TAT and F1 + 2 formation did not differ between the groups, and neither did the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> count of both Doppler systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>Embolus</z:mpath> counts did not correlate with TAT or F1 + 2 formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the reduction in TF release by the application of a centrifugal pump seems to have little consequence on total thrombin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since the applied Doppler systems seem to detect mainly microbubbles, conclusions regarding differences between the two pumps in the formation of thrombofibrinous clots cannot be drawn </plain></SENT>
