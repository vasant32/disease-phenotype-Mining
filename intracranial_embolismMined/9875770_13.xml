<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring can detect cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to identify the pattern of microembolic phenomena during various stages of coronary artery bypass grafting, to verify whether numbers of high-intensity transient signals correlated with early neuropsychologic deficits, and to identify, using magnetic resonance imaging scans, whether radiologic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> correlated with microembolic numbers during the bypass period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-one consecutive patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting with transcranial Doppler monitoring were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging brain scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of 32 patients were studied by comparing microembolic load and early neuropsychological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transcranial Doppler monitoring confirmed that most microemboli occurred during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant early neuropsychological deficit after coronary artery bypass grafting did correspond to the total microembolic load during bypass (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on magnetic resonance imaging had significantly more microembolic signal during the preincision phases and not during the bypass period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microembolic load during bypass is associated with early neuropsychologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients who show evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> during coronary artery bypass grafting have a higher microembolic load during the preincision phase than those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Differing mechanisms may be responsible for these different outcomes </plain></SENT>
