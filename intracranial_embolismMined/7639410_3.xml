<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome has been unpredictable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors sought to test the hypothesis that intrathrombus administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) would improve recanalization rate and to assess the possibility that clinical outcome would be predicted by the extent of collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusion</z:e> (less than six hours in 6, twenty-four hours in 1) were treated with intrathrombus rt-PA at 1 mg/minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examinations were scored on a five-point motor scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow was assessed angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vessels recanalized in 5 patients, 3 of whom had good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vessels failed to recanalize in 2 patients, 1 of whom had good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Good collateral flow was evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 patients with good outcome and in none of those with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intrathrombus administration of rt-PA is technically feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Favorable clinical outcome is more likely in the presence of good collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the absence of good collateral flow, ultra-early intervention may be necessary </plain></SENT>
