<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two recent cases suggest that hyperbaric oxygen may be an important adjunct to the surgical treatment of occlusion of major cerebral arteries within the first few hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both patients, one with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> to the right middle cerebral artery and one with a surgical occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, circulation to the ischemic area was restored more than eight hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patient with the middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> cleared after a six-minute exposure to hyperbaric oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient with occlusion of the internal carotid artery was revascularized by anastomosis of a superficial temporal artery less than 1 mm in diameter to a branch of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> cleared rapidly and concomitantly with intermittent exposure to hyperbaric oxygen during the first nine postoperative days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiograms demonstrated patency in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The implications of these observations are discussed </plain></SENT>
