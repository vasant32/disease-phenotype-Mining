<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to relate the outcome after local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) to the natural course in middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 40 patients with a dense middle cerebral artery on early CT; 20 were treated with LIF within 6 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, 20 received "conventional" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dense middle cerebral artery, which is regarded as a highly specific indicator of thromboembolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, was chosen as inclusion criterion since patients with "conventional" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy were not exposed to cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with LIF had a significantly better outcome using the Barthel index (P = 0.025): there was a 30% increase in the proportion of patients with minimal or no disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality, however, did not differ significantly (P = 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two fatal haemorrhages occurred in the LIF group, and one haemorrhagic transformation in the "conventional" group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leptomeningeal collateralisation correlated significantly with outcome in the LIF group (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the relation between outcome and interval from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to LIF was not significant (P = 0.74), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated within 3 h had an excellent outcome </plain></SENT>
