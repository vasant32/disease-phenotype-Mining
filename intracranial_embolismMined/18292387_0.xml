<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and composition of cerebral microemboli in a prosthetic heart valve population and to correlate these findings to cerebrovascular symptoms, blood <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and coagulation parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-six consecutive patients with a total of 81 prosthetic (54 mechanical, 27 biologic) heart valves were monitored for cerebral microemboli by multifrequency transcranial Doppler ultrasonography 1 year after valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular events in the first year were recorded by a neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> and coagulation markers were measured by immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microemboli were detected in mechanical heart valve patients only (28 patients, 56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve percent were solid, occurring in 17 (34%) of the mechanical heart valve population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of solid cerebral microemboli was the only variable that was associated with cerebrovascular symptoms after a final regression analysis (P=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The plasma monocyte chemotactic protein-1 level was raised in patients with solid microemboli (P=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Solid cerebral microemboli were detected by multifrequency transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in 35% of a mechanical heart valve population, and the frequency was higher in patients who experienced cerebrovascular events during the first year after valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the detection of solid cerebral microemboli may be helpful in predicting the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in mechanical heart valve patients </plain></SENT>
