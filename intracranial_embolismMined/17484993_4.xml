<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LAWV at the posterobasal LA wall was measured by transthoracic tissue Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LAWV was lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was more correlated with LA appendage velocity (r = 0.81) and fractional shortening (r = 0.85) than with parameters related to mitral inflow velocity or ring motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a LAWV cut-off value of 1.0 cm/s, receiver operator characteristic analysis curve showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 80% in the identification of patients with spontaneous echocontrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 8 patients with LAWV &lt; or = 1.0 cm/s, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was evident in 3 and LA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in 2, whereas the patients with LAWV greater than 1.0 cm/s had neither </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LAWV may be useful to evaluate LA function and risk of embolism </plain></SENT>
