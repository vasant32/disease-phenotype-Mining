<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a total of 139 acetazolamide tests using 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT in 76 patients with occlusion or greater than 75% stenosis of the carotid or middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduced vasodilatory capacity was demonstrated in 34 patients (44.7%) at entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> test, i.e., impaired and non-impaired group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were prospectively followed for 28.4 +/- 15.9 (Mean +/- S.D.) months and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> tests were repeated every 1-2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> tests demonstrated normalization of impaired vasodilatory capacity in 14 patients, including 12 without surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival analysis comparing the two groups for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and for ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> did not demonstrate the poor prognosis of imparied group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was found in 4 out of 8 cases without improvement of vasodilatory capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present data indicate that the sequential evaluation of vasodilatory capacity is of importance in the clinical management of patients with major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
