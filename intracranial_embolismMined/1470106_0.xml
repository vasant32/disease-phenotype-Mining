<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To predict the late result of percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PMV</z:e>), we studied long term outcome of CMC which is similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PMV</z:e> in terms of closed heart technic, comparing with those of OMC and MVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>226 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>117 patients had CMC, 72 had OMC and 37 had MVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative follow up period in these groups were 1892 patient year, 632 patient year and 200 patient year respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative actual survival rate at 5, 10, 15 years in CMC patients were 95 +/- 2%, 91 +/- 3%, 86 +/- 3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No operative or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was seen in OMC or MVR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative event free rate at 10 years in OMC or MVR patients (97 +/- 2%, 90 +/- 6%, respectively) were higher than that in CMC patients (79 +/- 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> developed in 7 (6%) CMC patients, and 4 of these patients died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient in OMC or MVR group had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was done for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340361" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral restenosis</z:e> or regurgitation in 40 CMC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>15 (38%) of these patients were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, and 22 (55%) patients had secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, only 1 OMC patient and 1 MVR patient had reoperation due to restenosis or thrombosed artificial valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PMV</z:e> should be indicated for restricted cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
