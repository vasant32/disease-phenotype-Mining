<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The advantages of Inoue-Balloon are 1) large diameter (30mm-24mm) with low profile (4.5mm), 2) easy balloon placement, 3) non-slip during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, 4) adjustability of diameter, 5) quick inflation and deflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 1982 to 1988, PTMC were performed in 512 pts by using Inoue-Balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contra-indication for PTMC are Combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> of 3/4 or more and fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No patients died during PTMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complication included 2 (0.4%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e>, 11 (2%) severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PTMC resulted in increase of mitral valve area from 1.13 +/- 0.02 cm2 to 1.97 +/- 0.04 cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The statistic analysis using unpaired t test identified that the increased MVA is significantly larger in pliable valve than in non pliable valve (p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased MVA is also significantly affected by the following conditions; subvalvular lesion (p less than 0.02), previous surgical mitral commissurotomy (0.0007), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence of resultant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> is significantly higher in thickened commissure than in non-thickened commissure (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, this is also higher in the pre-MVA under 1 cm2 than in those over 1 cm2 (p less than 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between balloon size and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The optimal sizes of the balloon for the PTMC are 27 or 28 mm in diameter for an average Asian patient, and 28 to 30 mm for the European patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
