<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microembolization from ulcerated atheroma during carotid dissection also offers a logical explanation for the incidence of intraoperative neurologic deficits during carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of intraoperative embolization is obvious when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> are macroscopic; but focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> associated with atheroma that appear smooth and nonulcerated usually has been attributed to decreased regional cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several endarterectomy specimens were submitted for scanning electron microscopic evaluation using X20 through X4,000 malignification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that carotid atheroma may contain superficial ulcerations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> that are not appreciated by direct inspection or conventional microscopic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic ulcerations and intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> may be responsible for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and intraoperative neurologic deficits in patients in whom gross ulcerations are absent </plain></SENT>
