<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we determined the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, MVP and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in patients with suspected embolic cerebral events after exclusion of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 164 consecutive patients with suspected embolic cerebral events as suggested by cranial computer tomography or clinical neurological examination were divided into two groups: patients with "classical" potential cardiac source of embolism (group I, n = 81, age 52 +/- 10 years) and patients without such potential cardiac sources of embolism (group II, n = 83, age 56 +/- 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, but not that of MVP and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, was significantly higher in group I than in group II (group I: 33.3% vs. group II: 2.4%; chi-square 88.5, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the absence of "classical" potential cardiac sources of embolism transesophageal echocardiography reveals a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in approximately 30% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> as a potential cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
