<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The morphological examination and clinico-anatomical analysis showed that the degree of obstruction of lung microcirculatory bed was of substantial significance for the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravascular coagulation (IC) was found in 11 (84.6%) of women with AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lungs were damaged by microthrombi most frequently and most severely, which was connected with direct contact activation of blood clotting system by the amniotic fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Characteristic peculiarities of AE were their jerk-like course with subclinical period of various duration and early secondary activation of the fibrinolytic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The morphological sign of the latter was the presence of hyaline globules even within the first hour since the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AE </plain></SENT>
