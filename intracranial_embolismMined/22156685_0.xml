<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unclear whether patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> with an ABCD(2) score &lt;4 can be safely evaluated within the following week as recommended by some national guidelines rather than in emergency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1679 patients in the SOS-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> prospective cohort had a definite or possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and had complete information on ABCD(2) score components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were evaluated and treated as soon as possible in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> clinic with round-the-clock access, 87% of them within 24 hours of the first call to medical attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Criteria for emergency treatment were internal carotid or intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> ≥50% or major cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary end point was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 90-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate (number of events/number of patients) was 3.4% (24/701) in patients with ABCD(2) score ≥4, 3.9% (7/180) in patients with ABCD(2) score &lt;4 and criteria for emergency treatment, and 0.4% (3/798) in patients with ABCD(2) score &lt;4 and no criteria for emergency treatment (P for between-group comparison &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When possible, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> should be evaluated without delay regardless of ABCD(2) score because some with lower scores have treatable causes associated with higher short-term risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
