<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, the different factors that are associated with the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and the association between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and outcomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients investigated within 6 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included unselected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who underwent microemboli-monitoring within six hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microemboli-monitoring of both middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was done for a period of 1 hour using 2-MHz probes applied over the trans-temporal window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, predictors for the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and the association between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and various outcome factors were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of either ipsilateral or contralateral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were 25% (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predictors for the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were older age (OR 9; p = 0.03), higher NIHSS (OR 28; p = 0.02), intracranial stenosis (OR 10; p = 0.04) and embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and cardioembolism on TOAST classification) (OR 7; p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were not independently associated with short-term functional outcome, long-term mortality or future vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> are moderately frequent following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microemboli-monitoring helps to better classify the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the presence <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> did not have any prognostic significance in this study </plain></SENT>
