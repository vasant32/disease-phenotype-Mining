<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler may be used to detect spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> (SCE), but this information will only identify at-risk patients if these individuals are consistently identified over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the consistency of SCE production in patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial Doppler signals from the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery in 25 patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of &gt;70% were recorded over 1 hour for blind analysis by a panel of trained observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was repeated at the same time of day, weekly, for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of patients with SCE increased with each week of monitoring until 13 (52%) were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The range of the cumulative number of SCE was 1 to 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten (40%) patients were positive for SCE during only 1 monitoring session, and 2 (8%) were positive for SCE during 2 sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SCE-positive patients tended to have more recent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficients between time elapsed since last cerebral symptom and SCE were weak and not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most, if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> will eventually produce SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the production of an SCE is random, and it is likely that many hours of monitoring are required to determine whether a patient with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> is SCE positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SCE are unlikely to identify at-risk patients but may indicate periods of transiently increased risk in individual patients </plain></SENT>
