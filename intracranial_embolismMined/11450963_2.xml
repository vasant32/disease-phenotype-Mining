<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">Silicone</z:chebi> models of the neurovasculature were attached to a systodiastolic pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stents were placed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> by using the distal flow protection technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolic material was released within the stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of different irrigation techniques was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo> under the balloon through the guiding catheter with a 60-mL syringe followed by one power injection at 40 mL injected at 2 mL/sec will result in removal of about 98% of potential emboli from the internal carotid artery [corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In vitro evaluation of the distal flow protection technique indicates that it should reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk during carotid stent placement </plain></SENT>
