<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The efficacy and pitfalls of endovascular recanalization were evaluated in cases of internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen cases (15 lesions) of symptomatic ICA occlusion with hemodynamic compromise or recurrent symptoms were treated at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage using an endovascular technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Parodi embolic protection system was used during the recanalization procedure to prevent embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by reversing the flow from the distal ICA to the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization of the occluded ICA was possible in 14 of 15 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occlusion points were 10 cervical ICAs and 4 petrous/cavernous ICAs in successfully recanalized cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic symptoms disappeared completely after the treatment, and new ischemic symptoms did not appear related to the treated lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography findings demonstrated the improvement of hemodynamic compromise in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case showed right middle cerebral artery branch occlusion during the procedure, but this patient's neurological symptoms were stable due to preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endovascular recanalization was possible and effective in improving hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there are still several problems with this technique, such as hyperperfusion syndrome after recanalization, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during treatment, durability after treatment, and identification of the occlusion point before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular recanalization using an embolic protection device can be considered as an alternative treatment for symptomatic ICA occlusion with hemodynamic compromise or refractoriness to antiplatelet therapy, even in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of the illness </plain></SENT>
