<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controls were two other series of carotid endarterectomies (group II, n = 60, and group III, n = 60) comprising <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 120 carotid endarterectomies carried out by other trained vascular surgeons in the same hospital during the years 1976-1984 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the first 30 postoperative days there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand there were three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in group II and four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of cerebral complications in carotid endarterectomy was significantly less in the study group than in the control groups, and thus it was possible to reduce the perioperative complications in carotid endarterectomy possibly by pre- and postoperative drug treatment and routine intraoperative heparinization </plain></SENT>
