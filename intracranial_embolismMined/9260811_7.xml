<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with refractory duodenal variceal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> treated with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, as well as coil embolization, who subsequently developed bilateral cerebral and cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> consistent with arterial emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This complication has not been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was found to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> and a right to left intracardiac shunt leading to paradoxical embolization of clots traveling from portal to systemic venous circulation, then to the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the relative frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> in the population, our observation has potential importance for patients with right to left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001693'>cardiac shunts</z:hpo> who are being considered for portosystemic shunt procedures, or who are undergoing embolization of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
