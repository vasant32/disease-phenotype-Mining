<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study determined if alterations in temperature and/or PaCO2 can reduce cerebral and ocular embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-four pigs underwent CPB: 24 animals at 28 degrees C, and 20 at 38 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two temperature groups were randomized to undergo embolization (67-microm fluorescent microspheres) at either hypercarbia or hypocarbia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before and after embolization, cerebral and ocular blood flow were determined at normocarbia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reducing temperature or PaCO2 reduced cerebral and ocular embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypocarbia reduced cerebral embolization by 60% and 45% in normothermic and hypothermic groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to normothermic animals, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> reduced cerebral embolization by 37% under an elevated <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> condition (p &lt; 0.05), but not under hypocarbic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, regardless of temperature, fewer emboli were delivered to the eye in hypocarbic animals (p &lt; 0.05), but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> did not reduce ocular embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral embolization is determined by both temperature and PaCO2 at the time of embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In CPB practice, reductions in temperature and/or PaCO2 during periods of embolic risk may reduce brain injury </plain></SENT>
