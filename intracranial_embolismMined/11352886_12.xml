<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasound can detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> noninvasively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such embolic signals are common after carotid endarterectomy, and their frequency predicts risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used this situation to determine the antiplatelet efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">S-nitrosoglutathione</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi>), a physiological <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi> with possible platelet specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods and RESULTS:Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were randomized in a double-blind manner between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (n=14), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> (n=14), or placebo (n=14) administered intravenously for 90 minutes, starting 30 minutes after skin closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were pretreated with aspirin and given <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler recordings were made from the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery for 4 hours after surgery, beginning 30 minutes after skin closure, and also at 6 and 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were highly significant reductions in the number of Doppler embolic signals in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> groups; first 4 hours, median (range) number of embolic signals, placebo 44.7 (6 to 778), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> 9.5 (0 to 225), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> 0.8 (0 to 8), both P&lt;0.001 versus control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the signals persisted at the 24-hour recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi> attenuate Doppler embolic signals in humans </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the potential application of ultrasonic embolic signal detection to examine the efficacy of new antiplatelet agents in relatively small numbers of patients </plain></SENT>
