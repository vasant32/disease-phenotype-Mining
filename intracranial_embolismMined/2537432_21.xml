<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify microanatomic and chemical features that may mark the transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid lesions, we evaluated 62 carotid artery bifurcation plaques including 45 high-grade stenoses removed at endarterectomy and 17 nonstenotic plaques recovered at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphologic features were evaluated on multiple-interval histologic sections and were graded for the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, ulceration, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, lumen surface irregularity, and calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, recent and remote, was found in most of the specimens, and did not discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic stenotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-grade carotid stenotic plaques were associated with a significantly higher incidence of ulceration (53%), <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (49%), and lumen irregularity (78%) when compared to nonstenotic asymptomatic plaques (6%, 0%, and 17%, respectively; p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although these features were more prominent in lesions that produced symptoms, they were present in 80% of the stenotic bifurcations, and did not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic endarterectomy plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between symptomatic and asymptomatic high-grade lesions with respect to collagen, DNA, total cholesterol, fibrinogen, lipase, elastase, or collagenase content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is commonly seen in carotid plaques even without severe stenosis, and it does not appear to be a dominant determinant of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ulceration and surface <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> that may lead to cerebral embolization are prominent features in markedly stenotic plaques even when symptoms are absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disruptive processes that underlie plaque instability appear to be closely associated with plaque size and stenosis rather than plaque composition </plain></SENT>
