<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral embolism</z:e> is the first cause of neurologic complications of carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A large debate has been raised to identify the caseload necessary for an appropriate learning curve before systematic use of CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined (1) the timing of periprocedural complications during CAS and how these complications vary over time to identify factors that contribute to neurologic morbidity and (2) a sufficient number of procedures for adequate training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 2001 to 2006, 627 CAS procedures with cerebral protection devices (CPD) were performed in a single vascular surgery center by a team including a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These represented 38% of a total of 1598 carotid revascularizations performed in the same interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAS procedures were divided into two groups according to time interval: the first period, 2001 to 2003, included 195 CAS procedures, and the second period, 2004 to 2006, included 432 CAS procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During each CAS procedure, five major steps were considered: phase 1, or the catheterization phase, included the passage of the aortic arch, catheterization of the target vessel, and introduction of a guiding catheter or sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phase 2, or the crossing stenosis phase, included the placement of a CPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phase 3, or the stent ballooning phase, included predilation (when indicated), stent implantation, postdilation, and recovery of the protection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Phase 4, or the early postinterventional phase, included the first 24 hours after leaving the catheterization table </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Phase 5, or the late postinterventional phase, included the interval from the first postoperative day to 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 30 days, 10 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2 of which were fatal) and 1 cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred, for an overall major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of 1.75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 18 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2.9%) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>By analyzing the occurrence of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> according to the three intraprocedural phases, four occurred in phase 1 and six in phase 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> but one were ischemic; six were ipsilateral, three were contralateral, and one was posterior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred prevalently after the procedure (11 in phase 4, 5 in phase 5, and 1 for phases 1 and 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Comparing the first with the second interval of the study period, the 30-day major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate decreased from 3.1% to 0.9% (P = .047), and the 30-day any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate decreased from 8.2% to 2.7% (P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>According to multivariate analysis, study interval (hazard ratio, 3.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-9.01; P = .005) and age (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.12; P = .05) were significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (4/10) from CAS cannot be prevented by using CPD, because these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occur during catheterization (phase 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This finding, together with the significant decrease in the overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate between the first and the last interval of the study period, enhances the importance of an appropriate learning curve that involves a caseload larger than that generally accepted for credentialing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The noticeable number of postprocedural cerebral embolizations leading to minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and occurring in the early and late postinterventional phases (16/18) is likely due to factors less strictly related to the learning-curve effect, such as stent design and medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Moreover, expertise in selecting material and design of the stents according to different vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, in association with correct medical treatment, may be useful in reducing the number of minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that occur in the later postinterventional phases of CAS </plain></SENT>
