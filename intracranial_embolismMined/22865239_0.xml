<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, however, it is difficult to establish a firm etiological association and the debate about management is ongoing </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contrast transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) in 176 patients; a pulmonary RLS was assumed in 10, and 2 showed both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven (55 %) patients with cardiac RLS underwent interventional treatment, and this was more likely for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as index event, a symptomatic infarction on MRI and a large size of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over 2 years, recurrences occurred at a rate of approximately 1.3 % for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 4.3 % for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, and were especially frequent in patients with pulmonary RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When comparing outcomes in patients with cardiac RLS there was a trend for fewer recurrences with interventional management (closure: four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in four patients vs. medical: three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in nine patients; p = 0.066 for events, p = 0.085 for patients) </plain></SENT>
