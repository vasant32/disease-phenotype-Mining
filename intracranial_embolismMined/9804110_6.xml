<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We assessed the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after early intravenous infusion of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rht-PA) in a newly developed rat cerebral embolic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats (n=60) were subjected to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion by a single fibrin rich clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hour after embolization, rats were assigned to the following groups: (1) rht-PA treated group (n=20); (2) vehicle treated group (n=20); and (3) saline treated group (n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits, lodgement of a clot at the origin of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, infarction volume and microscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals exhibited moderate to severe neurological deficits 1 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of rht-PA significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced the incidence of lodgement of a clot at the origin of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (30%) compared with the saline treated group (100%) and the vehicle treated group (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant (P&lt;0.05) reduction of percent hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was detected between the saline (33.2+/-3.71%) and the rht-PA groups (19.4+/-3.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was found in the total area of microscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> of the rht-PA (0.05+/-0.02 mm2), the vehicle (0.02+/-0.01 mm2), and the saline (0.03+/-0.02 mm2) treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference of percent hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P=0.08) was observed between the vehicle and the rht-PA treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that treatment with rht-PA reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume without increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in rats with large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> when treatment was initiated at 1 h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of embolization </plain></SENT>
