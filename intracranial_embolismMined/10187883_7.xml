<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>Embolus</z:mpath> detection using transcranial Doppler ultrasound is a useful method for the identification of active embolic sources in cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Automated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection systems have been developed to reduce the time of evaluation in long-term recordings and to provide more "objective" criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the critical conditions of automated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection by means of a trained neural network (EMBotec V5.1 One, STAC GmbH, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and in 11 patients with arterial or cardiac embolic sources, we performed simultaneous recordings from both middle or both posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, we produced 1342 additional artifacts to use the latter as false-positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detection of microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) was done offline from digital audiotapes (1) by an experienced blinded investigator used as a reference and (2) by a trained 3-layer-feed-forward neural network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From the 1342 provoked artifacts the neural network labeled 216 events as microemboli, yielding an artifact rejection of 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In microembolus-positive patients the neural network detected 282 events as emboli, among these 122 signals originating from artifacts; 58 "real" events were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result revealed a sensitivity of 73.4% and a positive predictive value of 56.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The spectral power of the detected artifact signals was 16.5+/-5 dB above background signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> from patients with artificial heart valves had a spectral power of 6.4+/-2.1 dB; however, in patients with other sources of emboli, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> had an averaged energy reflection of 2.7+/-0.9 dB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The neural network is a promising tool for automated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection, the formal algorithm for signal identification is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, extreme signal qualities, eg, strong artifacts, lead to misdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similar to other automated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection systems, good signal quality and verification of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> by an experienced investigator is still mandatory </plain></SENT>
