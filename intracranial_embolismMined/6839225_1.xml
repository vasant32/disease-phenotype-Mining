<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An accurate recommendation for the timing of anticoagulation following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> hinges on balancing the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> into infarction against the benefits of early treatment attributed to preventing recurrent embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is felt that the present literature, concepts of pathogenesis and experimental data provide insufficient information to make absolute clinical decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The available evidence implies that the risk of further embolic events is three to four times that of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> into infarction, yet additional randomized prospective studies and better experimental models are needed to establish a valid treatment plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It may be possible to distinguish separate mechanisms underlying early diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> into infarction from sudden delayed massive <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> formation </plain></SENT>
