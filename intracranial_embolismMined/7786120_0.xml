<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Framingham study showed the risk of an ischaemic cerebral event to be increased by 5.6 in AF unrelated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> and by 17.5 when AF is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other high risk conditions include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> and cases with echocardiographic changes: left atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, pre-thrombotic state or intra-atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, atheroma of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This stratification of risk should be taken into account when deciding on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conscious of the importance of the risk of embolism in AF, several authors have undertaken, over the last few years, randomised studies of the prevention of thromboembolic complications of AF: the AFASAK, BAATAF, SPAF and SPINAF trials </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A more recent study (SPAF II) confirmed the value of aspirin at the dosage of 325 mg/day which would seem to be a good alternative to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy when this is contraindicated, although aspirin is less effective </plain></SENT>
