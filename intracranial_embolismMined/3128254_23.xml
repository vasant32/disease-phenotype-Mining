<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the effects of tPA in several models of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and found that neurologic damage was reduced when the drug was administered as late as 45 minutes after cerebral embolic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of therapeutic efficacy of tPA was probably thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drug-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> did not occur when therapy was started within four hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that tPA may be useful for thrombolytic therapy of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> if the drug is administered rapidly after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
