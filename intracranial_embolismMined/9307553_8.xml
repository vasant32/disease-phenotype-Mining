<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemostatic function compared in NVAF patients without prior embolic event (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and control subjects without prior thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and in NVAF patients with prior embolic event and control subjects with prior thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Internal medicine outpatient group practice and anticoagulation clinic in 2 teaching hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 75 NVAF patients (50 without and 25 with prior embolic event) and 42 control patients (31 without and 11 with prior thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) recruited concurrently over 18 months during 1990-91 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: Platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, fibrinogen, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen, factor VIII, fibrin D-dimer, antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, fibrinopeptide A and prothrombin fragment F1+2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical analyses were performed after adjustments for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The NVAF patients without a prior embolic event had significantly higher mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and fibrinogen levels (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.05, respectively) than the control subjects without prior thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 29 NVAF patients not taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (none had had an embolic event) had significantly lower mean protein C and protein S levels (p = 0.012 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) and a significantly higher fibrinopeptide A level (p = 0.03, after exclusion of outliers) than the control subjects without prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The NVAF patients with a prior embolic event had alterations in the hemostatic variables similar to those seen in the control patients with a prior thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latter had significantly higher fibrinogen, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen and factor VIII levels (p = 0.04, 0.002 and 0.002, respectively) and significantly lower protein S levels (p = 0.02) than the control subjects without prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NVAF patients without a history of an embolic event show evidence of a prothrombotic state compared with patients in sinus rhythm who have not had a thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NVAF patients with a history of an embolic event show evidence of a prothrombotic state similar to that of patients in sinus rhythm who have had a thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed to determine whether these abnormalities predict higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in individual NVAF patients </plain></SENT>
