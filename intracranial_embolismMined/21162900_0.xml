<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Totally 172 cases of mechanical valve replacement performed from October 2005 to June 2008 were divided into two groups and then analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> were classified as the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group while those on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> alone were classified as the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operation, anticoagulation, anticoagulation index and associated complications were recorded to compare the effect of anticoagulation between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group: the overall anticoagulation effect was satisfactory except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (n=1, 1.1%) and lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n=1, 1.1%) during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> group: no anticoagulation-related complication was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time to reach stable <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> anticoagulation was shorter than the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group and difference was of significance (8 d±3 d vs 11 d±4 d, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment of potential confounding factors such as age, gender, weight by linear regression analysis, the result showed that, the time to reach stable <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> anticoagulation was shortened than the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group by 2.11 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance of difference was observed between two groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is both safe and effective to anticoagulated the patients after mechanical valve replacement with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
