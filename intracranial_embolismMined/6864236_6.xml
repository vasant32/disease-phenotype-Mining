<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gross pattern of HRP extravasates was studied: (a) after five min of in vivo circulation, (b) following infusion of HRP immediately before chemical fixation, and (c) following infusion of HRP after 60 min of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examination of the material from the three different experimental groups revealed no qualitative differences at the light microscopic level; specific features such as ring-shaped extravasations of HRP occurred irrespective of the mode of tracer injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tracer-filled pinocytotic vesicles and tubular profiles were abundant in the vascular endothelium after in vivo circulation of HRP, but were virtually absent after supravital and postmortem HRP administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown for proteins after microembolization is not an energy-dependent process mediated by either pinocytosis or tubular-endothelial channel formation </plain></SENT>
