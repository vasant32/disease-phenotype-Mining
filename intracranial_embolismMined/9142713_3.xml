<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Fenestrated Fontan procedure (FFP) has improved outcome in high risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique is evolving, however, and complications are not fully known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over a 3-year period 13 patients (mean age 35 +/- 29 months) underwent an FFP in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first two patients the fenestration had to be created because of high right atrial pressure and low cardiac output; in 11 patients the FFP was planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three patients the sutures for the adjustable fenestration were crossing the defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients, purse-string sutures were placed around but not across the defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because large fenestrations were created in 11 patients (8-12 mm) Glenn shunts were performed to improve arterial saturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was relatively uneventful, with chest tubes being removed 1-8 days (mean 4 +/- 3 days) postoperatively and the hospital stay ranging from 7 to 27 days (mean 14 +/- 6 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and another had a mediastinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The first patient died (7.6%) because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> due to prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass from the creation and enlargement of the fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had a paradoxical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> from clots that formed on the sutures crossing the fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because of this problem the remaining patients were placed on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylates</z:chebi> while awaiting closure of their fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients had their fenestrations closed, performed under local anesthesia in 9, at mediastinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> drainage in 1, and spontaneously in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that creation of large fenestrations in combination with Glenn shunts and the use of adjustable fenestrations are viable modifications of the FFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The use of purse-string sutures around the fenestration and antiplatelet drugs can probably minimize the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
