<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Small emboli arising from a friable plaque during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) constitute an important risk of perioperative ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the incidence and significance of silent cerebral ischemic lesions of embolic origin after CEA, we prospectively examined a series of surgical patients with high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> by using diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also tried to correlate postoperative ischemic lesions with the occurrence of sonographic cerebral embolic signals, the presence of plaque ulcerations, and the use of intraoperative shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of a consecutive series of 53 patients undergoing elective CEA for high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, 48 patients with unchanged postoperative neurological status were prospectively studied with DWI of the brain the day before and the day after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnetic resonance images were analyzed by 2 neuroradiologists blinded to the clinical result of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any new hyperintense signal was interpreted as a postoperative ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six (95.8%) of 48 patients had unchanged postoperative brain DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients (4.2%), a new single asymptomatic hyperintense signal was observed on the side of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both lesions were small and presumably of embolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were not related to sonographic embolic signals, plaque ulcerations, or intraoperative shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the incidence of silent ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> of embolic origin after CEA is low and does not correlate with the occurrence of intraoperative sonographic microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They confirm that CEA is a safe procedure that carries a low risk of postoperative cerebral events </plain></SENT>
