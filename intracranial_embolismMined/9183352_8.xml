<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with potential cardiac (n = 300) or carotid (n = 100) embolic source and control subjects (n = 100) were monitored with transcranial Doppler sonography for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic (n = 192) and/or transesophageal (n = 134) echocardiography and carotid studies (continuous-wave Doppler, n = 181; color-coded duplex, n = 47) were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with potential native cardioembolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid disease</z:e> was evaluated by means of continuous-wave Doppler (n = 87), color-coded duplex (n = 70), or intra-arterial angiography (n = 24) in patients with potential carotid embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> prevalence was 23% in patients with potential native cardioembolic source (infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> [n = 7] 43%, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0006698'>ventricular aneurysm</z:hpo> [n = 38] 34%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> [n = 23] 26%, dilative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> [n = 39] 26%, nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> [n = 24] 21%, valvular disease [n = 80] 15%), 55% in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves (mechanical [n = 77] 58%, porcine [n = 7] 43%, homografts [n = 5] 20%), 28% in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> (symptomatic [n = 46] 52%, asymptomatic [n = 54] 7%; P &lt; .01), and 5% in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No relationship between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts and patients' age, sex, or actual medication was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection in identifying patients with potential embolic sources were 31% and 95%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed the reported clinical significance of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> and the high specificity of this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The demonstrated low sensitivity of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection could be due to short monitoring duration or application of antihemostatic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective large-scale studies are needed to determine the definitive value of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> detection as a diagnostic method in patients with potential cardioembolic source </plain></SENT>
