<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three cases have been described illustrating the mechanisms and effects of lesions from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rotation injury to the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These indicate that the portion of artery at risk is in the C1 to C2 region, where stretching and shearing strains can produce intramural dissection and haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such changes can radically alter flow to produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> arterial obliteration or later <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such alteration can also produce a change in relationships between artery and surrounding structures and thus cause intermittent occlusion of a vertebral artery upon cervical rotation </plain></SENT>
