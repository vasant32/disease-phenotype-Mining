<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are two techniques of performing this procedure, the double balloon and the Inoue techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the immediate complications of percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty in two consecutive series of unselected patients undergoing the double balloon (131 patients) and the Inoue (131 patients) techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two series were comparable before valvuloplasty with respect to demographic, clinical, echocardiographic and haemodynamic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in valvular surface area and the decrease in pressure gradient after valvuloplasty were not significantly different (1.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.95 +/- 0.5 cm2 in the Inoue series and 1.0 +/- 0.2 to 1.95 +/- 0.5 cm2 in the double-balloon series; 12 +/- 3 to 5 +/- 2 mmHg in the Inoue series and 13 +/- 4 to 5 +/- 2 mmHg in the double-balloon series for the mean transvalvular pressure gradient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A good immediate result was defined as a valve surface are &gt; 1.5 cm2 and &lt; or = 2 + <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> after the series, and this was obtained in 78% of cases in both series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (3 +) requiring immediate or elective mitral valve replacement was observed in 7 cases in the Inoue series and in 5 cases in the double-balloon series (NS) </plain></SENT>
