<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the findings of previous studies regarding the relationship between tHcy levels and subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI) have been conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine this issue in a community-based case-control study performed in Hisayama Town in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting tHcy levels were compared among 75 CI cases, of which 43 were lacunar (LI), 24 atherothrombotic (ATI) and 8 cardioembolic infarctions (CEI), and 248 age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean tHcy concentrations were higher in CI than in controls (13.0 vs. 11.8 micromol/l; p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LI and CEI also had significantly higher tHcy levels than did the corresponding controls (12.3 vs. 11.3 micromol/l for LI; p = 0.037 and 16.3 vs. 12.7 micromol/l for CEI; p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same tendency was also observed for ATI, but the difference was only marginally significant probably due to the small number of the cases (13.4 vs. 11.9 micromol/l; p = 0.087) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, total protein, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12) levels, the risk of LI was not significant in the second tertile of the tHcy distribution, but significantly increased in the third compared with the first tertile (adjusted odds ratio, AOR, 3.4; 95% confidence limits, CL, 1.3-8.9; p = 0.015), while the risk of ATI was significant even in the second tertile (AOR, 5.0; 95% CL, 1.0-23.7; p = 0.042) and higher in the third tertile (AOR, 7.5; 95% CL, 1.5-38.3; p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the odds ratios for CEI could not be estimated, as there was no case of CEI in the first tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that elevated tHcy is an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of CI, but that its impact is higher in ATI and probably in CEI than in LI </plain></SENT>
