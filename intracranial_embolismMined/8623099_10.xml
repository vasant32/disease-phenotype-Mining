<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is a major contributor to total morbidity and mortality in older individuals, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relatively few data exist on whether this relationship changes with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To examine age-related changes in the relationships between risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, we examined the 6-year incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among men aged 45 to 81 years using updated blood pressure data from three examinations of Japanese-American men from the Honolulu Heart Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (systolic blood pressure &gt; or = 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; or = 95 mm Hg or the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication) and the 6-year incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increased significantly with increasing age (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> incidence with age was more marked in those who were normotensive at baseline (2.7/1000 in those aged 45 to 54 years to 23.9/1000 in those &gt; or = 65 years; P &lt; .001) than in hypertensive men (20.6/1000 in those aged 45 to 54 years to 33.5/1000 in those &gt; or = 65 years; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-related increase in risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> among normotensive men resulted in a decrease in the percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (50% in those aged 45 to 54 years to 18% in those &gt; or = 65 years; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar trends were seen for hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no age-related changes in the relationships of other major atherosclerotic risk factors with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> relationships were present after multivariate adjustment for age, smoking, cholesterol, and other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In view of the greater prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and the proven efficacy of treatment in the elderly, these findings do not negate the value of aggressive screening and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in this age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it appears that other unidentified factors have an increasing role in the causation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with advancing age </plain></SENT>
