<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether intracerebral distribution of clot emboli can induce perfusion deficits and ischemic brain injury in a rat embolism model, diffusion/perfusion magnetic resonance imaging techniques were employed using a 4.7 Tesla imager </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clot emboli produced from venous blood were injected into the right internal carotid artery of male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted spin-echo imaging was used to detect early ischemic injuries due to cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> every 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequential echo-planar imaging (EPI), as a form of perfusion imaging, was carried out following bolus i.v. injection of the magnetic susceptibility contrast agent Dy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-BMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Images (EPI) were also made during clot embolization to localize the distribution of the emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The images obtained showed signal loss in the right hemisphere corresponding to the distribution of the emboli result of the magnetic susceptibility effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The spatial distribution of the signal loss corresponded to the perfusion deficits, decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> (apparent diffusion coefficient) areas on diffusion images, and histological abnormalities on TTC-stained specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After intra-arterial streptokinase infusion following clot embolization, decreased perfusion deficits and abnormal <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> areas were monitored by diffusion/perfusion MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diffusion/perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging thus provided excellent in vivo mapping of the distribution of the emboli in relation to cerebral perfusion deficits and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic injury in the rat embolism model </plain></SENT>
