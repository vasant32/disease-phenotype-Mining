<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effects of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> on perfusion deficits in the brain have been studied in an embolic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data showed that perfusion deficits were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats sacrificed immediately after middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> significantly reduced perfusion deficits 1 h but not 3 h after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings thus support that <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> is useful agent in treatment and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and show that its mechanism of action is likely through the reopening of cerebral microvessels </plain></SENT>
