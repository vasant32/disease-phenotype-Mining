<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty rats were randomly divided into equal-sized experimental and control groups, which were subdivided into groups studied at five different time points, ranging from 6 hours to 22 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the rats received transcalvarial irradiation with 560-nm light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five rats in each time group also received a sensitizing dye before irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these latter animals, lesions of uniform size and location developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions were compared with tissue of similar volume and location from the contralateral cortex of the experimental animals and with tissue from both hemispheres of the control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TDCs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the samples were measured and fit with mono- and bi-exponential functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unlike the control tissue, infarcted tissue displayed definitive two-component TDC behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time course of the bi-exponential parameters yielded information unavailable from mono-exponential analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bi-exponential analysis of TDCs may have diagnostic use as a more sensitive indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> than mono-exponential analyses </plain></SENT>
