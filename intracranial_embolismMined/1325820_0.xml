<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This enzyme could be measured 6 hours after the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, then showed two peaks, one after 8 hours and another after 18 to 24 hours in 2 phase fashion as could be measured as far as 7 days, which was the termination of this experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> into the ischemic area play an important role for the extension of the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further study should undertake whether leukocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> decrease the ischemic area or not </plain></SENT>
