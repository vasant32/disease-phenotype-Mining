<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient (case 1) demonstrated a compensated, protracted <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (Table 1), which disappeared after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">phenprocoumon</z:chebi> (Marcoumar) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other patient (case 2) demonstrated increasee spontaneous platelet aggregability (Table 2), which was treated sucessfully with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (Magnyl) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> (Persantine) </plain></SENT>
