<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complications associated with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> are distinctly rare and poorly characterized, especially unusual sequelae such as pseudoaneurysm of the abdominal mesentery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our case involves an adolescent who presented with several weeks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and eventual <z:mp ids='MP_0006114'>cardiac murmur</z:mp> and was found to have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi>-resistant Enterococcus growing as a vegetation on a previously undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had a cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presenting as Broca's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> before cardiac surgery, as well as a superior mesenteric artery pseudoaneurysm several days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
