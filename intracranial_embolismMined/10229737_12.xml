<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> can be identified by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) with the use of different contrast agents and by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systematic data are available on neither the reproducibility of contrast TCD, the comparison of different contrast agents, nor the comparison of simultaneous bilateral to unilateral recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we assessed the side distribution of thus provoked artificial cardiac emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four patients were investigated by TEE and by bilateral TCD of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following protocol was performed twice: injection of 9 mL of agitated saline without Valsalva maneuver, injection of 9 mL of agitated saline with Valsalva maneuver, injection of 5 mL of a commercial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-based contrast agent without Valsalva maneuver, and injection of 5 mL of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-based contrast agent with Valsalva maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 18 patients, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> was demonstrated by TEE and contrast TCD (shunt positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients were negative in both investigations, 1 was positive on TEE and negative on TCD, and 6 patients were only positive on TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both bilateral and repeated recordings increased the sensitivity of contrast TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a symmetrical distribution of microembolic signals in the right and left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD performed twice and with the use of saline or a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>-based contrast agent is a sensitive method in the identification of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> also identified by TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cardiac microemboli in this study did not show any side preference for one of the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
