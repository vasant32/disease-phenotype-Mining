<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this article is to discuss that technology modification may improve the outcomes of this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between October 1997 and October 2004, 439 consecutive patients with 478 stenotic carotid arteries were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>284 vessels were stented without the use of embolic protection devices and 194 vessels with protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among cases not using protection device, 201 arteries were stented with predilation alone, 63 with postdilation alone, six with both pre- and post-dilation, two with neither and twelve were stented with balloon expandable stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technical success of 100%.The combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate during the procedure and the 30-day follow-up at 30 days was 1.67% overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three (0.63%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred; one was due to a major infarction secondary to stent breakage, and two died of massive reperfusion intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were total six <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, of the five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> wich developed in nonprotection group, two were among 201 cases with predilation alone (0.99%), which developed after stent deployment and postprocedure, and three among 63 cases with postdilation alone (4.76%), which developed immediately after postdilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was lower among those who were stented with predilation alone than among those who were stented with postdilation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This likely results from reduced intimal injury and decreased risk of embolic complications </plain></SENT>
