<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the safety and efficacy of LMWH in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Randomized, controlled, and nonconfounded trials of LMWH in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were identified from the Cochrane Library (version 2, 1999), previous systematic reviews, and a review of publication quality relating to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors each independently extracted data by treatment group and assessed trial quality using Cochrane Collaboration criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven completed RCTs involving 3048 patients were identified; data were available from 10 of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four trials explicitly excluded patients with presumed cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with LMWH was associated with significant reductions in prospectively identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.96) and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.69) and with increased major extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (OR 2.17, 95% 1.10 to 4.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonsignificant increases in end-of-treatment (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.69) and end-of-trial (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.32) case fatality and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (OR 1.77, 95% CI 0 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>End-of-trial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disability was nonsignificantly reduced (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ++LMWHs reduce venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and increase the risk of extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A nonsignificant reduction in combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disability and nonsignificant increases in case fatality and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the current evidence, LMWH should not be used in the routine management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
