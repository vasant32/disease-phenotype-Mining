<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> during cardiopulmonary bypass is a frightening complication requiring immediate response and carrying strong medicolegal implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From July, 1971, to July, 1979, there were eight instances of massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> during 3,620 cardiopulmonary bypass operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five such accidents from other institutions are included in this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Causes were (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">inattention</z:e> to reservoir level, (2) reversal of pump head tubing or direction of pump head rotation, (3) unexpected resumption of heartbeat, (4) inadequate steps to remove air after cardiotomy, (5) high-flow suction deep in a pulmonary artery, (6) defective oxygenator, (7) use of a pressurized cardiotomy reservoir, and (8) inadvertent detachment of oxygenator during bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevention includes a systematic check of pump suckers and perfusion lines before bypass, a sensing device on the oxygenator reservoir, secure fixation of the oxygenator and avoidance of traffic around pump equipment, immediate cessation of pump and inspection for abnormal noise, use of standard maneuvers to remove air from the heart, and carotid compression with resumption of heartbeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediate management of massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> consists of placing the patient in a deep Trendelenburg position and making a large stab wound in the ascending aorta for retrograde drainage from the cerebrovascular bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Temporary retrograde perfusion through the superior vena cava (SVC) may also be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent steps are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with the resumption of cardiopulmonary bypass, elevation of blood pressure, steroids, ventilation with 100% oxygen, and deep <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 13 patients, there were four instantaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral injury which resolved within a 2 month period occurred in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remainder had no neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nonfatal cerebral air injury may be associated with prolonged convalescence yet complete recovery, as compared to embolism from debris or clot, which offers a poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
