<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Promising data with low recurrence rates have been reported for several self-expanding double disk devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The implantation of the device is usually performed by passing the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in one patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (m, 43 years) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed an atrial septum abnormality with a hypermobile septum and a very small distance (approximately 12 mm) between the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> channel and the anterior mitral valve leaflet, which was too short to accommodate the regular implantation procedure of the device via the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>-channel itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this particular case the device (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>-Star <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSD</z:e>) was advanced to the left atrium via an additional transseptal puncture--performed under TEE guidance--to allow for complete closure of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> without impairment of the mitral valve function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No periinterventional complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period of 9 months the patient was completely asymptomatic with no functional impairment of the mitral valve and no residual intracardiac shunt </plain></SENT>
