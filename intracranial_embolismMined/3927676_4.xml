<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was developed to evaluate the feasibility of selective fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 20 Flemish Giant rabbits, autologous clot was deposited via selected catheterization of the distal end of the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rates of clot lysis with streptokinase were compared in eight control rabbits and after three different dosage regimens in four rabbits each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group A received selective infusion of 5000 U/hr; group B received 4000 U/min for 1 hr, 3000 U/min for 2 hr, and 5000 U/hr for 2 hr; and group C was treated similar to group B plus receiving an initial 20,000 U bolus of streptokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lysis was evaluated by serial angiograms obtained hourly for up to 6 hr after the clot was deposited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five proximal vessels arising from the common carotid artery were chosen for the angiographic grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The control group showed beginning lysis after 5-6 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group A appeared to show a slight improvement about 4 hr after clotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group B demonstrated an early and greater improvement at 2 hr that appeared to be sustained throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group C showed no difference compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Dunnet t procedure and the Kruskel-Wallis nonparametric analysis of variance were used for comparing the angiograms of the treatment groups with those of the control group at corresponding study times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of these animal experiments do not indicate a definite benefit of streptokinase treatment alone over no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further controlled studies are needed before the value of streptokinase in routine clinical practice can be determined </plain></SENT>
