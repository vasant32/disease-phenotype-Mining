<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Perioperative ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality associated with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to test the hypotheses that the detection of microembolic ultrasonic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) during and after the operation may be of value in identifying patients at increased perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Open prospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-one consecutive patients undergoing CEA with TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative, intraoperative and interval postoperative TCD monitoring of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) ipsilateral to the operated carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On-line pre- and intraoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counting and blinded off-line analysis of postoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>End-points were any focal neurological deficit and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 30 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 94% of patients intraoperatively and 71% of cases during the first postoperative hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts ranged from 0 to 25 per operative phase (range of median counts 0-8) and from 0 to 212 per hour postoperatively (range of median counts 0-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight cases (10%) developed postoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts greater than 50/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five of these eight cases evolved ischaemic neurological deficits in the territory of the insonated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, indicating a strong association between frequent postoperative microembolism and the development of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> (chi 2 = 34.2, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were not associated with clinical outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts of greater than 50/h in the early postoperative phase of carotid endarterectomy are predictive of the development of ipsilateral focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
