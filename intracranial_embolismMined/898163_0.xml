<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the two bubble oxygenators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a marked, statistically significant difference between the bubble oxygenators and the disk oxygenator, the disk oxygenator yields considerably worse results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reason for this is obscure but probably lies in the different microembolic output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The literature, however is not consistent on this question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the present time, only bubble oxygenators are used in our unit </plain></SENT>
