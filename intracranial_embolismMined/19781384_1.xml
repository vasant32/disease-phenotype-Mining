<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The functional recruitment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> penumbra is extremely important to the recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to explore the expression of brain-type <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3) in cerebral ischemic penumbra at different blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels and different ischemic-reperfusion time in diabetic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results might provide an experimental basis for clinical treatment of diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Wistar rats included in this study were randomly assigned to 4 groups (50 rats each): <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (NC), uncontrolled diabetic group (DM1), poorly-controlled diabetic group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>), and well-controlled diabetic group (DM3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diabetic rats were induced by single intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>, and the focal ischemic rat model of middle <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was made by insertion of fishing thread in 6 weeks after the establishment of the diabetic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each group was divided into 5 subgroups (10 rats each): four focal ischemic subgroups at different ischemic-reperfusion time (at 3,12, 24 and 72 hours after reperfusion, respectively) and one sham-operated subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was significant difference in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 between the four focal ischemic subgroups and the sham-operated subgroup at different reperfusion time in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in the 4 ischemic groups began to increase at 3 hours, peaked at 24 hours after reperfusion and maintained at a higher level even at 72 hours compared with that of the sham-operated subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of GLUT1 increased more significantly than that of GLUT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 was significantly different between the diabetic groups and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 was increased more significantly in the diabetic groups than that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the groups with different blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression tended to decrease with <z:mp ids='MP_0001559'>increased blood glucose levels</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The expression trend of GLUT1 and GLUT3 protein was similar to that of GLUT1 and GLUT3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression was notably up-regulated in the penumbra region after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>But the up-regulated amplitude of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in the diabetic rats with cerebral ischemic injury became smaller than that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the treatment of diabetic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control should not be too strict, otherwise the up-regulation of GLUT1 and GLUT3 induced by cerebral ischemic injury might not be able to meet the needs of energy metabolism in cells </plain></SENT>
