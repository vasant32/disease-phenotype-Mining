<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed surgery within 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SAH, identified on neuroimaging as a cast distending the ventricular system, in 74 patients with poor-grade SAH (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Grades IV and V) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of these patients had packed IVH; in these patients the intraventricular clots were extensively evacuated via frontal corticotomy performed under microscopic view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 42% of the 74 patients undergoing craniotomy in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage had favorable outcomes, whereas 30% died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate analysis, variables significantly associated with favorable outcome in patients with poor-grade SAH included absence of a packed intraventricular clot on computerized tomography scanning; absence of a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>; and a Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score of 11 or 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the 18 patients who had packed IVH had favorable outcomes and seven of these died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six recently treated patients with packed IVH, which was examined using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, extensive periventricular brain damage was found both immediately after surgery and during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the authors believe that irreversible periventricular brain damage is already complete immediately after packed IVH occurs </plain></SENT>
