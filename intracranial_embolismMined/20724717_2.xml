<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the frequency of HITS associated with different surgical maneuvers during cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery bypass graft surgery and their association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1319200" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">postoperative cognitive dysfunction</z:e> (POCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We combined 356 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft from 2 clinical trials who had both neuropsychological testing (before, 1 week and 3 months after surgery) and transcranial Doppler during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HITS were grouped into periods that included: cannulation, cardiopulmonary bypass <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, aortic crossclamp-on, aortic crossclamp-off, side clamp-on, side clamp-off, and decannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>POCD was defined by a decreased combined Z-score of at least 2.0 or reduction in Z-scores of at least 2.0 in 20% of the individual tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence of POCD was 47.3% and 6.3% at 1 week and 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no association between cardiopulmonary bypass counts of HITS and POCD at 1 week (P=0.617) and 3 months (P=0.110) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in HITS counts were identified at any of the surgical periods between patients with and without POCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors affecting HITS counts were surgical period (P&lt;0.0001), blood flow velocity (P=0.012), cardiopulmonary bypass duration (P=0.040), and clinical study (P=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although cerebral microemboli have been implicated in the pathogenesis of POCD, in this study that included low-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, there was no demonstrable correlation between the counts of HITS and POCD </plain></SENT>
