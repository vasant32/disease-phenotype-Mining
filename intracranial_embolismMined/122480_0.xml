<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disturbances were primarily in the form of cerebral haemorrhages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The symptoms ranged from ephemeral neurological deficiencies to massive hemi-syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete remission occurred in 16 patients, partial remission in 24 patients, two patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were subdivided into two age groups, one comprising 31 persons between 17 and 39, and the other 11 persons between 41 and 52 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim was to ascertain facts which were related to the possibility of haemorrhage in women taking ovulation inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first finding, statistically significant, was that the possibility of a cerebro-vascular disturbance increases with the period during which the pill is taken and that this possibility is especially great in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> which may also be existent in the family, and in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second finding, not significant however, was that the risk was higher in the presence of several factors in one person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These factors include familial factors with a predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, past illnesses of the peripheral vascular system, a predisposition to allergic reactions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and kidney damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Should one of these situations or both prevail, the patient will be advised to stop taking the pill, and the contraceptive will be discontinued if certain prodromes are observed in a general form, or if focal symptoms occur </plain></SENT>
