<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Endovascular treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: 259 angioplasties of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stenosis was an inflammatory stenosis or a restenosis post endarterectomy in 71 cases, atherosclerotic stenosis in 188 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was performed without cerebral protection in 123 cases including a group of 38 with atherosclerotic bifurcation stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cerebral protection (triple coaxial catheter) was used in 136 atherosclerotic bifurcation stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There has been no complication related to the procedure in the 71 cases of nonatherosclerotic stenosis and the 14 cases of proximal carotid and siphon atherosclerotic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There has been 5% of dissection and 8% embolic complication in the group of 38 atherosclerotic bifurcation cases treated without cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There has been no embolic complication in the 136 atherosclerotic bifurcation cases treated with cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There has been 5% dissection in this group before stents and 0% after stents have been used in less then satisfactory results (61 stents placed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Restenosis has also decreased after stents (15% to 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular approach can now be considered for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A cerebral protection with temporary carotid occlusion is mandatory in atherosclerotic carotid bifurcation cases to rule out embolic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complementary stents, when necessary, have reduced the immediate risk of dissection and of restenosis later on </plain></SENT>
