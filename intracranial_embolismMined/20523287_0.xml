<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: According to the results of the large trials on carotid endarterectomy (CEA), this type of surgery is only warranted if perioperative mortality and morbidity are kept considerably low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less attention has been paid to methods of cerebral protection during CEA, although intraoperative transcranial Doppler (TCD) can visualise intracerebral microemboli (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) during routine carotid dissection, although <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> occur throughout the CEA, only those during dissection are related to neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevention of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> by means of early control of the distal internal carotid artery dislodging from the carotid artery plaque during dissection is very likely the mechanism behind an eventual benefit from this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, the amount of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> might serve as a surrogate parameter for the risk of periprocedural neurological events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>So, the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether early control of the distal carotid artery during CEA is capable of reducing the number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> by means of a prospective randomised trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (29 procedures) could be prospectively included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before surgery we randomly assigned the patients to two groups: group A (N.=12): CEA by means of early control of the distal internal carotid artery; group B (N.=17): CEA with dissection of the total carotid bifurcation before clamping the arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Periprocedurally, we continuously monitored the cerebral blood flow in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery by means of TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative morbidity were independently verified by a neurologist &lt;2 days before and not later than five days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Values of microembolic signs during dissection were summarised with arithmetic means and standard deviations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For further analysis non parametric Wilcoxon test was performed between both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>P-values &lt;0.05 were considered as statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Wilcoxon test was performed to compare both methods concerning clamp- and procedure times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We performed EEA 26 times, in three patients a longitudinal arteriotomy with endarterectomy and patchplasty was performed, in one of these patients a shunt was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 12 twelve patients <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> occurred during the dissection before clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eight of these patients belonged to group B and four patients to group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The mean number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during dissection for group A was 2.4 (SD 4.6; 5-15) and for group B 3.9 (SD 7.1; 2-28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There is no statistically significant difference in the Wilcoxon-test; P=0.4375 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There was no patient showing reperfusion syndrom or clinical signs of a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> or any other neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There were no other major complications like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as well as no minor complications like periphereal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0847483" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nerve lesions</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or wound healing disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this prospective, randomised trial early control of the distal internal carotid artery did not reduce the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during dissection of the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Also, the total number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> throughout the procedure and postoperatively was comparable between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The procedure related times as well as the clinical outcome did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Thus, early control of the distal internal carotid artery has got no advantage but also no disadvantage as compared to the traditional CEA technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, a limitation of the study is the small number of patients included </plain></SENT>
