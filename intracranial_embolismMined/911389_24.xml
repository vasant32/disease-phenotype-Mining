<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two minutes after restoration of flow, an amorphous coating covered the vessel lumen around the suture line, and oozing of blood from the suture line ceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 15 minutes, a partially occluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was present, which was maximal at the anastomotic bifurcation point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> underwent partial lysis or embolization within 30 minutes, and gross intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> did not recur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> that formed within 2 minutes were composed of platelets and erythrocytes in a loose reticular fibrin network, but the intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> present at the branch point 15 minutes after flow restoration appeared to be composed solely of platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombi</z:e> that did not undergo complete dissolution had a loss of distinct cellular elements at later time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fibrin-platelet matrix coating the lumen remained unchanged during the initial 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When examined at 9 days, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endothelium was present throughout the vessel with the exception of the suture line, which remained covered by a smooth coagulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This sequence of events suggest that if surgical manipulation is to result in complete occlusion of the anastomosis, it will likely occur in the initial 30 minutes after resumption of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> regimens were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with aspirin and intraoperative <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> irrigation of the vessel lumen were not beneficial in altering the quantity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> regimes tested resulted in a quantitative decrease of thrombotic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five minutes of intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy after resumption of blood flow was as effective as long-term <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in decreasing the transient intraluminal thrombotic response </plain></SENT>
