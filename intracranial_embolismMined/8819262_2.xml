<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SNP infused at doses from 10 micrograms/kg/h significantly inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in a dose dependent manner </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SIN-1 at a dose of 100 micrograms/kg/h also demonstrated a significant antithrombotic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, treatment with SNP increased vessel diameter in a dose dependent manner and enhanced the mean red cell velocity measured with a fiber-optic laser-Doppler anemometer microscope (FLDAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood flow, calculated from the mean red cell velocity and vessel diameters was increased significantly during infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mean wall shear rates in the arterioles and venules were not changed by SNP infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that SNP and SIN-1 possessed potent antithrombotic activities, whilst SNP increased cerebral blood flow without changing wall shear rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that the NO released by SNP and SIN-1 may be beneficial for the treatment and protection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
