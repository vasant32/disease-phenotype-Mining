<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether aortic atherosclerotic plaques are associated with increased frequency of microembolic signals and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 69 such patients were monitored by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography for 30 minutes before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this study is the 1st in which in vivo pathologic analysis of aortic plaques was systematically performed-and microembolic signals monitored-before and after open-heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plaques were assessed by transesophageal echocardiography and by biopsy of materials taken during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of microembolic signals was evaluated with regard to the occurrence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the preoperative phase, only 10 of 48 patients with aortic plaques had microembolic signals, and the mean count of microembolic signals was 3.2 +/- 1.2 per hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the conclusion of 24 postoperative hours, 29 patients (42%) displayed such signals (mean count, 9.8 +/- 3.1/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 48 patients (15%) with aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> had cerebral ischemic events, but none of those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aorta (21 patients) experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the postoperative phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During postoperative monitoring, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had higher microembolic-signal counts than did those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aorta (174 +/- 3.3/h vs 5.9 +/- 3.1/h; P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that microembolic signals can be a marker of severe aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and that monitoring these signals should enable the application of appropriate surgical methods to coronary artery bypass patients who are at higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
