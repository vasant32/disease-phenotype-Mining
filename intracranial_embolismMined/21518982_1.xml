<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome is clinically characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000967'>petechiae</z:hpo>, and neurological dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is associated mainly with long bone fracture and bone marrow fat passage to the systemic circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An intracardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) could allow larger fat particles to reach the systemic circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler can be a useful tool to detect both RLS and the fat particles reaching the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively studied patients with femur shaft fracture with RLS evaluation, daily transcranial Doppler with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection studies, and neurological examinations to evaluate the relation of RLS and microembolic signals to the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients were included; 14 had an RLS detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients developed neurological symptoms; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them had a positive RLS (P=&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with an RLS showed higher counts and higher intensities of microembolic signals (P=&lt;0.05 and P=&lt;0.01, respectively) compared with those who did not have an RLS identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of high microembolic signal counts and intensities in patients with RLS was strongly predictive of the occurrence of neurological symptoms (odds ratio, 204; 95% confidence interval, 11 to 3724; P&lt;0.001) with a positive predictive value of 86% and negative predictive value of 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with long bone fractures, the presence of an RLS is associated with larger and more frequent microembolic signals to the brain detected by transcranial Doppler study and can predict the development of neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
