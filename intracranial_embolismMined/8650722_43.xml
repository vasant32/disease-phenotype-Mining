<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may affect pathways connecting to distant brain regions and therefore may also alter the function of remote parts of the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Remote changes in electric activity, blood flow, and metabolism are called diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we addressed the question of whether in brain areas contralateral to a photochemically induced cortical infarction alteration of excitability can be observed as an indication of the effects of diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We induced focal lesions in the sensory area at the border of the motor and occipital cortices by injecting the photosensitizing dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and illuminating the skull stereotaxically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven days after induction of photothrombosis, electrophysiological recordings were obtained with standard methods from 400-microns-thick neocortical coronal slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As an indication of inhibition we used a paired-pulse stimulus protocol and calculated a ratio of the amplitudes of the second versus the first excitatory postsynaptic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In lesioned animals we found a significant increase of the ratio over a wide zone of the neocortex, both ipsilateral and contralateral, compared with unlesioned animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a neocortical infarction leads to hyperexcitability not only in its direct vicinity but also in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such hyperexcitability may contribute to increased activation of contralateral brain areas and to functional reorganization after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
