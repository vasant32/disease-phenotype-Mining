<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several multicenter, randomized clinical trials for prevention of thromboemblolism performed in the Western countries have revealed efficacy of the anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> over the anti-platelet aggregation therapy with aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic guideline for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has been established based on these observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, special attentions should be paid for applying the guideline for Japanese patients since <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk in antithrombotic treatment seems to be high in Japanese </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However treatment target of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, ie, PT-INR, is designated rather low in Japanese patients, especially in eldely patients over 75 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Usage of antiplatelet treatment with aspirin is also described in this guideline for Japanese, however, the evidence suggesting the usefulness for prophylaxis with aspirin is not sufficiently obtained in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
