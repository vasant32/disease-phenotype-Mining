<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> complicates cardiac surgical procedures in a substantial number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is predominantly embolic, although hypoperfusion may play a role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether radiologic appearances in this population were consistent with an embolic cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed computed tomographic scans and medical records in 24 patients who suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after cardiac operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was evident at 24 hours in 19 patients (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were multiple in 16 and single in 3 patients (group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 5 patients suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> beyond 24 hours and had single <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on computed tomographic scan (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group 1, 15 patients (79%) had bilateral cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, 4 (74%) had posterior cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, 10 (53%) had posterior watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and 11 patients (58%) had middle cerebral artery branch <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean number of vascular territories involved was 5.1 (range, 1 to 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mobile atheromatous plaque was present in the ascending aorta or arch in 5 of 9 patients (56%) in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in close association with atrial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> in 3 of 5 patients (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with radiologic evidence of infarction, perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> after cardiac operation are typically multiple, and involve the posterior parts of the brain, consistent with atheroembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> may be attributable to cardiogenic embolism </plain></SENT>
