<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiac evaluation is routinely conducted in patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> because embolisms originating from the heart are an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the prevalence of cardioaortic sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (CSCE) in patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> detected by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and/or multidetector cardiac computed tomography (MDCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionaly, we investigated the frequency and severity of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in patients who underwent MDCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who had no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent cardiac evaluation using TTE alone (N=243, during the early phase of this study--TTE period), TTE and MDCT (N=62, midphase--transitional period) and MDCT alone (N=138, late phase--MDCT period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSCE were defined according to the original and revised TOAST classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CAD was defined as 50% or more stenosis of the coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients' characteristics did not differ amongst groups; however, CSCE were more frequently detected in the MDCT period than in the TTE period (18.1% vs. 6.6%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the transitional period, there were 16 patients (25.8%) who were found to be CSCE by MDCT but not TTE, whilst three patients (4.8%) were found to be CSCE by TTE but not MDCT (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Amongst the patients who underwent MDCT, 72 (36.0%) had asymptomatic CAD, invasive coronary angiography was needed in 21 (10.5%) and 10 (5.0%) patients finally underwent coronary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multidetector cardiac computed tomography proved to be complementary to TTE for the identification of CSCE and can detect asymptomatic CAD, one of the major causes of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in patients with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
