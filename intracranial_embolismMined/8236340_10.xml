<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of patients with potential embolic sources may allow identification of high-risk patients who can then be selected for prophylactic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, practical patient monitoring will require automated programs that can detect emboli and differentiate them from artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A new off-line algorithm for the detection of emboli, which detects the characteristic relative power increase occurring with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, was evaluated in both an animal model and in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(1) In a sheep model, solid embolic materials (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, platelet aggregates, and atheroma) were introduced into the proximal carotid artery while the distal carotid artery or a major branch was insonated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signals resulting from 77 emboli (mean size, 1.77 mm) were studied and compared with the Doppler signals resulting from artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) In patients, 100 embolic signals occurring in three patients were analyzed and compared with signals associated with artifact in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) In the sheep model, emboli resulted in a short-duration, high-intensity signal, but intensity increase alone did not distinguish between emboli and artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the algorithm discriminated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> from artifact with a sensitivity of 98.7% and a specificity of 98.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(2) In patient studies, embolic signals were differentiated from artifact with a sensitivity of 97.2% and a specificity of 97.0% by the algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using such an algorithm, detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and discrimination from artifact are possible with a high sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of such an algorithm into an on-line system should make prolonged patient monitoring practical </plain></SENT>
