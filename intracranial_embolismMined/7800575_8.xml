<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three patients with inadvertently positioned left heart pacemaker leads were admitted for neurological symptoms consistent with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one of them, the pacemaker lead crossed the interatrial septum, the mitral valve, and entered the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In another it was erroneously placed through the subclavian artery, across the aortic valve, and into the left ventricular chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the third patient, the right ventricular lead of a <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> pacemaker was placed in the coronary sinus and the right atrial lead crossed the interatrial septum, and intermittently entered the left ventricular cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Once anticoagulation was initiated, symptoms resolved; they recurred when the level of anticoagulation dropped leading to a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in one of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients were on aspirin at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We believe that every approach must be considered to remove the malpositioned lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, full dose anticoagulation must be initiated since antiplatelet therapy alone does not confer adequate protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
