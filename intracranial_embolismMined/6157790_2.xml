<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Moderate unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by microembolism in 24 adult cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two million plastic microspheres with a diameter of 15 +/- 5 microns were injected into the left common carotid artery via the lingual artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The physiological and metabolic responses to embolism were accessed by electrocorticography and by determining the cerebral energy state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolism caused an immediate slowing and voltage reduction of the ipsilateral electrocorticogram with a gradual recovery after 30 to 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some animals also had an immediate and short <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the contralateral electrocorticogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In spite of the market functional suppression, metabolites of the cerebral energy-producing metabolism in most of the animals changed only slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the embolized hemisphere <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> increased from 0.06 to 0.10 mumol/g and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> from 1.9 to 4.6 mumol/g within 5 min after embolization and remained at this level during the 4 h observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phosphocreatine, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> and the energy charge of the adenylate pool remained uncharged during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was a slight increase of ATP in the non-embolized hemisphere during the early postembolic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two animals, the initial slowing of the electrocorticogram recurred and spread to the contralateral hemisphere, followed by bilateral flattening after a few hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This delayed functional deterioration was accomplished by complete loss of energy-rich phosphates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These animals also had a progressive increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure and considerable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> with cerebellar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> after 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in the above concentration leads only to a slight increase of anerobic glycolysis without significant perturbation of the cerebral energy state, unless progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> with cerebrellat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> supervenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This supports previous findings, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and not initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is the main pathogenetic factor for tissue damage in cerebral microembolism </plain></SENT>
