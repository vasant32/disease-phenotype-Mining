<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The emboli may come from cardiac valves or calcified atheroma of the aortic or carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Two patients with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> secondary to spontaneous calcium embolism confirmed by neuro imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases on CT scans there were dense points corresponding to calcified material within the middle cerebral artery or one of its branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first case migration of the calcified point following the course of the artery was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cranial CAT scans are essential for diagnosis of calcium embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Migration of the calcified point confirms the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is still not clear whether valve replacement is necessary in these patients and treatment with antiaggregants and/or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> is controversial </plain></SENT>
