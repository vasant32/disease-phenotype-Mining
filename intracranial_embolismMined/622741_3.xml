<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results show that a group of patients can be selected that will have low postoperative mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The success rate for restoration of blood flow is high, particularly if the operation is performed soon after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The long-term prognosis in patients in whom patency of the internal carotid artery is restored and maintained appears to be better than in those with persistent occlusion of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
