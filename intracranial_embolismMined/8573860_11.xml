<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors' data suggest that the heart may not recover sufficiently if the patient needs left ventricular assist beyond 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the authors treated six patients who were supported by VAS more than 3 weeks and were weaned from VAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of six patients were weaned from VAS and continue well, despite marginal cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other two patients, the natural heart did not sustain stable recovery, but their general conditions made them fit to be candidates for heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, long-term support should be considered to promote recovery of heart function with the use of VAS for profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
