<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors present a case with cTCD underestimating RLS because of jugular valve incompetence in a 42-year-old man presenting with an episode of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three weeks after transcatheter closure of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> associated with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, he experienced 2 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following a negative 45-minute <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> detection study with power M-mode TCD, the patient underwent a cTCD study with monitoring of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), the anterior cerebral artery, and the submandibular extracranial internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single microbubble (MB) was detected in the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in only 1 of 5 studies; the remaining runs <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> failed to detect an RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant MB reflux was noted in the left internal jugular vein because of jugular valve incompetence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that incompetence of the jugular vein valve can result in a false negative cTCD study for RLS detection </plain></SENT>
