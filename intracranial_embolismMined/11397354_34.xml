<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conflicting studies have suggested that mutations in specific coagulation genes may also provide a genetic basis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed clinical studies that examined the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms in coagulation and platelet factors, and a biochemical factor to determine if specific genotypes are correlated with patients with a history of arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was performed on studies for factors II (G20210A variant), V Leiden (G1691A), VII (R353Q), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (GP) IIIa receptor (PI(A1/A2)), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR, C677T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation for factor II or factor V polymorphisms to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in 5,607 and 5,431 patients studied, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also no correlation for factor II variants and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 3,451 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For factor V, statistical significance was achieved for the G1691A variant on 3,399 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.03 to 1.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GP IIIa PI(A1/A2) genotype was associated with increased risk for CAD in 7,920 patients (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24), but not for 1,855 patients who had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combined RQ and RR genotypes of factor VII R353Q were correlated to a reduced risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in 2,574 patients (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.93), whereas the QQ genotype had offered more protection (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The TT homozygous variant of MTHFR was associated with CAD risk in 5,644 patients studied (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.52) but not for 3,075 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study shows that for some genes, further studies are unnecessary, whereas for others, no more enrollments are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The impact of certain genotypes must be examined in relation to other established risk factors and potentially new therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
