<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: to investigate whether peripheral blood levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) or their inhibitors are altered in patients with particulate cerebral embolisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: using sandwich enzyme immunoassay, plasma levels of MMPs-1, -2, -3 and -9, plus TIMPs-1 and -2 were quantified in 70 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored with transcranial Doppler (TCD) preoperatively and during the dissection phase of the operation to detect those with spontaneous particulate embolisation (n =21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the plasma level of MMP-9 was significantly higher in those patients with evidence of spontaneous embolisation compared to those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in other MMP levels, or plasma concentrations of TIMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: plasma MMP-9 levels are elevated in patients with particulate cerebral embolisation, and this may represent a novel marker of atherosclerotic plaque instability </plain></SENT>
