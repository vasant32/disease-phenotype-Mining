<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also attempted to determine the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in BD patients with or without neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study enrolled 55 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of International Study Group for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasound of the middle cerebral arteries was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were identified based on the criteria of International Consensus group on Microembolus Detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD were divided into two groups in respect of the presence of neurological involvement (n = 10) or not (n = 45), and counts of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in the two were compared with each other and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in 16 patients (29%) with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency was higher in patients with neurological involvement than in those without (80% vs. 17%, P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with neurological involvement there was a positive correlation in regression analysis between the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and disease duration (P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly higher prevalence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in BD patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was higher in patients with neurological involvement than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TCD detection of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> may allow the recognition of subset of patients at high risk for the appearance of neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
