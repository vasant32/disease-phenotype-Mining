<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: The study aim was to determine the risk of thromboembolic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses who underwent non-cardiac surgery under different regimens of perioperative anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed on the basis of surgery type and underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 235 patients (mean age 63 +/- 4.5 years) with one or two mechanical heart valves underwent subsequent non-cardiac surgery comprising abdominal, vascular and thoracic, orthopedic, urologic, neurosurgery, ENT, plastic and reconstructive, and gynecologic operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean interval between heart valve replacement and non-cardiac surgery was 3.9 +/- 3.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perioperative oral anticoagulation was managed by discontinuation of oral anticoagulation and intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> administration; or by discontinuation and early postoperative re-institution of oral anticoagulation without intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>; or by no withdrawal of oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with bioprostheses were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall hospital mortality during non-cardiac surgery was 2.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic events</z:hpo> included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with transient deficit (n = 3), residual defect (n = 1) and irreversible defect (n = 1), as well as peripheral embolism (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic complications included wound <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (n = 10) and increased postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (n = 8) with re-exploration in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic complications occurred most often in patients with prosthetic mitral valve and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>; the lowest risk was in patients with sinus rhythm after aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most complications occurred after discharge and in patients with surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, within 10 days of instituting oral anticoagulation, and despite a therapeutic INR value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minor surgical procedures can be performed safely without discontinuing anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When major non-cardiac surgery is planned, discontinuing oral anticoagulation and starting perioperative intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> minimizes <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and thromboembolic risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic complications may occur within one month of surgery, despite adequate oral anticoagulation, though permanent morbidity is low </plain></SENT>
