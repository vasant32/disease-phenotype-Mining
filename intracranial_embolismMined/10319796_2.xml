<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Microscopic cerebral arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> (CAAE) occurs commonly during cardiac surgery and causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nonfocal neurologic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, most neuroimaging studies do not detect brain injury after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a rabbit model, the authors hypothesized they could detect and quantitate severe brain injury and infarction 24 h after microscopic CAAE using the vital stain triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experiments were conducted in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102216">methohexital</z:chebi> anesthetized New Zealand white rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical shams (n = 5) underwent surgery but had no neurologic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive controls (n = 3) received 200 microl/kg of intracarotid air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other animals were randomized to receive either 50 microl/kg intracarotid air, which produces microscopic CAAE (n = 18), or 300 microl intracarotid saline (control, n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included somatosensory evoked potential amplitude at 90 min, neurologic impairment score at 4 and 24 h (0 [<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>] to 99 [<z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>]), and percentage of nonstaining brain at 24 h using color-discrimination image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severely injured or infarcted brain does not stain with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surgical shams had little neurologic impairment and a small amount of nonstaining brain at 24 h (5.2 +/- 2.4%; mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive controls had profound neurologic impairment and large amounts of nonstaining brain (40-97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ninety-minute somatosensory evoked potential amplitude was less in animals receiving 50 microl/kg air versus saline: 38 +/- 28% versus 102 +/- 32%, respectively, P &lt; 1 x 10(-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neurologic impairment scores were greater in animals receiving 50 microl/kg air versus saline: at 4 h, 43 +/- 16 versus 23 +/- 9, P &lt; 1 x 10(-7); at 24 h, 24 +/- 12 versus 15 +/- 8, P = 0.013 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there was no difference between 50 microl/kg air and saline in nonstaining brain: 5.5 +/- 2.9% versus 6.8 +/- 5.4%, P = 0.83 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic injury after CAAE is dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although microscopic CAAE causes somatosensory evoked potential abnormalities and neurologic dysfunction, severe cerebral injury or infarction is not present at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The author's findings are consistent with clinical imaging studies that suggest microscopic CAAE causes neurologic dysfunction even though overt infarction is absent </plain></SENT>
