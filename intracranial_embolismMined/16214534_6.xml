<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Microembolic signals detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography have been demonstrated to be clinically relevant in patients supported with pulsatile left ventricular assist devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively investigated the quantity of microembolic signals in patients supported with the continuous-flow DeBakey left ventricular assist device (MicroMed DeBakey VAD; MicroMed Technology, Inc, Houston, Tex) including the refined Carmeda BioActive Surface system (Carmeda AB, Stockholm, Sweden) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients (20 male) aged 14 to 62 years supported with DeBakey left ventricular assist devices (n = 6 with Carmeda) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signal monitorings were performed twice weekly by insonating the middle cerebral artery for 20 minutes without and 20 minutes with oronasal application of oxygen (6 L/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evidence of clinically manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> was based on regular questionnaires, clinical examinations, and results of diagnostic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite a low incidence of thromboembolic complications (0.24 per 100 left ventricular assist device days), 20 patients (87%) showed circulating microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, microembolic signals were found in 175 of 499 transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic examinations (35.1%), with mean counts of 81.2 +/- 443 (range 0-5042 signals/h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both microembolic signal prevalence (25% vs 34%, P = .01) and absolute signal counts (46.5 vs 104, P &lt; .01) significantly declined with oxygen delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between the individual microembolic signal activity and the incidence of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> or the intensity of antihemostatic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients supported with the Carmeda device did not show reduced rates of clinical thromboembolization or cerebral microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with DeBakey left ventricular assist devices, a high load of clinically silent microemboli can be detected within the cerebral arteries despite a low incidence of embolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It needs to be investigated whether such continuous, presumably gaseous microembolization causes cognitive or neuropsychologic deficits </plain></SENT>
