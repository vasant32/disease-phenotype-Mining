<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Certain types of abnormality have been linked to certain specific diagnoses: for example, a crescent-shaped lesion would suggest <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> to many people, a wedge-shaped lesion would suggest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accident</z:e>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some features thought to be characteristic of certain diseases are actually quite nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, the "doughnut" sign--at first believed to be characteristic of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>--has also been found in primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The "crescent" sign that was at first thought to be specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> occurs also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, scalp or skull trauma, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> en plaque, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some features of abnormalities are highly specific for certain diseases; e.g., wedge- or flame-shaped lesions are rarely seen with disorders other than <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, and lesions in the midline or in the posterior fossa are almost invariably <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the features of abnormalities on brain scans that in the literature have been reportedly associated with specific types of disease and explores the strength and validity of the associations </plain></SENT>
