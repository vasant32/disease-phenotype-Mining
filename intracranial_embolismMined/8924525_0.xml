<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular disease is the third cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in much of the occidental countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nowadays <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is well recognized as an independent and important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to know the frequency of AF in the patients who were admitted to a hospital for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the clinical risk factors associated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> and the prevention of cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 164 patients older than 65 years were admitted to the hospital during 5 months, those who were suspected of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only the patients who had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> demonstrated by computed tomography of brain with a neurological alteration of at least 3 days were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty eight patients (27 men) met the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>22 of them had AF (9 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of them had no other clinical risk factors associated and 19 had: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 10 cases, 8 had previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 1 had a episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> 3 months before being admitted in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the moment of admission only 4 patients were treated with aspirin and none with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: a) 38% of elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>b) The association with other clinical factors that increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> is high (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>c) The percentage of patients having a preventing treatment for cardiogenic embolism is very low </plain></SENT>
