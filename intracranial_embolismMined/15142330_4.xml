<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After induction of general anesthesia, ultrasound was used to guide direct puncture of the common carotid artery followed by the introduction of a 5 French sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A GuardWire distal protection balloon (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA) was placed distal to the lesion and deployed at nominal diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A balloon-expandable stent was deployed without difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following stent placement, angiography demonstrated improved flow in the entire right carotid artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no complications related to cervical soft tissue damage or clinical embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged in 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Direct carotid access is acceptable in select patients in whom a transfemoral, brachial, or transradial approach is technically difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of distal cerebral protection devices may reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> associated with these procedures </plain></SENT>
