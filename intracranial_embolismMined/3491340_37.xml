<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine millilitres of preclotted autologous blood was injected into the ventricles of 10 adult mongrel dogs (control dogs) to create subtotal ventricular casts with solid clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neurological status and systemic fibrinolytic profiles were closely monitored, and the changes in clot and ventricular volumes were measured by serial computed tomography (CT) for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control animals showed severe neurological impairment for 7 to 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No visible lysis of the intraventricular clots occurred for 5 to 7 days, after which slow clot lysis occurred at a constant rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete lysis of the 10 clots took 38 to 65 days, indicating that canine cerebrospinal fluid normally possessed limited capacity for in situ fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 control dogs, 8 developed progressive ventricular enlargement after a transient initial shrinkage parallel with initial clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their final ventricular volume at 3 months was as much as 14 times the base line ventricular volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Necropsy studies disclosed increased basal subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and extensive ependymal and subependymal damage in the lateral ventricular walls of the hydrocephalic dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten other dogs (UK dogs) were given similar ventricular clot injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six hours later, each UK dog was begun on a regimen of 20,000 IU of intraventricular urokinase every 12 hours until solid clots were no longer seen in the ventricles on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 UK dogs, intraventricular urokinase induced complete lysis in 3 to 6 days without causing local or systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The neurological status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 dogs also improved promptly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 8 UK dogs, the ventricles that were initially distended by clots showed rapid shrinkage parallel with thrombolysis to a final volume at 3 months of less than four times the initial ventricular volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only 2 animals had persistently large or expanding ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At necropsy, the ependymal and subarachnoid spaces of the UK dogs were remarkably free of damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanisms by which intraventricular urokinase may prevent posthemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
