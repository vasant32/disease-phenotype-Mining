<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler sonography has recently been introduced to monitor microemboli entering the middle cerebral artery in cardiac and carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore used this technique to evaluate the risk of asymptomatic embolism during common cardiac procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were monitored by transcranial Doppler while undergoing direct current cardioversion (n=15) and cardiac catheterization (n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microemboli were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients having cardiac catheterization but in only 1 patient after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microembolism occurred frequently during cardiac catheterization and rarely during cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is not yet known whether this has clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
