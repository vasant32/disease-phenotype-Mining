<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to develop the first animal model of vulnerable carotid atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carotid atherosclerotic models were created in 12 Yucatan minipigs by using a combination of partial ligation and high cholesterol diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retia mirabilia from these animals were examined histopathologically to identify distal embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of distal embolism with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and a thin fibrous cap was analyzed by using the Fisher exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Typical features of vulnerable plaques, including a thin fibrous cap, necrotic core, and intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, were observed in this swine model of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distal embolism was detected in retia mirabilia supplied by 7 of 10 carotid arteries with advanced atherosclerotic plaques, compared with 3 of 14 carotid arteries without advanced plaque (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This swine model of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> contains the salient features of vulnerable plaques, including plaque rupture and distal embolism </plain></SENT>
