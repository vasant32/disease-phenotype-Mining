<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The increase in Lp(a) is strongly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005181'>premature coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Apo(a) has striking homology to plasminogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found in an in vitro purified system that Lp(a) competes with both plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) for fibrin binding sites, thus resulting in a decrease in fibrin-dependent plasminogen activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, plasma fibrinolysis was studied in a young patient who had a consistently high level of Lp(a) (198 mg/dl) and had suffered from cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> 12 months previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of plasma plasminogen and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The euglobulin lysis time before and after venous occlusion was not prolonged, and after the addition of tPA to the patient's plasma or whole blood, the clot lysis time was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same result was obtained when the patient's plasma was depleted of Lp(a) before clotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the patient's plasma serpins were inhibited, plasminogen activation by tPA in the presence of several fibrin concentrations was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, suggesting that the formation of the ternary complex tPA - plasminogen - fibrin was not inhibited by the presence of high levels of Lp(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that a consistently high level of Lp(a) in this patient did not inhibit tPA-dependent fibrinolysis, and the thrombotic episode was not therefore related to deficient thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
