<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Jyros bileaflet rotating valves were implanted as a clinical trial conducted in Japan, and the 5-year results were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients underwent implantation of the valves: 14 in the mitral and 5 in the aortic position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 65.4+/-15.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was 1 case of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and another case of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (1.0% per patient year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> survivors were in New York Heart Association class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the early postoperative cinefluorography, 8 valves (42.1%) showed rotation of the leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in the latest assessment 6 valves (33.3%) showed rotation, some valves had stopped rotation, and others had started to rotate during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Jyros valve functions effectively, similar to other bileaflet valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, because the correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and the rotation mechanism is not clear, further follow-up of our patients and more implant studies are necessary to elucidate this issue </plain></SENT>
