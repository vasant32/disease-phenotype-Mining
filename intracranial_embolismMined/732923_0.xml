<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pseudo-vascular form has been found in 58 cases (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If we only consider the supratentorial localizations, this percentage rises to 43,5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptomatology is quite predominant in males (52 cases 42%) compared to females (6 cases: 16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MTBs that in our statistics produce a greater frequence of pseudo-vascular forms are the MTBs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanomas</z:hpo> (66%), those of unknown origin (42%) and those of pulmonary origin (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are distinctly more frequent in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary the mammary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> responsible for most of the female MTBs originate to a pseudo-vascular form in only 22% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The etio-pathogenetic mechanism is double; it may be the manifestation either of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> by neoplastic cells (embolia neoplastica attiva) or of disruption of the vascular wall and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As far as the diagnosis is concerned this syndrome can be quite easily recognised only when an extraneuraxial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is found, especially with a marked neuraxial tropism </plain></SENT>
