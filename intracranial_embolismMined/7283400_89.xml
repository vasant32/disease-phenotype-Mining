<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 4 instances of unilateral paramedian thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were characterized by mood and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo>, limitation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to the center of the anatomical paramedian territory, and symmetrical configuration of the paramedian thalamic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was found in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5 cases of bilateral paramedian thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004372'>disturbances of consciousness</z:hpo> and behavior, extension of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (to the mammillothalamic tracts in 4 cases, the red nuclei in 3, and the hypothalamus in 2), and a variable paramedian thalamic arterial pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The arterial pattern was symmetrical in 2 cases, asymmetrical in 1, and unilateral in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery was occluded in 1 case, the basilar communicating and posterior cerebral arteries in 1, and a third patient had occlusion involving an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 19 patients with paramedian thalamopeduncular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0004372'>disturbances of consciousness</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100786'>hypersomnia</z:hpo>, deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, akinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002300'>mutism</z:hpo>) associated with ocular motility changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Later, <z:mp ids='MP_0001388'>abnormal movements</z:mp>--always delayed--and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbances</z:e> were observed in some </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thalamic changes were restricted to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">beh</z:chebi> paramedian territory in only 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The arterial pattern was symmetrical in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The basilar and posterior cerebral arteries were occluded in 4 patients each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Paramedian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were rarely found as isolated lesions and were always bilateral when there was only one arterial pedicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The paramedian thalamic pedicle can supply the polar thalamic territory </plain></SENT>
