<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that increases in levels of Ang1 reduce blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) leakage in ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombinant adenoviruses expressing Ang1 (Ad-Ang1) or a control gene encoding green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP), or recombinant Ang1 protein, BowAng1, was administered to mice before <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), the brain tissue content of Evans Blue, and ischemic lesion volume were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of Ang1 (183+/-31.9 microg/ml, n=4) were detected in mice receiving Ad-Ang1 or in mice treated with BowAng1 (262+/-35.4 microg/ml, n=7) but not in the control mice (n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, mice receiving Ad-GFP (n=8) or control protein (n=7) showed large Evans Blue leakage in the ipsilateral hemisphere (0.46+/-0.05 or 0.55+/-0.16 ng/mg tissue) whereas mice receiving Ad-Ang1 (n=6) or BowAng1 (n=7) had significantly (P&lt;0.05) less Evans Blue leakage (0.26+/-0.07 or 0.14+/-0.03 ng/mg tissue) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infusion of recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor (rhVEGF(165)) to ischemic mice resulted in significant (P&lt;0.05) increases in Evans Blue leakage (1.24+/-0.34 ng/mg tissue, n=7) compared with the control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, infusion of rhVEGF(165) in ischemic mice receiving Ad-Ang1 did not significantly increase Evans Blue dye in the ipsilateral hemisphere (0.22+/-0.06 ng/mg tissue, n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> mice receiving Ad-Ang1 had a significantly smaller ischemic lesion volume (22.6+/-2.7%, n=8) than the lesion volume in mice receiving Ad-GFP (44.7+/-3.7%, n=8), although rCBF reduced to approximately 20% of the contralateral levels in both groups of mice 10 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that Ang1 reduces <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage in ischemic brain and consequently decreases ischemic lesion volume </plain></SENT>
