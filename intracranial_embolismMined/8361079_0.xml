<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We measured mean blood flow velocity (MFV) and Fourier pulsatility index (PI) of the M1 portion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) by transcranial Doppler mapping technique (2 MHz, Trans-scan, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e> Co., Ltd.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The correlations between these parameters and arteriosclerotic risk factors such as aging, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Healthy volunteers as well as patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 59 persons (85 MCAs) consisting of 30 males (mean age 54.4, 24-81 years) and 29 females (mean age 54.8, 20-75 years) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some hypertensive or diabetic subjects had previous cerebrovascular disease, therefore cases who had only minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or asymptomatic infarction without significant lesions in carotid artery system were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e>, these subjects were divided into three groups as normotensive/non diabetic group (NT/non DM), hypertensive group (HT) and diabetic group (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In each group, MFV decreased with aging, being more evident in the HT and DM groups than in the NT/non DM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourier PI also showed a significant increase with aging, and the correlation was stronger than that between MFV and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these trends of age-Fourier PI relationship were more highly significant in HT and DM groups than NT/non DM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cases with HT or DM, age-related arterial changes appeared to be more severe than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourier PI seemed valuable for detecting arterial lesions with aging, HT and DM </plain></SENT>
