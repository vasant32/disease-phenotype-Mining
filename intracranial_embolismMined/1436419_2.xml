<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of U74006F in reducing cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was investigated in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each animal received either U74006F (3.0 mg/kg immediately before and 2 hr after embolization, n = 8) or vehicle control (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematocrit, mean arterial pressure, PCO2, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi>, and pH were measured and controlled both before and after the administration of an autologous clot into one internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (in ml/100 g/min, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) measured by hydrogen clearance was similar in both groups, being reduced from 68.2 +/- 9.6 to 5.2 +/- 1.9 in the control group immediately after clot embolization and from 73.3 +/- 14.9 to 7.0 +/- 1.7 in the U74006F group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four hours after embolization the brain was harvested and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined using the triphenyl-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> technique (% hemisphere, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the U74006F-treated group, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) to 14.8 +/- 6.4 from a control value of 36.0 +/- 6.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, cerebral blood flow values after embolization were consistently higher in the U74006F group, although the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This data suggests that the 21-aminosteroid U74006F may have a protective effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
