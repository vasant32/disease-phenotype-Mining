<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen animals underwent cannulation of the facial artery and a preembolus angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autologous blood clots were then injected, and occlusion of the internal carotid artery at the circle of Willis was documented with repeat angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental group received a 1-mg/kg intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> via a femoral catheter for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A control group received an equivalent volume of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiograms were performed every 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-treated animals showed progressive improvement in flow through previously occluded vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time-density curves of the contrast material over the middle cerebral artery trunk and brain parenchyma were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The best integrated curves for the two groups were compared at 30 minutes after occlusion and 90 minutes after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals were then observed for 24 hours and their neurological status was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Premortem infusion of either Evans blue dye or neutral red dye was performed and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and tissue perfusion were assessed by video planometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements were noted by DSA, and Evans blue and neutral red dye studies in animals treated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
