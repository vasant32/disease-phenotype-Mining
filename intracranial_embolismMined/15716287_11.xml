<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this prospective study were to determine the frequency and composition of catheterization-related cerebral microemboli and to detect cerebral morphological changes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> due to catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-seven unselected patients undergoing elective left heart catheterization, either by transradial or by transfemoral access, were monitored for cerebral microemboli using multifrequency transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging sequences and neuropsychological assessments were carried out on the day before and the day after catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A median number of 754 cerebral microemboli were detected: 92.1% were gaseous and 7.9% were solid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> were observed in 15.2% of the transradial, but none of the transfemoral, catheterization patients (P=0.567) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These lesions were significantly associated with a higher number of solid microemboli (P=0.016) and a longer fluoroscopy time (P=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also a significantly higher number of solid microemboli during transradial than during transfemoral catheterization (P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> following the investigations was associated with the degree of pre-catheterization cerebral MRI injury (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During left heart catheterization, cerebral microemboli, especially those which are solid, may damage the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization may therefore pose a greater risk for the brain than previously acknowledged </plain></SENT>
