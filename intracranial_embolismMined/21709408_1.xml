<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A major concern with carotid artery stenting (CAS) is the potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) can predict the risk of a silent ischemic lesion after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed CAS in 45 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before CAS, we assessed plaque characteristics by VH-IVUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also performed diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain before and after CAS to detect newly appearing ipsilateral silent ischemic lesions (NISIL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the patient group that was positive for NISIL (P group: n = 18), the relative fibrofatty (FF) area identified by VH-IVUS in 5 cross-sections including the most stenotic lesion was significantly larger than that in areas of the NISIL-negative group (N group: n = 27; 32.7 ± 13.2 and 18.3 ± 9.8%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative fibrous area was significantly lower in the P group than in the N group (59.2 ± 9.5 and 74.6 ± 9.1%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the relative dense calcium and necrotic core areas between the P and N groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves, most reliable cutoff values for predicting NISIL were a relative FF area of 30% in the most stenotic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the relative FF area was an independent predictor of NISIL (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative tissue characterization of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of carotid arteries using VH-IVUS was useful to predict NISIL after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the positive predictive value determined by VH-IVUS was not superior to that determined by a noninvasive method </plain></SENT>
