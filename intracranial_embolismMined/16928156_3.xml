<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of 2 emboli protection devices in preventing embolization during carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The GuardWire distal occlusion system (n=19) and the distal FilterWire EX (n=12) were compared in 31 consecutive patients (24 men; mean age 71+/-10 years) monitored with transcranial Doppler for microembolic signals before, during, and after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The choice of the protection device was based on availability and on the patency of the contralateral carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were similar in the patients treated under protection from either device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Placement and retrieval of the protection device, stenting, and postdilation were technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> shortly after the procedure; no other adverse cardiovascular events occurred at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to the GuardWire, the use of the FilterWire was associated with more microembolic signals during stent deployment (77.4+/-33.5 versus 1.07+/-1.94, p&lt;0.0001), postdilation (63.9+/-21.0 versus 2.06+/-2.58, p&lt;0.0001), and retrieval of the protection device (21.4+/-15.4 versus 10.9+/-8.3, p=0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the total amount of microembolic signals during the procedure was higher when the filter device was employed (183.0+/-42.1 versus 31.7+/-12.0, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The distal occlusion device appears to be more effective than the filter in reducing distal embolization detected by transcranial Doppler monitoring </plain></SENT>
