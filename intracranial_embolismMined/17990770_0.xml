<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2001 to December 2005, 86 patients (19 males, 67 females; age, 57-78 years; average, 66 years) with the knees of varus deformity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contracture</z:hpo> underwent primary TKA and the balancing of the soft tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The unibilateral affection was found in 68 patients and the bilateral affection in 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The varus deformity angle was averaged 12.3 degrees (range, 6-34 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The soft tissue varus accounted for 56.7% and the bony varus accounted for 43.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contracture</z:hpo> &lt; 10 degrees was found in 21 knees, 10-19 degrees in 45 knees, 20-29 degrees in 22 knees, and &gt; 30 degrees in 16 knees, with an average angle of 18.9 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contractures</z:hpo> were improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Before operation the average angle of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contracture</z:hpo> was 18.9 degrees but after operation only 4 patients had a residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contracture</z:hpo> of 5 degrees and the remaining patients had a complete correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The follow-up for 37 months (range, 6-72 months) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients revealed that only 6 patients had a residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contracture</z:hpo> of 5-10 degrees and the others had a full extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Before operation the average varus angle was 12.3 degrees (range, 6-34 degrees) and the average tibiofemoral angle was 174.7 degrees (range, 170.3-175.6 degrees), but after operation the residual varus angle &gt; 3 degrees was only found in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The complications occurring during operation and after operation were found in 6 patients, injuries to the attachment of the medial collateral ligaments in 2, patellar clunk syndromes in 2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in 1, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in 1, with no nerve disorders left after the medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, the cut edge <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The balancing of the soft tissues is a major management for correction of the varus deformity and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contracture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The proper balancing of the soft tissues can achieve an obvious recovery of the function and correction of the varus deformity after TKA </plain></SENT>
