<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications (NC) were categorized according to Pruitt definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurologic accidents were observed in 48 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were the first clinical manifestation in 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic events were of poor prognosis in BE, mortality increasing from 26% in patients without NC to 83% in patients with NC (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two factors affect the incidence of NC: first, the location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> with 76% of NC in mitral valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> compared with 37% in other cases (P less than 0.005); and second the infecting organism: 71% of NC in staphylococcus aureus <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> versus 45% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> with other bacteria (P less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral embolism</z:e> was the most common NC (25 cases) related to an occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in 21 cases with a fatal outcome in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other NC included 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> with the evidence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 4 cases, 6 septic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, 2 macroscopic abscesses, and 2 multiple microscopic abscesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study emphasizes the high rate and severity of NC in staphylococcal mitral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> despite antibiotic therapy and supports early surgery in this group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
