<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: A population-based descriptive epidemiological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> residents of a geographically defined segment of the Perth metropolitan area (estimated population 138,708 persons) who had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> between 20 February 1989 and 19 August 1990, inclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The following subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were classified according to standard clinical, radiological and pathological criteria: types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, namely, large artery (thrombotic) occlusive infarction (LAOI), cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> (EMBI), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LACI) and boundary zone infarction (BZI); primary intracerebral haemorrhage (PICH); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the 18-month study period 536 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events were registered, of which 86% (95% confidence interval, 83%-89%) had a defined "pathological" diagnosis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging or necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> accounted for 71% of cases (95% CI, 68%-75%), PICH 11% (95% CI, 9%-14%) and SAH 4% (95% CI, 2%-5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 382 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> included LAOI (in approximately 71%), EMBI (15%), LACI (10%) and BZI (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increased with age, there were age and sex differences in their proportional frequency, management and prognosis: patients with PICH, SAH and EMBI were more likely to be admitted to hospital, and these conditions carried the highest early case fatality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, the 28-day case fatality was 24% (95% CI, 20%-28%), but varied from 0 for LACI and BZI, to 37% (95% CI, 15%-59%) for SAH and 35% (CI, 23%-47%) for PICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found considerable differences in incidence rates, the effect of age and sex on incidence rates, and prognosis for the different subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hospital-based studies are likely to be selectively biased by emphasising <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that are severe and require admission to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data have important implications in the design and evaluation of clinical trials of therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
