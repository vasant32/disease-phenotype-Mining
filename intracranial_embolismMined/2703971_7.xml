<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine whether naftidrofuryl oxalate (Naftidrofuryl) may exert a beneficial effect on the cerebral mitochondria after microsphere-induced embolism assessed under in vitro conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, 600 microspheres (48 microns in diameter) were injected into the right carotid canal of rats, which induced an irreversible embolism in the right cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three days after the operation, the cerebral mitochondria were isolated and their oxidative phosphorylation ability and succinate dehydrogenase activity were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two types of mitochondria were obtained after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>: one was mitochondria which revealed a marked decline in the oxidative phosphorylation activity when measured in the presence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> or succinate as a substrate (severely injured mitochondria), and the other, those which revealed a decrease in the activity in the presence of succinate and an appreciable increase in the activity in the presence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (mildly injured mitochondria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Naftidrofuryl at the concentration of 3 microM elicited slight but significant restoration of the oxidative phosphorylation ability of the mildly injured mitochondria isolated from rats after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, but not of the severely injured mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The succinate dehydrogenase activity of the brain mitochondria isolated from rats 3 days after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure of these mitochondria to 0.1 to 1 microM Naftidrofuryl significantly restored the succinate dehydrogenase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that Naftidrofuryl is capable of exerting a beneficial effect in vitro on the brain mitochondria activity impaired by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, particularly on the activity of mildly injured mitochondria </plain></SENT>
