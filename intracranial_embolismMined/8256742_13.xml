<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings of this group were compared with those of 772 consecutive patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiographic evaluation for indications other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study also examined this group of patients with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> to determine differences in relation to underlying cardiac rhythm and patient age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Intracardiac thrombus</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, spontaneous left atrial contrast and protruding debris in the thoracic aorta were found more often in patients with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Wall motion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001711'>abnormalities of the left ventricle</z:hpo>, as well as mild to moderate valvular lesions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, were found to be similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous left atrial contrast, as well as mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormalities</z:hpo>, were found more often in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (22% of the group with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> was no more frequent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients aged &gt; 50 years were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and larger left atrial size more often than their younger cohorts, as well as a greater incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormalities</z:hpo> and left ventricular wall motion abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was seen more frequently in the younger cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
