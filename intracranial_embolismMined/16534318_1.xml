<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review is a survey of the recent literature investigating the etiology and the relative incidence of postoperative neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies reviewed here have employed transcranial Doppler for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and compared results between patients undergoing beating-heart versus conventional cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A transcranial Doppler device ostensibly discriminating between particulate and gaseous emboli has additionally been employed, yet despite a consistently lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> associated with avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass, several groups have reported similar incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> across these procedures, suggesting other, potentially more important, factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two recent studies have focused on the hazards associated with perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in both infants and older patients, and which can result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> or profound changes in cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A further study has identified an adverse interaction with postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of intraortic filtration for capture and removal of particulate macroemboli has been associated with a reduction in the incidence of clinically apparent central-<z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp>-system injury and should be further investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several other studies identify pre-existing levels of central-<z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp>-system impairment prior to surgery, underscoring the confounding issues introduced by the failure to include a non-surgical comparator group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: While further evidence of cerebral embolization continues to accrue, several studies suggest that other factors may be of equal or greater importance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further investigations into the role of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, co-incident hypoxemia and other aspects of perioperative care, e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, are warranted </plain></SENT>
