<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data was obtained by a retrospective review of a prospective registry of consecutive cases of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> treated at a single institution from 2002 to mid 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, number, location, and size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, calcification, mode of treatment, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score, presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on post-op imaging, and GOS were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical 9.4 for PC was utilized for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 225 procedures performed in 208 patients to treat 252 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 54.6 years, 74.5% were female, the mean <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score was 2.45, and 72.2% were smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size was 8.6 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 157 (70%) craniotomies and 68 (30%) coiling procedures were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coiling was utilized more frequently in the posterior circulation [18/32 (56%) posterior circulation, 50/193 (29.9%) anterior circulation, p &lt; 0.001 Chi-square] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Length of hospital stay averaged 5.3 days [6.2 vs. 3.2 clip/coil, p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall favorable outcome of GOS 4-5 measured at 6 months post-procedure was 93.3% [145/157 (92.3%) clip, 66/68 (97%) coil, p = 0.3 Chi-square], with a single mortality in the coil group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was radiographic evidence of a post-procedure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on CT in 31 (13.8%) [28/157 (17.8%) clip, 3/68 (4.4%) coil, p &lt; 0.001, Chi-square], but only 11(35%) were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> long-term morbidity was attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> except for one case of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Utilizing a logistic regression multivariate analysis (forward), none of the examined factors (age, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score, sex, surgeon, posterior circulation, number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated at one sitting, size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, smoking status, or type of therapy) related to outcome except calcified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> [20/25 (80%) calcified, 191/200 (95.5%) non-calcified, p &lt; 0.01 Chi-square] with an OR = 7.8 (2.2-28.4, 95% C.I.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although a univariate analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size versus outcome achieves statistical significance [p = 0.05, logistic regression (forced)], when the calcified cases are removed from consideration, it does not [p = 0.55, OR = .95, (.82-1.1), 95% C.I.] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Excluding patients with calcified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> resulted in the following calculation of favorable outcome: 94.2% (130/138) clip and 98.4% (61/62) coil [p = 0.33, Chi-square] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the presence of calcification in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was the sole marker of adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> tended to be more likely to be calcified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Size by itself did not have an adverse affect on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Clipping or clip reconstruction of calcified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is a significant source of morbidity in the treatment of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (Odds ratio 7.8) </plain></SENT>
