<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical data of 344 patients, together with the short-term outcome of the disease, are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immediate (one month) overall mortality was 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding percentage for cerebral haemorrhage was 86, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> 20 and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the surviving patients, 111 had to be transferred to some form of institution at discharge after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase; 103 were able to return to their homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The influence of various factors upon the immediate prognosis is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the clinical findings, the level of consciousness and a calculated score based on the neurological symptoms on admission, proved to have the highest predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using this score it was possible to predict the outcome in about 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Single factors very highly associated with a poor prognosis were the co-existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a notably high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
