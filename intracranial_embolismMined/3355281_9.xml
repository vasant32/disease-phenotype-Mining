<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>Aortic stenosis</z:hpo> accounts for 5 to 6% of infants and children seen for surgical repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation and reported results of operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> are highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective review was undertaken to assess our operative mortality and the degree of gradient reduction afforded by each of several surgical techniques used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> in children over a 30-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred fifty-seven patients ranging in age from 1 day to 19 years were operated on between 1957 and 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indication for operation included asymptomatic patients with gradients greater than 50 mm Hg to patients in profound cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality for children older than 6 months was 4%, whereas neonates seen with critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> had a 60% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The late mortality was 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of surviving patients to date have undergone cardiac catheterization after repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This shows an overall reduction of 57 mm Hg in the left ventricular-aortic gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004381'>supravalvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo> and discrete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001682'>subvalvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo> as well as patients undergoing aortic valve replacement showed a reduction in or elimination of associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, whereas patients undergoing aortic valvotomy or neonates having valvotomy had a significant increase in demonstrable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of third-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> following operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> was less than 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> following repair was nearly 5%; six of eleven cases occurred in the group with discrete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001682'>subvalvular aortic stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine (13%) of the 223 long-term survivors have undergone a subsequent procedure for relief of residual or recurrent obstruction; 12 have had insertion of an aortic valve prosthesis, 12 have had insertion of an apicoaortic conduit, and 6 have required repeat aortic valvotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate the low operative mortality and excellent hemodynamic benefit of surgical relief of single-level <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> in children older than neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conduits placed for complex obstructions or operative procedures in neonates have acceptable hemodynamic benefits, but operative mortality remains high </plain></SENT>
