<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Intracranial pressure increased</z:e> from 6.1 +/- 1.5 to 14 +/- 2.3 mm Hg within two minutes and continued to rise more slowly to 24 +/- 18.3 mm Hg within four hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Embolization caused a nonhomogenous distribution of microflow, but initially had no effect on global cerebral blood flow, nor on cortical oxygen tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Yet, a functional suppression of cortical electrical and metabolic activity occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral EEG flattened irreversibly after 15 seconds; the contralateral EEG was transiently suppressed shortly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arteriovenous difference of oxygen fell from 10.5 +/- 0.7 to 5.3 +/- 0.6 vol%, and the arteriovenous difference of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fell from 11.7 +/- 3.9 to 2.6 +/- 2.1 mg/100 ml as a consequence of reduced oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> extraction </plain></SENT>
