<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lesions in the centrum ovale may be classified as microangiopathic (lacunar) lesions and hemodynamic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To distinguish between them, a size of more than 2 cm has been postulated for hemodynamic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reliability of this criterion was assessed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 16 patients with unilateral or bilateral occlusion or high-grade stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA), <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> testing revealed an ipsilateral hemodynamic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each hemisphere in these patients was assessed separately for the presence and size of centrum ovale lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of the 16 patients suffered from large cortical infarctions with a probable embolic pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 11 patients (22 hemispheres), a hemodynamic failure was found in 15 hemispheres, due to occlusion (13 hemispheres) or high-grade ICA stenosis (two hemispheres) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging revealed centrum ovale infarctions with a size of more than 2 cm in three of the 15 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In eight hemispheres, multiple small lesions (&lt; 1.5 cm; three to 30 per hemisphere) could be found with a rosarylike or sickle-shaped distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In none of these eight cases did <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images show <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> in the typical regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results favor the assumption that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> finding of multiple small (&lt; 1.5 cm) rosarylike lesions in the centrum ovale seems to be typical in patients with hemodynamic failure due to severe ICA disease </plain></SENT>
