<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (TA) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> of unknown etiology that can affect the aorta and its branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in TA can be caused by a variety of mechanisms, and the focus of this study is to detect the possible contribution of microembolus in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients with TA according to the criteria for the classification of TA of the American College of Rheumatology and 100 age-matched healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both middle cerebral arteries were monitored by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound for at least 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with TA were followed up for a mean duration of 2.1 months, and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) were present in 22% of the patients overall, and the intensity of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> varied between 9 and 30 dB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were found in 30% of the patients with higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two (67%) of 3 patients who did not receive any treatment had <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, but only 2 (13%) of 15 patients who received immunosuppressive and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy before the TCD ultrasonography monitoring had <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period after <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> recording, we did not observe any recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD ultrasonography monitoring can be used as an additional noninvasive procedure to detect microembolus in patients with TA during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The monitoring of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> may also help in choosing better treatment for the long-term prophylaxis of the disease from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but further large studies are required to justify the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment in these patients </plain></SENT>
