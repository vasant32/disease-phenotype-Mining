<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Introduction: <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">Carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (CO) is one of the leading causes of poisoning; it inhibits oxygen delivery, subsequently causing ischemic changes and ultimately <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, thromboembolic episodes due to CO poisoning have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> formation following exposure to CO has been very rarely described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, a case of right atrial large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation after CO poisoning is presented.Case presentation: A previously healthy 24-year-old woman was referred for CO poisoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038663" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">attempted suicide</z:e>, and her initial mental status was drowsy with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her initial CO fraction was 16%, and initial laboratory data showed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> kinase-myocardial bound of 90.6 ng/mL (upper limit 5 ng/mL) and troponin I of 1.899 ng/mL (upper limit 1.5 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A transthoracic echocardiography was performed 24 h after the accident, revealing a 30 15 mm nodular echogenic mass in the right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was started along with hyperbaric oxygen therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 7 days of heparinization, the large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in right atrium had resolved.Conclusion: This report describes an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> formation induced by CO poisoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> can result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> and cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e>, its consideration following CO poisoning is important </plain></SENT>
