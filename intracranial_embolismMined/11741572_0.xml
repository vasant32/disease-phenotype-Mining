<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported the low yield of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in unselected patients with a suspected cardiac source of embolism and the questionable effect on management decisions in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these studies, patients with a prosthetic valve (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) were excluded, but such patients pose a significant diagnostic challange in routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography has a limited role in patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, particularly in the mitral position, and TEE has repeatedly been shown to be superior to transthoracic echocardiography for assessing prosthetic valvular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are few data on TEE findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> patients with a suspected cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these patients, TEE may have a higher yield than in a patient with a suspected cardiac source of emboli without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken (1) to evaluate the yield of TEE for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> and suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, and (2) to assess the utility of TEE findings in their management </plain></SENT>
