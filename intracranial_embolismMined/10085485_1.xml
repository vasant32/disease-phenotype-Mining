<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of atherosclerotic debris in the ascending aorta or aortic arch detected by transesophageal echocardiography or epiaortic echocardiography has been well established to be correlated with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No data are available on the role of TTE in describing aortic pathology in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 60 transthoracic echocardiographic studies from 11,275 studies, in which STAD was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The charts of these patients (group 1; mean age 67 +/- 10 years) were reviewed and compared with those of 57 patients (group 2) without STAD, matched for age, gender and risk factors for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of brain imaging procedures, carotid duplex and coronary angiography were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was found in 15 of group 1 (25%) and 4 patients of group 2 (7%, odds ratio = 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-19.4, p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average thickness of STAD was 0.7 +/- 0.2 cm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 0.6 +/- 0.2 cm in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p = n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>STAD was associated with &lt;/=40% carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: STAD detected by TTE is strongly associated with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings expand the role of TTE in the evaluation of patients with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
