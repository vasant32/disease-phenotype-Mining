<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relation between the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> and the development of complications and cardiac events by using two-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiography in 229 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of moderate and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was significantly higher in patients with a prolapsed posterior leaflet (61%) than in patients with a prolapsed anterior leaflet (25%), and the older the patient, the greater the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of complications, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and chordal rupture, was significantly greater in prolapsed posterior leaflet cases than in prolapsed anterior leaflet cases, and the occurrence was closely associated with the degree of severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> is a strong prognostic indicator for developing complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore in a subgroup of 49 patients tracked for a mean of 4.8 years, the new development of complications was significantly higher in patients who showed a progression in the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (52%) that in patients without progression in severity (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was related to the occurrence of cardiac events (mitral valve replacement, infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data indicated that the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> is closely associated with the development of complications and cardiac events and suggest that the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> is an important prognostic indicator for the development of complications and cardiac events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
