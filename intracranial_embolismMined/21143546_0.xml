<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: There have been some reports on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> as a cause of cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although contrast transcranial Doppler (c-TCD) can detect RLS, an insufficient temporal window has occasionally restricted its applicability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we compared the rates of detecting RLS among temporal windows for the middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) and the orbital window for the internal carotid artery (ICA) on c-TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used c-TCD to detect RLS in patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We enrolled patients who had both sufficient bilateral temporal windows for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> and a right orbital window for ICA and performed c-TCD using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three windows simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We enrolled 106 consecutive patients and identified microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in 30 (28%) of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these 30 patients, 15 had <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When these 30 patients were defined as being positive for RLS, the rates of detection were 67%, 73%, and 80% from the right temporal, left temporal, and right orbital windows, respectively (P= .795) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The right orbital window as well as the temporal window for c-TCD could detect RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insonation from the orbital window should be useful for patients who lack temporal windows </plain></SENT>
