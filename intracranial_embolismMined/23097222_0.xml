<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No data exist in patients under continued oral anticoagulation during the ablation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to quantify the amount of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> assessed by pre-procedural and post-procedural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients under therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) and to identify clinical or procedural parameters that correlate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 131 consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation for paroxysmal (n = 80, 61.1%) or persistent (n = 51, 38.9%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVI), roofline, mitral isthmus line, and complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) ablation using 3.5 mm open-irrigated tip catheters were performed, as needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent pre-procedural and post-procedural cerebral MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-procedural MRI revealed new embolic lesions in 16 patients (12.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical parameters showing a significant correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in univariate analysis were age (P = 0.027), persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (vs. paroxysmal; P = 0.039), and spontaneous echo contrast in transesophageal echocardiography (P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant procedural parameters were electric cardioversion (P = 0.041), PVI only (P = 0.008), and ablation of complex atrial electrograms (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors in multivariate analysis were age (P = 0.009), spontaneous echo contrast (P = 0.029) and CFAE ablation (P = 0.006).CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency ablation in patients under continued oral therapeutic anticoagulation is associated with a substantial risk of silent embolism detected by cerebral MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, continuation of oral anticoagulation is not able to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A variety of different clinical and procedural factors seem to contribute to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
