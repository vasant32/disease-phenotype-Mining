<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of 490 consecutive patients (365 men; mean age 70.7+/-8.5 years) who underwent CAS with EPD between January 1999 and December 2007 at 2 institutions with large referral practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 163 symptomatic patients with stenosis &gt;or=50% and 327 asymptomatic patients with &gt;or=80% diameter stenosis treated in 536 CAS procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nearly a quarter (116, 23.7%) of the cohort had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-risk surgical features were present in 141 (28.8%): 73 (14.9%) aged &gt;or=80 years, 25 (5.1%) with significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, 23 (4.6%) with postsurgical restenosis, and 16 (3.2%) with contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An EPD was successfully placed in 512 (95.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 30 days was 3.3% (16/490), of which the majority (13, 2.6%) were ipsilateral [5 (1.0%) major and 8 (1.6%) minor] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of major adverse events (MAE), i.e., any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, within 30 days was 3.7% (18/490); the incidence of 30-day any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 3.7% (18/490), while the cumulative incidence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 1 year was 6.1% (30/490) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic patients, the 30-day MAE rate was 6.7% (11/163) versus 2.1% (7/237) in the asymptomatic group (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A subgroup analysis based on surgical risk showed that the 30-day MAE rate was similar between high-risk and non-high-risk patients [4.9% (7/144) versus 3.2% (11/346); p = 0.5] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this large real-world cohort, CAS with routine use of EPDs was technically feasible, clinically safe, and associated with a low rate of periprocedural and 1-year events; results were similar irrespective of surgical risk </plain></SENT>
