<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases included had embolic occlusion of middle cerebral or internal carotid arteries which showed no abnormal findings on initial CT corresponding to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> events but did show abnormal CBF reduction on initial single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative rCBF was evaluated as the percentage radioisotope counts in the region of interest (ROI) of the affected side against the corresponding ROI in the unaffected contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 6 hours from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, there was a tendency towards reversed time dependent tolerance of cortical infarction with residual relative rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic transformation was observed in one case whose relative rCBF was 35% or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients whose occluded arteries were not recanalized within 6 hours, cortical areas with residual relative rCBF of 70% or more did not develop infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusions, a pre-therapeutic rCBF study using SPECT is considered to be mandatory: cases with moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> involving the cortex with residual relative rCBF of between 35% and 70% may be good candidates for local fibrinolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
