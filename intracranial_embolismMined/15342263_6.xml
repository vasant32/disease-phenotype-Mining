<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study of biomarkers associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has proved to be of considerable utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The astroglial protein S-100b is a candidate marker for cerebral tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a rat embolic model produced by injection of microspheres to demonstrate that serum S-100b is a useful biochemical marker for ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum S-100b levels were significantly increased following microsphere injection, which was closely correlated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that structurally and mechanistically independent neuroprotective agents, such as 3-[2-[4-(3-chloro-2-methylphenylmethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-5,6-dimethoxy-1-(4-imidazolylmethyl)-1H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36669,36671">indazole</z:chebi> dihydrochloride 3.5 hydrate (DY-9760e), a novel calmodulin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, and the N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801, are capable of attenuating increased serum S-100b levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the hyperosmolar agent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, which has no direct neuroprotective action, had little effect on serum S-100b levels, despite a significant decrease in brain water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that lowering of serum S-100b is mediated by neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, serum S-100b reflects the extent of brain damage following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and serves as a useful biomarker for the assessment of neuroprotectants </plain></SENT>
