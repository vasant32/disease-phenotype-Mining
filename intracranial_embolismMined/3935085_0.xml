<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients having presented a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> cardiac origin underwent a standard work up which included clinical examination, ECG, chest X-ray and 2D echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other investigations were carried out in some patients: CT cardiac scan (11 cases), gamma scintigraphy with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi> III labelled platelets (6 cases) and angiocardiography (12 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of an embolic cardiac lesion was made after the standard investigations in 82% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 18% of cases hall had echocardiographic abnormalities and enable the diagnosis of clinically imapparent conditions: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the interatrial septum, valvular calcification and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A potentially embolic mass was visualised in 18 patients; 6 valvular vegetations, 12 left atrial or ventricular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other specialised radionuclide, angiographic and CT investigations only confirmed the echocardiographic diagnosis of intravavitary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed surgically in 19% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study shows that complementary investigations especially echocardiography, allow diagnosis of latent embolic cardiac lesions, some of which may benefit from surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, potentially embolic intracardiac masses may be visualised, so confirming the origin of systemic emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When surgery is not indicated, echocardiography is a good method of following up the results of medical treatment in some of these masses </plain></SENT>
