<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study was designed by the French National Health Insurance Fund for Salaried Workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To ensure objectivity, data were retrieved at each center and checked by a team of medical advisors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between June 1999 and May 2001, a total of 166 stent-graft repairs for thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> were performed in 166 patients, mainly by surgeons in the operating room (88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists as status I or II in 24% of cases, status III in 56%, and status IV or V in 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was less than 50 mm in 17% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (10%) died during the first 3 months, including 8 within the first 30 days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 49 complications were noted in 34 patients (20.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endoleaks occurred in 27 patients (16.3%), including 8 that necessitated further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other stent-related complications included rupture (n = 3), aortoesophageal or tracheal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (n = 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> (n = 6), stent migration (n = 2), visceral embolism (n = 5), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 14 delivery-related complications (8%) at the catheterization site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Non-stent-related complications occurred in 14 (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study demonstrates that stent-graft repair for thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> can be performed with acceptable postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, it is not a risk-free procedure and should continue to be used in an investigative setting </plain></SENT>
