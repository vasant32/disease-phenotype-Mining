<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identifying risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is important to define the risks of this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> neurologic complications were analyzed in a prospective database of patients in thoracic aortic stent graft trials from 1999 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial neurological examination was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was defined as any new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> focal neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The TEVAR was performed on 171 patients; 52 had lesions requiring coverage of the proximal descending thoracic aorta (extent A), 50 requiring coverage of the distal descending aorta (extent B), and 69 requiring coverage of the entire descending thoracic aorta (extent C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 5.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine percent (8 of 9) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred within 24 hours of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was associated with a 33% in-hospital mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk factors identified for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> included prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 9.4, confidence interval [CI] 2.3 to 38.1, p = 0.002) and extent A or C coverage (OR 5.5, CI 1.7-12.5, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in patients with both prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and extent A or C coverage was 27.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Severe atheromatous disease involving the aortic arch by computed tomographic scan was strongly associated with perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR = 14.8, CI 1.7 to 675.6, p = 0.0016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated mobile atheroma in two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> after TEVAR was associated with a high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The TEVAR of the proximal descending aorta (extent A or C) in patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had the highest perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These risk factors, together with high grade aortic atheroma of the aortic arch, predicted a high probability for cerebral embolization and can be used to identify patients at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as a consequence of TEVAR </plain></SENT>
