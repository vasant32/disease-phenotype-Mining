<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally thought that fat droplets enter the circulation at the site of fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the systemic circulation, they become emboli to brain, kidney and other areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipids</z:chebi> are absorbed from the intestinal tract and transported into pulmonary tissue via thoracic duct and exposed to first catabolic procedures in the lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have predicted that systemic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> embolism may not occur unless bone fractures lead to pulmonary injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study was planned to investigate this hypothesis with respect to the role of pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> and long bone fractures in the formation of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty male hybrid rabbits were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> was performed on half of the rabbits (n = 10) and femur fracture was applied to the remaining ones (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten days after procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rabbits were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain specimens were taken by frozen-section method and stained with Sudan black </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraarteriolar <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> particles in the brain were examined microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> was detected in seven animals exposed to pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> and only in one animal exposed to femur fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean number of branches of middle cerebral artery at midparietal level occluded with fat particles were higher in the pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> group than in the long bone fracture group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found that pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> had more deleterious effects than long bone fracture in the formation of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
