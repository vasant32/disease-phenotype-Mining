<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, even in high-risk patients, can be reduced significantly by adequate anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, anticoagulation does not abolish the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate, and unfortunately only 40% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> actually receive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, even in areas where adequate health care is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the past 11.5 years, we have performed the maze procedure for the treatment of medically refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in 306 patients, 58 of whom presented with a history of having had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 40) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (n = 18) before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> are at an increased risk for these complications, but they are especially prevalent in those patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and those with other recognized risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 306 patients who had surgery, there were only 2 perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>7%), and in the 265 patients followed for up to 11.5 years after the maze procedure, there has been only 1 late minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that has now completely resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ability of the maze procedure to decrease the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> so dramatically is likely due to the restoring of sinus rhythm and atrial transport function in combination with surgical removal or obliteration of the left atrial appendage, where most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> develop </plain></SENT>
