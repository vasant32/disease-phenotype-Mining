<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We carried out a retrospective analysis into the possible uses of thrombotic drugs on 190 consecutive patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who had been admitted to the Neurological Service of the Barcelona 'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau' in accordance with exclusion criteria commonly accepted for the use of this type of medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We thus analyzed the initial symptoms, type of instauration, etiological diagnosis and topographical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In those patients who could be possible candidates for such treatment with these drugs we assessed their disability variations (on the Rankin scale) at the end of two weeks using currently available therapeutic means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>70% of patients would subsequently be excluded from our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among reasons for exclusion were especially minor neurological deficiencies, age and latency time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As for patients included, most predominant factors were immediate instauration, cardioembolic etiological mechanism and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> symptomatology (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor disorder</z:e>, awareness and language abnormalities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a substantial spontaneous improvement in 7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This fact is especially clear in cardioemboligenic etiology patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bearing the spontaneous improvement cases in mind, we concluded that some 23% of patients with ischaemic cerebrovascular pathology could benefit from thrombotic drugs in our milieu </plain></SENT>
