<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Off-pump CABG (OPCABG) reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates by minimizing aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the effect of different levels of aortic manipulation on neurologic outcomes after CABG surgery was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1998 to June 2002, 7,272 patients underwent isolated CABG surgery through three levels of aortic manipulation: full plus tangential (side-biting) aortic clamp application (on-pump surgery; n = 4,269), only tangential aortic clamp application (OPCABG surgery; n = 2,527) or an "aortic no-touch" technique (OPCABG surgery; n = 476) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A risk-adjusted logistic regression analysis was performed to establish the likelihood of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with each technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from the literature, and those found significant in a univariable model were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant association for postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> correspondingly increasing with the extent of aortic manipulation was demonstrated by the univariable analysis (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> incidence respectively increasing from 0.8% to 1.6% to a maximum of 2.2%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the logistic regression model, patients who had a full and a tangential aortic clamp applied were 1.8 times more likely to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> versus those without any aortic manipulation (95% confidence interval: 1.15 to 2.74, p &lt; 0.01) and 1.7 times more likely to develop a postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than those with only a tangential aortic clamp applied (95% confidence interval: 1.11 to 2.48, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic manipulation during CABG is a contributing mechanism for postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increases with increased levels of aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
