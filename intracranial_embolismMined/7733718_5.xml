<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in neurologic outcome have been attributed to different cardioplegia techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler-detected microembolic events were recorded during coronary artery bypass grafting using different cardioplegia techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received cold antegrade (n = 20), warm antegrade (n = 17), or warm retrograde (n = 20) cardioplegia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous monitoring was divided into stages: aortic cannulation, initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamping, aortic declamping and decannulation until chest closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rate of embolic events and number of total and immediate embolic events were tabulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total embolic events ranged from 22 to 2,072 per patient and were similar among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate and total at each stage were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total embolic events were highest during aortic clamping; the rate was highest at initiation of bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The immediate embolic events were higher in the warm retrograde group than both antegrade groups at aortic declamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, a high total and rate of embolic events were detected and differences between cardioplegia techniques were detected </plain></SENT>
