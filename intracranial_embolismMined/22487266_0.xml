<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Haemodialysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) circuits are known to produce microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>Patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) may be important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients by allowing right to left intracardiac shunting of microemboli (blood clots or microbubbles), which may pass into the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook bubble contrast transthoracic echocardiography to identify <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients and in a control population of peritoneal dialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We interrogated draining arteriovenous fistulae to confirm that microemboli are created during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then undertook transcranial Doppler scanning of the middle cerebral artery before and during dialysis, with and without Valsalva augmentation, to detect cerebral microemboli in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients and in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty patients (age 60.4 ± 15.0 years) were recruited to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 12 of 51 HD patients and five of 29 peritoneal dialysis patients a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was found (21.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound scanning of draining arteriovenous fistulae showed a significant difference in the number of microemboli before (1.63 ± 3.47 hits per 5 min) and during (31.6 ± 28.9 hits per 5 min) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no evidence of microembolization to the middle cerebral artery before or during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> in the study or control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although microemboli are detectable in the draining arteriovenous fistulae of patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, there was no evidence of cerebral microembolization in the middle cerebral artery during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> in those with or without a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results contrast with previous reports demonstrating microemboli in the carotid circulation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
