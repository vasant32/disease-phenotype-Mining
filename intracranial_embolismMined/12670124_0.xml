<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can lead to severe morbidity or even <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis is a technique that has been extensively used for evaluating localized changes in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The microdialysis probe is only capable of measuring changes in the immediate adjacent tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In arterial gas embolism the changes are multifocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus a probe located in the cerebral cortex will not detect the total amount of damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used microdialysis in the cisterna magna of 9 anaesthetized pigs to study the diffuse injury following arterial gas embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After injection of 5.0 mL of air in the internal carotid artery, we found a significantly increased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio in the cerebrospinal fluid, lasting for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicates anaerobic metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> were significantly increased, indicating membrane disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> levels were also elevated, although not significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The injection of air affected carotid flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Flow in the carotid artery of the side of injection decreased significantly, but returned to baseline in 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Flow in the contralateral carotid was increased, but not significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reduced blood flow in the brain that can be detected in the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
