<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the sources and consequences of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated a total of 140 consecutive patients (93 males, mean age 62.9 years) who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> monitoring was conducted at the basilar artery through the suboccipital window for a 30-minute period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 18 (12.9%) of the 140 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics and laboratory data did not differ between the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-positive and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-negative groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracranial vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) stenosis was independently associated with the presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (odds ratio, 9.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-79.48; P=0.032), whereas the patients with vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> that was limited to the extracranial portion did not show an association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals occurred significantly more frequently in patients with severe degree of VBA stenosis compared to those with nonsignificant stenosis (odds ratio, 9.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-79.07; P=0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup analysis of the 79 patients who had lesions on diffusion-weighted images and relevant VBA stenosis, the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-positive group showed more frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> (P=0.010) and multiple lesion patterns (P=0.007) than single perforating infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, intracranial and severe VBA stenosis is associated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and may be its root causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in VBA stenosis suggests that multiple and embolic type infarctions are the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
