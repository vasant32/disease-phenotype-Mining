<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EmBlocker (Neurosonix Ltd, Rehovot, Israel), a newly developed device should be positioned against the ascending aorta, and it produces an ultrasonic force expected to divert microemboli away from the cerebral vasculature and reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESCRIPTION: Twenty-one consecutive patients, undergoing a valve procedure, were enrolled into this nonrandomized pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EmBlocker (Neurosonix Ltd) was positioned in 11 consecutive patients and activated for 1 minute (1.5 W/cm(2)) during seven selected aortic manipulations and for 10 minutes (0.5 W/cm(2)) intermittently after cross-clamp removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler-based quantification of microembolic signals was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EVALUATION: The use of the EmBlocker showed a significant overall reduction of the cerebral microembolic signals of 53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of the EmBlocker during valve surgeries is associated with a reduction of perioperative cerebral microembolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This new technology holds the potential to lower the risk of postoperative neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
