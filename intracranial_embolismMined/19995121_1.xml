<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the utility of proximal brain protection by flow reversal in endovascular management of critical internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis coexisting with ipsilateral external carotid artery (iECA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Four patients with a symptomatic, critical ICA stenosis (in-stent restenosis in one) and iECA occlusion were admitted for carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the stenosis severity and high-risk lesion <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> precluded the use of filter protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The "tailored" CAS algorithm indicated that a proximal anti-embolism system should be used to maximize the potential for effective neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The flow reversal system, which consists of an independent guiding sheath balloon positioned in the common carotid artery (CCA) and an iECA balloon-wire, was employed, using the CCA balloon only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The system was well-tolerated, and the CAS procedures were uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to a unique design with separate CCA and iECA balloons, the flow reversal system can be used for proximal neuroprotection during CAS in severe, symptomatic ICA lesions coexisting with iECA occlusion </plain></SENT>
