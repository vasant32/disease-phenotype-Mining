<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in the presence of cerebral air emboli, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> impaired cognitive and histological outcome in a rat cardiopulmonary bypass model, a result which is due to the property of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> to expand air bubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The current study was designed to assess whether cerebral outcome in the setting of cardiopulmonary bypass with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> could be altered by administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> restricted to periods when the occurrence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is unlikely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: With institutional review board approval, 40 rats were allocated randomly to one of four groups (n = 10) which determined the period of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> inhalation: 'before', 'during' or 'after' cardiopulmonary bypass or 'none' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Rats were subjected to 90  min of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass combined with 10 small cerebral air emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi> was administered according to group assignment: the 'none' group received no <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>; in the other groups, the lungs were ventilated with 56% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> before, during or after cardiopulmonary bypass and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Motor and cognitive outcomes were tested using the modified hole-board test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> volumes were determined on postoperative day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Animals that received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> after cardiopulmonary bypass and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> had impaired motor function scores [after: median 6.6 (range 0.25-8), before: 0.5 (0-3), during: 1.5 (0.25-2.75), none: 1 (0-1.75)] and cognitive performance [after: 9 (6.5-9), before: 0 (0-5.5), during: 1 (0-5.5), none: 1 (0-4)] compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> after cardiopulmonary bypass and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> also led to larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volumes [after: 74 μl (54-157), before: 45 μl (20-82), during: 33 μl (23-54), none: 22 μl (17-78)] compared with the groups that received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> during cardiopulmonary bypass and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> or no <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi> administered immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> impaired motor, cognitive and histological outcome in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At no time did inhalation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> lead to any beneficial effects on cerebral outcome when compared with inhalation of nitrogen </plain></SENT>
