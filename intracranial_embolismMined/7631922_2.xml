<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients (37 procedures) with symptomatic (n = 35) or asymptomatic (n = 2) internal carotid artery origin stenosis(&gt; 50%) were monitored continuously during carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Special instrumentation was used to detect high-intensity transient signals (HITS) in the middle cerebral artery on the carotid endarterectomy side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> HITS satisfied a priori established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of carotid endarterectomies with formed-element HITS increased at clamp release (23/37, P &lt; 0.001) and shunt opening (7/11, P = 0.014), and during wound closure (13/22, P&lt; 0.005) and shunting (5/11, P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HITS with air microbubble characteristics were detected at clamp release (22/37, P &lt; 0.001) and shunt opening (5/11, P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HITS do not occur randomly during carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Shunting, unclamping, and wound closure are high-risk periods </plain></SENT>
