<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have established a new model of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in rats due to photochemically induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is caused by photochemical reaction between green light and systemic injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> (RB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under anesthesia, the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was observed without cutting the dura mater via a subtemporal craniotomy under an operation microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Photoillumination (wavelength, 540 nm; L4887, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) was applied to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and then RB (20 mg/kg) was administered intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was completely occluded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> about 6 min after the administration of RB with an operation microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effects of antithrombotic agents can be evaluated in this model, since this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> is a typical arterial one caused by the injury of the endothelium, and this method is easy and the location and volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> are reproducible, since <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> is induced at the same portion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally the damage to animals is little, since <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> is induced without cutting the dura mater; furthermore, it is possible to do <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this model is a useful one for investigation of thrombolytic therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
