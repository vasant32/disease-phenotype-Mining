<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The early neuropathological response of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cat brain to photodynamic therapy was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Photofrin II was injected (IV) into a cat and photoactivated with red light from a filtered incandescent lamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were subjected to phototherapy either through the intact skull or with energy deposition onto the intact dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following photoactivation the animals were maintained for 6 h after which time the brain was removed and sections submitted for electron microscopic and or light microscopic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gross anatomical analysis of the photoactivated brain revealed hemorrhagic dusky discoloration limited to the area of the tissue illuminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals that failed to show a lesion were cats characterized by low Photofrin II dosage and low photoactivation intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The microscopic cortical features of cats with lesions included prominent capillary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> and regions of marked vacuolization and rarefaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood vessels were structurally altered and the lumen of many vessels was completely filled with tightly packed erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuropathological response of cerebral tissue to photoactivation resembles that of microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is thus reasonable to explore <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue as a non invasive model of cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the cat </plain></SENT>
