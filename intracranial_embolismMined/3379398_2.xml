<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into three groups according to neurological symptoms: sham-operation group, group A (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> only), and group B (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> with unconsciousness) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Marked ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was detected in the hippocampus on the embolized side and extended to the other regions on the same side in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that this damage in regional energy metabolism arises from regional reduction in blood flow and/or tissue vulnerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATP levels in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and striatum on the opposite side of embolization decreased markedly in group B, and may be caused by extension of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> or diaschisis </plain></SENT>
