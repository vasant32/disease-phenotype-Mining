<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The SAPPHIRE trial has established carotid artery stenting (CAS) in high-surgical-risk patients as an effective alternative to carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the occurrence of distal embolization with CAS is still a major concern, an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection device is usually employed during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the advantage of the filter device is continuation of blood flow during the procedure, blood flow is occasionally reduced due to plaque debris or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a case of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis complicated with filter obstruction during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 74-year-old woman who had a history of coronary artery stenting was referred to our hospital for the treatment of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed occlusion of the right ICA and high-grade stenosis at the origin of the left ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since cerebral circulation was impaired significantly in the left cerebral hemisphere, CAS was performed for the left ICA stenosis using an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Self-expandable stent was placed into the left ICA following predilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient developed consciousness disturbance and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> during postdilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed impairment of blood flow, indicating filter obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The debris containing blood stasis was removed with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> catheter and the flow was restarted retrieving the filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The symptom recovered within one hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Appropriate antithrombotic therapy and preparation for filter obstruction such as the provision of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> catheter are important in CAS using an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> protection filter </plain></SENT>
