<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We sought to determine the prevalence of coexistent occult vascular malformations (OVMs) and developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) and to investigate the relationship between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred two patients with OVMs were examined with precontrast and postcontrast T1-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and with noncontrast T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients had surgery, with subsequent pathologic confirmation of the final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Coexistent DVAs and OVMs were present in 23 (23%) of 102 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine patients had OVMs without DVAs, and in this population, multiple OVMs (from two to 10 or more) were seen in 13 patients (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, multiple OVMs were seen in 10 (43%) of 23 patients with coexisting OVMs and DVAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five (83%) of 30 OVMs coexisting with DVAs were infratentorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 72 patients with surgically resected OVMs, 49 (68%) had pathologically confirmed cavernous malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with coexistent DVAs, seven (46%) had cavernous malformations, four (27%) had thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, and four (27%) had vascular malformations that were not classifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a high prevalence of OVMs with coexistent DVAs, and a high percentage of these were in the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging may increase the probability of finding these lesions, and therefore should be considered part of the preoperative evaluation, since the finding of unexpected coexistent lesions may affect surgical management </plain></SENT>
