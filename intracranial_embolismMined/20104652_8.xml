<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study analyses post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cerebral cortex after cardiogenic embolism in autoptic human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Induction of nestin- and musashi-1-positive cells, potential neural stem/progenitor cells, was observed at the site of ischemic lesions from day 1 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two cell populations were present at distinct locations and displayed different temporal profiles of marker expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no surviving differentiated mature neural cells were observed by 90 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the previously ischemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with recent reports of neurogenesis in the cerebral cortex after induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e>, the present current data indicate the presence of a regional regenerative response in human cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, observations underline the potential importance of supporting survival and differentiation of endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells in post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> human brain </plain></SENT>
