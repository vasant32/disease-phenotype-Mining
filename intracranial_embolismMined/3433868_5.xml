<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients (pts) belonging to at least clinical class III (NYHA) after failed medical therapy (beta-blocking agents and calcium-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>) surgery should be considered (by means of transaortic subvalvular myectomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The history and development of different surgical techniques and procedures has been described in detail since 1958, when Cleland performed the first transaortic subvalvular myotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our surgical series (1963-May 31, 1986) consists of 212 pts (mean age 40 years, range 6-73 years) with typical and atypical HOCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total hospital mortality rate was 6.6% (n = 14), which was reduced to 3.8% (n = 6), if only transaortic subvalvular myectomy (TSM) was performed (n = 160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of 52 pts with additional surgical procedures the mortality rate was 15.4% (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main problems occurred in pts with additional mitral valve replacement (MVR) (n = 15, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of HOCM-related complications (secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp>, total <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV-block</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, intraoperative re-myectomy) and those related to surgery (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, wound dehiscence, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath>) was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore TSM for HOCM is a low-risk surgical procedure with a good long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in pts with a need for additional surgical procedures, the risk is considerably increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjective impression of the pts and hemodynamic data indicate a clear clinical improvement postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concerning long-term survival and reduction of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> rate, our data do not allow a final judgement at the moment </plain></SENT>
