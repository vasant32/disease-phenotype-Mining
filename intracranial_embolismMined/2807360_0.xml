<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were five females and three males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presenting symptoms and signs often simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> or insufficiency, and the diagnosis was confirmed by echocardiography and angiocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient presented with features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> were successfully removed under cardiopulmonary bypass in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, either by shaving them from the atrial septum, or by excising a portion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> atrial septum with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were removed through left atriotomy, while a biatrial approach was utilised for large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was one perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and another patient died one and half years later, probably due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> embolisation in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late functional results have been excellent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two dimensional echocardiography has proved to be extremely accurate in early diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> and in the late follow up of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pertinent literature is reviewed </plain></SENT>
