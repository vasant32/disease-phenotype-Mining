<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after transfemoral aortic valve implantation (TAVI) due to dislodgement and subsequent embolization of debris from aortic arch atheroma or from the calcified valve itself ranges between 2% and 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate of clinically silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is unknown but may be even higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two patients who underwent TAVI with the use of a balloon-expandable (n=22) or self-expandable (n=10) stent valve prosthesis were included in this descriptive study and compared with a historical control group of 21 patients undergoing open surgical aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural apparent and silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was assessed by neurological testing and serial cerebral diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, at 3.4 (2.5 to 4.4) days after the procedure, and at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TAVI was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, new foci of restricted diffusion on cerebral diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were found in 27 of 32 TAVI patients (84%) and were more frequent than after open surgery (10 of 21 patients [48%]; P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These lesions were usually multiple (1 to 19 per patient) and dispersed in both hemispheres in a pattern suggesting cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Volumes of these lesions were significantly smaller after TAVI than after surgery (77 [59 to 94] versus 224 [111 to 338] mm(3); P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were neither measurable impairments of neurocognitive function nor apparent neurological events during the in-hospital period among TAVI patients, but there was 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (5%) in the surgical patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On 3-month follow-up diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, there were no new foci of restricted diffusion, and there was no residual signal change associated with the majority (80%) of the foci detected in the periprocedural period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinically silent new foci of restricted diffusion on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging were detected in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (84%) undergoing TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although typically multiple, these foci were not associated with apparent neurological events or measurable deterioration of neurocognitive function during 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further work needs to be directed to determine the clinical significance of these findings in a larger patient population </plain></SENT>
