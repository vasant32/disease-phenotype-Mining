<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no report on AEICA associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0746101" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bullous lung disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>REPORT: We report a case of AECIA in a 44-year-old female patient combined with asymptomatic pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bulla</z:mp>, and successfully treated by autologous carotid artery reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The possibility of a relationship between AEICA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0746101" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bullous lung disease</z:e> is discussed about the level of alpha 1-antitrypsin (Î±1-AT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The using of external carotid artery (ECA) replace of the internal carotid artery (ICA) combined with resection of the AEICA is an autologous reconstruction to restore arterial continuity and avoiding the use of synthetic or vein graft with their potential complications </plain></SENT>
