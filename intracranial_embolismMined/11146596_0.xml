<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The currently described predictors of CSOE were determined before the availability of trans esophageal echocardiography (TEE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the advent of TEE, many new CSOE were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was planned to investigate if the previously described predictors of CSOE are also valid for patients with CSOE detectable only with TEE (TEE-detected CSOE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 1992-1995, 485 consecutive patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were enrolled in the Maryland <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Data Bank (MSDB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with CSOE identified only by TEE and not by clinical, electrocardiographic or transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) examination were compared to patients with a CSOE with respect to the features of the history, neurologic examination and CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 485 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, 132 (27%) patients had CSOE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 21/132 (16%), diagnosis of high risk CSOE could be established only by TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most discriminating clinical findings in TEE-detected CSOE patients were visual field deficit (OR 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.4) and neglect (OR 3.4; 95% CI,1.2-9.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Less strong associations were also found with other clinical features described previously for CSOE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found for features of the initial CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemineglect</z:e> may suggest a higher likelihood of finding a CSOE by TEE, even if the clinical cardiac examination and TTE are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
