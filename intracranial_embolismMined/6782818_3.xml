<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that these factors play a role for the induction of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 5 microliters air was injected into the right internal carotid artery from a catheter in the external carotid artery after ligation of the extracerebral branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No consistent change in blood pressure was observed with this small amount of air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>Hypercapnia</z:mp>, which increases protein leakage in the brain under conditions of high intraluminal pressure, significantly reduced the extravasation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> and SITS (4 acetamido-4-isothiocyano-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26775">stilbene</z:chebi>-2,2-disulfonic acid disodium), two drugs that effectively reduce the albumin leakage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, had no prophylactic effect in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously hypertensive rats are less vulnerable than normotensive rats to pressure-induced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction but did not significantly differ from controls regarding albumin leakage in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the increased cerebrovascular permeability in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> is not related to hemodynamic factors </plain></SENT>
