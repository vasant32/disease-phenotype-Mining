<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study therefore evaluated in a porcine CPB model the feasibility of bilateral epicarotid Doppler signal recording and the quality of manual or automatic emboli detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 42 recordings (e.g. right carotid artery (n = 20), left carotid artery (n = 22)) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of emboli counts was comparable for both carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Automatic emboli detection, however, found significantly more embolic events per pig than did post-hoc manual off-line analysis of the recordings (172 +/- 217 vs. 13 +/-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the brains, however, showed any emboli or infarction area either in cross-examination or in histological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study showed the feasibility of using an epicarotid Doppler device for bilateral emboli detection in a porcine CPB model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Automatic on-line emboli detection, however, reported more embolic events than did post hoc, off-line manual analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed </plain></SENT>
