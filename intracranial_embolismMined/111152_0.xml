<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the oxygen tension (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi>) at the cerebral cortical surface were obtained by continuous on-line mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Percentage of dry weight and tissue <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> concentrations from ischemic and nonischemic hemispheres were determined at various times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With this preparation, we registered the precise <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cortical surface <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, which showed an exponential downward trend (fast component from 0 to 5 minutes, t 1/2 = 0.8 minute, rate of change = 89% per minute; slow component from 5 to 240 minutes, t 1/2 = 285 minutes, rate of change = 0.3% per minute) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, there was an immediate fall of the cortical surface <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> with reductions of more than 45% at 5 minutes before definite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and electroencephalographic abnormalities were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the secondary phase from 5 to 240 minutes the cortical surface <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> fell by only an additional 23% of the steady state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even so, when cortical surface <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> was maintained at this critically low level, the earliest cerebral cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was evident 180 minutes after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, progressive accumulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> fluid in the cortex (90 to 170.8 microliters per g of tissue) and in the white matter (19 to 46.2 microliter per g of tissue) was detected by the end of 240 minutes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
