<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular events are an important complication during pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during PVAI, and their relationship to microbubble formation and radiofrequency (RF) parameters are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the relationship between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, microbubble detection, and neurological outcome and the impact of RF titration strategy on these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 202 patients in two groups undergoing PVAI using an intracardiac echocardiography (ICE)-guided technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) using insonation of the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of microbubbles on ICE were qualitatively labeled as FEW, MODERATE, and SHOWER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group I (n = 107), RF output was titrated to avoid microbubble formation and in group II (n = 95), standard power-limited RF output was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TCD detected <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 202 patients during PVAI with an average of 1,793 +/- 547 per patient; 90% were detected during left atrial ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over 85% of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> occurred after microbubbles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group I patients had significantly lower numbers of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> (1,015 +/- 438 per patient) compared to group II patients (2,250 +/- 864 per patient) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Group II also had a 3.1% incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological complications versus 0.9% in group I (P = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with clinical events had significantly higher numbers of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between RF power, temperature, or impedence and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> directly correlate to the amount of microbubble formation on ICE, and may result in cerebroembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Titration of RF according to microbubble formation by ICE during PVAI may be important for minimizing the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological complications </plain></SENT>
