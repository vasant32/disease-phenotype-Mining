<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were firstly to determine prevalence, frequency, and clinical significance of cerebral microemboli in an unselected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> population and secondly to examine how this information may improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtype classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We intended to perform transcranial Doppler (TCD) microembolus monitorings of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in the symptomatic hemisphere for 45 min in 120 consecutive patients with internal carotid artery territory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first examination was performed within 72 h from start of symptoms and the second 5 +/- 1 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet and coagulation system activation were measured following TCD monitoring in 38 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were subtyped using the TOAST classification criteria, and the patients' clinical status was assessed at discharge using the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale and the Barthel Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microembolus monitoring was technically possible in 83 (69.2%) of the 120 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two (26.6%) patients had an inadequate temporal bone acoustic window or were too restless to allow long-time monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 5 (4.2%) patients the relevant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (26.5%) of the 83 patients had microemboli despite the fact that over 90% were receiving an antiplatelet or an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean frequency of microemboli was 6.7 +/- 13.6 per 45 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microemboli were more prevalent in assumed cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than in other subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (p = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found no association between the presence of cerebral microemboli and the clinical outcome or the parameters for platelet or coagulation system activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of microemboli was not associated with in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (p = 0.17), whereas <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral microemboli are frequent in unselected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients despite antiplatelet or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TCD detection of microemboli provides valuable pathophysiological information and may, therefore, improve current <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtype classification </plain></SENT>
