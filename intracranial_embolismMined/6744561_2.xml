<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 68 pregnancies (group I) treatment with antiplatelet agents was substituted for that with coumarinics from the first trimester on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group II (128 pregnancies) received coumarinics through the thirty-eighth week of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients in group I died as a result of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of their caged-ball valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was 25.0% in group I and 2.3% in group II patients, while that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> was 10.3% and 28.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">Coumarin</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embryopathy</z:e> was found in 7.9% of group II infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> did not occur in the 12 cases in which subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was substituted for the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> derivative in the first trimester and the last 2 weeks of pregnancy (group III), but maternal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> developed in 8.3% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, uneventful pregnancies and deliveries were observed in 12 of 15 mothers (group IV) with biological prostheses who received no <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that (1) women with cardiac valve prostheses should be counseled against becoming pregnant, (2) antiplatelet agents do not provide protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in these patients, (3) because of the high incidence of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and birth defects use of coumarinics is contraindicated in the first trimester and the last weeks of pregnancy, (4) the substitution of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> at these times may decrease the incidence of these complications, and (5) bioprostheses are indicated in women who wish to bear children </plain></SENT>
