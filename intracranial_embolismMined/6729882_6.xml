<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The surgical specimens from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evacuated spontaneous intracerebral and intracerebellar <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> at the Toronto General Hospital from 1976 to 1981 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases resulting from trauma or from pre-operatively diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> were excluded, leaving 84 cases in which the etiology was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five of the cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo>, while 6 were intracerebellar and 3 were intraventricular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue was received with the blood clot in 54 cases (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From this tissue, an anatomic diagnosis was made in 37 cases; and in 14, the specific etiology of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> could be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The specific etiologic diagnoses were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (7), amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> (6) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 4 other cases, vasculopathy associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was suggested as a possible etiologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of a specific etiologic diagnosis made from specimens in which tissue was included (25%) suggests that biopsy of adjacent brain tissue or preservation of tissue fragments identified at the time of surgery is of diagnostic value </plain></SENT>
