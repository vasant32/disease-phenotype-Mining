<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two methods were employed to generate SPECT images of a brain perfusion study in a 41-year-old patient who had suffered from multiple embolisation of the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Marked improvement in spatial resolution was achieved by CGMM reconstruction as compared to FBP reconstruction; this considerably helped in defining grey matter structures and low-uptake white-matter areas, both in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral areas and in the hemisphere that had been affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the relatively long time still required by the CGMM procedure might be considered as a significant drawback to date, with the increasing diffusion of the new computer facilities the CGMM method can be proposed as a valuable alternative to the standard FBP technique in order to better recognise cerebral areas with different tracer uptake </plain></SENT>
