<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on clinical examination, cerebral computed tomography, Doppler ultrasonography of precerebral arteries and transthoracic echocardiography, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were classified as cardioembolic (n = 38), non-cardioembolic (n = 92), and mixed cardioembolic/hypertensive (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were older than patients with non-cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences in the hemostatic profile are consistent with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> due to activated coagulation being more involved in the pathogenesis of cardioembolic than of non-cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
