<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationships between brain volume and three measures of rodent behavior after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by injecting several thousand microspheres into the internal carotid arteries of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty eight hours later, each subject was rated using a global neurologic rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several weeks later, the subjects were tested for open field activity and visual spatial learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem we measured the volume of the cerebral hemispheres and estimated the volume densities of cortex, white matter, hippocampus, basal ganglia, thalamus, ventricle, and visible infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> caused significant impairment, as measured by the global rating scale; the probability of an abnormal rating was correlated with the number of microspheres trapped in the brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visual spatial learning was significantly impaired by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but this deficit was independent of the count of microspheres, whether the subject was abnormal at 48 h, and whether the left or right hemisphere was embolized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral hemisphere volume was reduced from 430 mm3 to 376 mm3 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cortex was reduced from 22 to 19% of cerebrum (P &lt; 0.05) and the white matter compartment was reduced to similar degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lesion volume was 6% of cerebrum, comparable to that seen with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The global outcome rating was significantly related to total cerebral volume, but not to volume changes in any single compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, visual spatial learning was significantly influenced by volume changes in the cortex and white matter, but not by the topography of the visible infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Open field activity was not altered by infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data suggests that the total volume of brain tissue lost to infarction may partially determine global neurological rating independently of the topography of the volume loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Integrative functions such as learning may depend more on the integrity of specific compartments and less on the total volume of intact brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The volume of visible cystic infarction was not related to long term behavioral outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results should be confirmed using another method of inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
