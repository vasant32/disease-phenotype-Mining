<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The air was detected by X-ray not only in the systemic circulation but also intracranially (in the area of the cisterna magna, cerebral sinuses and intraventricularly) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They draw attention to the fact that even the application of non-conventional ventilation methods does not rule out the development of this serious complication and they recommend, when this complications is suspected, to examine by X-ray also the cranium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the first report in the literature where intracranial embolization developed during HFOV </plain></SENT>
