<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A severe restriction of the visual field was observed in a patient suffering a bilateral occipital lobe infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Soon after the lesion, the visual field had an angle of approx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>4 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some recovery was observed within the following months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the restricted visual field, several visual functions were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increment threshold, for instance, was found to be one log unit higher than would normally be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Color vision was completely lost soon after the lesion, but some recovery was later observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although binocular interaction was demonstrated by the interocular transfer of after-effects, the patient never experienced steropsis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He also seemed unable to recognize faces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dsepite the small visual field, optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> could be elicited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A notable slowing down of visual analyses was observed in experiments on visual reaction time, on the inversion of the Necker cube, and on binocular rivalry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The complete loss of certain functions like steropsis or face recognition in contrast to a quantitative reduction of other functions like visual acuity or color perception can be discussed in the light of two conceptual models of perceptual processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One model suggests the representation of different visual functions within one neuronal network, each function represented by a different number of neurons or a different algorithm within the network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The second model suggests a spatial segregation of different visual functions in different cortical areas that receive input from one common structure, presumably the striate cortex </plain></SENT>
