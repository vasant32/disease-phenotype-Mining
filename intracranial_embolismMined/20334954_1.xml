<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND AREA: An observational prospective study in the Intensive Care Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 16 patients had endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological data, <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> site, time between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and treatment, treatment indication, NIHSS scale at admission and discharge from hospital, complications and functional outcome measured by modified Rankin scale (obtained by telephone survey) were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten male patients with a mean age of 59 years (29-74) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean stay in the ICU was 6 days (1-33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients required mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment indications were: intravenous thrombolysis failure in 4 patients, major vessel occlusion in 5, outside of the therapeutic window in 2, posterior circulation occlusion in 3, outside of the therapeutic window plus major vessel occlusion in 1 and intravenous thrombolysis contraindication in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occlusion site was on posterior circulation in 3 and on carotid territories and branches in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic treatment used was Urokinase at a dose of 100,000-600,000IU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients required mechanical embolectomy and 10 stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization was observed in 11 (69%) and partial in 4 (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three evolved to brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six patients (46%) had a favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale score ≤ 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Technical complication was 1 femoral artery pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With the intra-arterial treatment, high rates of recanalization and favorable outcome are obtained with few complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It could be indicated in patients with severe neurological injury (NIHSS ≥ 10), evolution time between 3-6h, intravenous thrombolysis contraindication and proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
