<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific diagnoses --- <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> as opposed to non-hemorrhagic or hemorrhagic infactions --- were indicated in 97% by spectrophotometry and in 65% by CT scan in 201 of the 231 cases (excluding 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263885" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cerebral tumors</z:e> with cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison between the two methods revealed agreement in most cases, with disagreement in only a few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specific diagnosis was generally established on only one examination by both methods: repeated examinations were necessary in only a few cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that a combination of the two complementary methods established the diagnosis in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was particularly evident if the examinations were performed 24 hours to 21 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease </plain></SENT>
