<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are the problems of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and distribution of the cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe and analyze mortality and cerebral complications in patients undergoing total arch grafting using our refined technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 1994 and March 2002, 100 consecutive patients underwent total arch grafting through median sternotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 49 atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 51 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients were operated on an emergency basis because of rupture or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conducted total arch grafting using hypothermic antegrade cerebral perfusion from every cervical vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carbon dioxide gas was added to the cerebral perfusion in order to inhibit the increase in the cerebral vascular resistance during hypothermic cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were dysarrhythmia (n = 1), mesenteric <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (n = 1), and preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, preoperative shock and concomitant cardiac procedures were risk factors for hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of postoperative neurologic damage was 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Temporary neurologic dysfunction occurred in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, emergency surgery was a risk factor for postoperative neurologic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, there was no significant independent predictor of hospital mortality and neurologic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 96 months was 66.4 +/- 9.1%, and freedom from aortic accidents (reoperation, rupture, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cholesterol embolism</z:e>) was 74.9 +/- 7.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The early- and long-term results of total arch grafting using integrated antegrade cerebral perfusion were found to be satisfactory </plain></SENT>
