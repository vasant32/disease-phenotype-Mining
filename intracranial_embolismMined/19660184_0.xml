<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three common genetic variants within the coagulation cascade were investigated in 500 control subjects and in 167 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> defined by TOAST subclassification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysed variants were factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210G--&gt;A and factor XIII Val34Leu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> was over-represented in patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for trend, whereas the prothrombin 20210G--&gt;A variant and the factor XIII polymorphism Val34Leu were not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of any subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three polymorphisms showed no association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in subgroups of patients defined by age (&lt;40, 40-49, 50-59, &gt; or =60 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This study suggests that the analysis of prothrombin 20210G--&gt;A and factor XIII Val34Leu is not a useful diagnostic procedure in the work-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
