<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The events that follow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> due to cerebral embolization were studied by the analysis of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) function, the degree of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hours after embolization there was no change in the brain water content </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after embolization the brain water content was increased significantly in the ipsilateral, but not in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local CBF further decreased in the ipsilateral hemisphere and a reduction in flow was also observed in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Embolization led to an increase in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability, analysed as regional penetrability of 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and of Evans blue-albumin complexes, which was restricted to the side of the injection of the microspheres </plain></SENT>
