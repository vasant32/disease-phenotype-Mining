<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess for the incidence of clinically silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> after cerebral catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MRI including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-, T2-, and diffusion-weighted images was performed shortly before and after 27 cerebral catheter angiographies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 5/27 angiographies (18.5%) we found 6 new, presumably embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> with a typical diameter of 2-3 mm on diffusion-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the occurrence of these lesions and a preexisting arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, fluoroscopy time, or number of angiographic series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral angiography appears to be associated with a relatively high risk (about 20%) of clinically silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This risk is higher than has been estimated based on the incidence of neurological deficits (0.1-0.3%) after cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The safety of cerebral angiography needs to be improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is suitable to monitor the safety of angiographic procedures and material </plain></SENT>
