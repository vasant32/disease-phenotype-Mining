<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychologic impairment is a common complication of coronary bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral microemboli during cardiopulmonary bypass are the principal cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> after coronary bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> occur during perfusionist interventions (ie, during the injection of air into the venous side of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether an increase in perfusionist interventions is associated with an increased risk of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 83) underwent a battery of neuropsychologic tests preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the median value of perfusionist interventions during cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 1 patients (n = 42) had fewer than 10 perfusionist interventions, and group 2 patients (n = 41) had 10 or more interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 2 groups of patients were similar for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables, with the exception of longer cardiopulmonary bypass times in group 2 patients (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group 2 patients had lower mean scores on 9 of 10 neuropsychologic tests, with 3 (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning, Digit Span, and Visual Span) being statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group 2 patients had worse cognitive test scores, even when controlling for increased bypass times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group 2 patients had a nonsignificant trend toward an increased prevalence of neuropsychologic impairment 3 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of air into the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit by perfusionists, resulting in cerebral microembolization, may contribute to postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
