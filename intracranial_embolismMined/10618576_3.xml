<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous retrospective studies have suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysms</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) are associated with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the embolic potential of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 846 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery from December 1990 to March 1993, we identified 42 patients who had <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> as an incidental finding on intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patency was determined by color and/or contrast echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients were given aspirin postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored by personal and/or telephone interviews, and their clinical conditions were confirmed by their personal physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Any patient with any question of a neurologic event had a detailed neurologic history, examination, and computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in our population was 4.9%; there were 22 men and 20 women with a mean age of 72 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oscillating <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> were present in 28 patients and fixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter of the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was 21 +/- 4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (56%) of 32 patients had a patent <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored for a mean period of 69.5 months (56 to 85 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient had a cerebrovascular event or systemic embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of cerebrovascular events or embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in our patient population with incidental <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If treatment is needed for this condition, aspirin appears to be effective therapy </plain></SENT>
