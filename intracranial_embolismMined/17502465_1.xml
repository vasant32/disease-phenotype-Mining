<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Consecutive patients presenting within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> over 3(3/4) years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient medical history and urinalysis data, including white blood cell count, red blood cell count, specific gravity, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and protein levels at admission, were analyzed and compared with the final determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis (CE vs non-CE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) was performed using a classification and regression tree that included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 urine variables as potential predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional predictors entered into the classification and regression tree model were age, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo> at admission, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 341 individuals met the study criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 68.6 years; 49.8% were female, 70.9% were white, and 38.7% had the CE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In bivariate analysis, age (P = .009), urine white blood cell count (P = .02), urine red blood cell count (P = .005), urine specific gravity (P = .02), and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level (P = .02) were significantly higher in those with the CE vs the non-CE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the classification and regression tree, 58.3% of those with CE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were correctly classified and 84.7% of those with non-CE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were correctly classified, for an overall accuracy of 71.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The best single predictor for the CE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype was a white blood cell count of greater than 14.5/microL, followed by a red blood cell count of greater than 41.7/microL and a serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level greater than 1.08 mg/dL (&gt;95.5 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the distribution in the first 2 divisions in the tree, a patient could be placed into 1 of 4 categories that corresponded to 3 levels of CE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> likelihood: low (25%), moderate (50%), and high (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Urinalysis may have utility in the early identification of the CE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
