<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease of the aorta</z:e> is a known risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after cardiac surgery, but its relationship to NCD is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the relationship between aortic atherosclerotic disease and NCD after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing primary elective CABG were enrolled in an ongoing investigation of NCD after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) of the thoracic aorta was performed and analyzed off-line to quantify atheroma burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitive evaluation was performed, both preoperatively and at 6 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable linear regression (controlling for age, years of education, and base line cognitive index) was used to determine the relationship between NCD and atheroma burden in the ascending, arch, and descending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two patients who had a complete neurocognitive evaluation and adequate TEE images were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship was found between NCD and atheroma burden in the ascending (p = 0.22), arch (p = 0.89) or descending aorta (p = 0.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the etiology of NCD is likely multifactorial, our results suggest that aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may not be the primary factor in the pathogenesis of post-CABG <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
