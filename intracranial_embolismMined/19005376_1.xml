<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) remains the primary modality of treating individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and significant comorbidities or anatomically difficult lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of embolization protection devices (EPD) has been mandated by the cerebrovascular community even though the ability of these devices to prevent symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> is not supported by the current literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to assess the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients who underwent CAS without EPDs at our hospital from 1996 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent CAS without EPDs at the Jefferson Hospital for Neuroscience in Philadelphia, PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical and angiographic outcomes of these patients were studied retrospectively using chart reviews and operative, angiographic, and radiological reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean clinical and radiological follow-up period was 18.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred five patients (97.2%) had clinical follow-up at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During this period, the following complications were observed: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> in 2 patients (1.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> in 2 patients (1.9%), femoral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in 1 patient (0.9%), retroperitoneal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> in 3 patients (2.8%), and cervical carotid dissections in 4 patients (3.7%); 2 patients (1.9%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six patients (80.9%) had a mean clinical follow-up period of 18.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During this period, 2 patients (2.6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo>, 1 of which was fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The long-term morbidity and mortality rate was 2.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the same follow-up period, the restenosis (&gt;50% stenosis from baseline) rate was 9.2% (7 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three (3.9%) of these patients went on to require repeat CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our experience reveals that CAS can be performed safely with risks similar to those reported in series in which EPDs were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Any procedure or device that adds risk and cost to the patient should be evaluated with a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate its efficacy, especially in situations in which published data provide conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The use of EPDs should be no exception to this paradigm </plain></SENT>
