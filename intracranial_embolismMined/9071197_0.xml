<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in 9 of 10 surviving patients at one month, mean time after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, by 123[<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) SPECT </plain></SENT>
