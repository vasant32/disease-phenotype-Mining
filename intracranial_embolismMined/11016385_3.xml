<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of cerebral microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and conventional (conv.) mitral valve operations and to determine the association of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> with various stages of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intraoperative computer-aided transcranial Doppler measurements were performed to detect cerebral microemboli in 21 patients undergoing MIS and in 14 patients undergoing conv. mitral valve operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated the mean embolic rate for three time periods: P1, start of the operation until aortic clamping; P2, aortic clamping until clamp removal; and P3, declamping until end of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the total number of detected cerebral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> between both patient groups (MIS 1,014+/-753, conv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>937+/-519; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the highest number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected during the third time period when the heart regained effective ejection (MIS 875+/-746, conv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>680+/-462; p &gt; 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial Doppler was useful to detect cerebral microemboli in MIS and conv. mitral valve operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found no increased risk of cerebral microembolism during the minimally invasive method compared with the conventional technique </plain></SENT>
