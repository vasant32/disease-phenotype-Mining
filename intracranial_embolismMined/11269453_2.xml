<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important cause of embolism is aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Constructing both distal and proximal anastomoses during a single period of aortic cross-clamping avoids this source of embolism and may reduce neurologic injury after coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were prospectively randomized to group 1, in which a single aortic cross-clamping was used to construct distal and proximal anastomoses, or to group 2, in which the proximal anastomoses were each constructed with a partial occluding aortic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of S-100 and troponin-T release were measured preoperatively and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aortic cross-clamp time was significantly longer in group 1, but other preoperative and intraoperative variables were equally represented in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control group levels of S-100 and troponin-T were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative S-100 levels were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 (p &lt; 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between the groups in postoperative troponin-T levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial suggest improved cerebral protection is associated with the single aortic cross-clamp technique for coronary artery bypass grafting with no increase in myocardial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The single aortic cross-clamp technique is simple and inexpensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend its wider use </plain></SENT>
