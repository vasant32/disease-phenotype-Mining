<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine whether naftidrofuryl oxalate (naftidrofuryl), a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>, is capable of improving brain regional blood flow of animals in sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral ischaemia</z:e> was induced by injecting 900 microspheres (48 microns in diameter) into the right internal carotid artery of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow of brain regions was measured by a hydrogen clearance method on the 3rd, 7th and 28th days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic animals were treated with naftidrofuryl, 15 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p., from the first to 28th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microsphere-embolism caused a sustained decrease in cortical and striatal blood flow over a period of 28 days, whereas hippocampal blood flow was decreased on the 3rd day but not on the 7th or 28th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the 3rd day, the striatal and hippocampal but not cortical blood flow of naftidrofuryl-treated, microsphere-embolized rats was higher than untreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the 7th and 28th days, the cortical and striatal blood flow of the treated and untreated animals did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain slices from microsphere-embolized rats contained areas, which were not stained with triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC), to a similar degree on the 3rd, 7th and 28th days, indicating the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TTC-unstained areas of microsphere-embolized rats that had received naftidrofuryl treatment were smaller than those of untreated rats on the 3rd and 7th days, but not on the 28th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that naftidrofuryl improves cerebral circulation impaired by microsphere-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and this higher level of cerebral blood flow of the treated animal may account for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>delayed development</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
