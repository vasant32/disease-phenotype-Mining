<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mortality in this group is 2 times higher than in general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, if the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> co-exists with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e>, the risk of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> is growing up 17 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the many European medical centers, intraoperative ablation is the obligatory procedure performed during mitral valve replacement/mitral valvuloplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of that procedure (in experienced centers) are evaluated on 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It reduces significantly the cost of the farther pharmacological treatment and improves the quality of life of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our Clinic ablation is performed in patients qualified to the mitral valve replacement or mitral valvuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures are performed in extracorporeal circulation, in general and local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, with using crystal cardioplegine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Before the clumping of the aorta, on the beating heart ablation in the right atrium is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After that, the aorta is being clumped and the heart is being stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The left cardiac auricle is being cut off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Then the ablation around the ostia of the pulmonary veins is being done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After that, mitral valve replacement or mitral valvuloplasty procedure is being performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Changes in the heart wall are transmural through the full wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>From the December 2001 till today 4 ablation procedures were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Units Cobra (Boston Scientific) and Cardioblate Surgical Ablation System (Medtronic) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Both units are based on the unipolar energy with frequency similar to the radio-waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>After this procedure, regular rhythm came back in our 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Advantages of the intraoperative ablation are: simultaneous procedure with open heart operation, reduction of the price of the treatment, minimal risk of complication </plain></SENT>
