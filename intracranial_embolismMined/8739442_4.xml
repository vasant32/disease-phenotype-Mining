<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>188 patients had a potential cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular echocardiography was diagnostic in 163 patients, and Holter-electrocardiography 10; 159 of these 188 patients (84.6%) had competitive etiologies, predominantly large vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 136 patients cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> was assumed as quite definite or possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify these patients reliably, transthoracal and transesophageal echocardiography would have been necessary in 89% of the entire group of patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with clinically cardiological abnormalities, pathological routine ECG, without vascular risk factors, or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in duplex sonography), and Holter-electrocardiography in 54% </plain></SENT>
