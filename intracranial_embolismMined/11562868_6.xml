<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the deleterious effect of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animal models suggest a link between both families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate possible relations between the MMP overproduction and proinflammatory cytokine expression after human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients attended during a 10 months period, we selected and prospectively studied those presenting as a cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> involving the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MMP 9, MMP 2 and IL 6 were serially measured by means of ELISA at study entry and at 12, 24 and 48 hours after symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 39 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between mean expression of both MMPs and IL 6 (r= 0.33, p= 0.040 for MMP 2 y r= 0.45, p= 0.004 for MMP 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measured timepoints, the best obtained correlation was that of MMP 9 with IL 6 at 24 hours (r= 0.418, p= 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 24 h a peak value of IL 6 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Baseline MMP 2 and MMP 9 levels showed a trend to correlate with that peak of IL 6 (r= 0.329, p= 0.061 for MMP 2 y r= 0.325, p= 0.061 for MMP 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MMP expression correlates with the inflammatory cascade activation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
