<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The case-fatality rates and long-term prognosis of the patients were strongly affected by age, and the number of patients requiring permanent hospital care rose sharply with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The case-fatality rates in the different age groups were as follows: under 50 years 6%, 50-64 years 16%, 65-74 years 32%, 75-84 years 48% and over 85 years 66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative survival rates at 1 and 5 years were as follows: under 50 years 54 and 46%, 50-64 years and 38%, 65-74 years 60 and 20% and over 75 years 45 and 10% </plain></SENT>
