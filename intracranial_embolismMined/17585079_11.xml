<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that patients with frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial premature beats</z:e> (APBs) recorded in 24-hour ECG will show more often <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> when followed by repeated long-term ECG recordings than patients without or infrequent APBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 127 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and without known AF were enrolled in a prospective study to detect paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified according to the number of APBs recorded in a 24-hour ECG (&gt; or =70 APBs versus &lt;70 APBs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent serial 7-day event-recorder monitoring at 0, 3, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serial extended ECG monitoring identified AF in 26% of patients with frequent APBs but only in 6.5% when APBs were infrequent (P=0.0021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis showed that the presence of frequent APBs in the initial 24-hour ECG was the only independent predictor of paroxysmal AF during follow-up (odds ratio 6.6, 95% confidence intervals 1.6 to 28.2, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, frequent APBs (&gt; or = 70/24 hours) are a marker for individuals who are at greater risk to develop or have paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For such patients, we propose a diagnostic workup with repeated prolonged ECG monitoring to diagnose paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
