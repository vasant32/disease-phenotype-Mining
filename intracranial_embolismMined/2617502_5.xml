<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report describes a series of 20 patients operated on for a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (16) were benign <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp>; 12 of them were located in the left atrium, two in the right atrium and two were biatrial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipomas</z:hpo> were found; one was epicardial and the other was located in the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only intraventricular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> was a malignant left ventricular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027095" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">myosarcoma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The propensity of intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> to embolize was distinctive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 16 <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> presented with peripheral embolization, and in two patients surgery was complicated by fatal perioperative cerebral embolization of myxomatous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in one patient embolization of a left atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipoma</z:hpo> necessitated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> of her left arm before cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late postoperative recurrences were found in two patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one of them, reoperation showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> had grown at that site in the interatrial septum where the original pedicle had been excised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo> and underwent replacement with a prosthetic valve at reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Otherwise our late follow-up study showed that the results of surgery were usually excellent even though mild echocardiographic abnormalities were not uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our experience emphasizes the embolic potential of intracardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> and suggests, furthermore, that to avoid recurrences excisions with wide margins should be preferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography is an optimal method for the follow-up of these patients </plain></SENT>
