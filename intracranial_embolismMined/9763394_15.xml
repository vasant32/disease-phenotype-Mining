<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients with symptomatic basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were treated with intraarterial urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiograms at the time of treatment were analyzed to characterize collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) and the degree of collateral filling of the basilar artery were then compared with symptom duration before treatment, with Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score at the time of treatment, with 90-day modified Rankin score, and with 90-day survival status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 20 patients who had carotid artery injections at the time of the thrombolytic procedure, two had no PCoA, eight had one PCoA, and 10 had two PCoAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine had no collateral opacification of the basilar artery, six had collateral opacification of the distal basilar artery, and five had collateral opacification of the distal and proximal basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-day survival was 38%; 25% of patients had good neurologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the number of PCoAs and symptom duration, pretreatment GCS score, survival, or neurologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Duration of symptoms before treatment was longer in patients with collateral flow to the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery collateral flow did not correlate with survival, but it did correlate with neurologic outcome for the 12 patients with middle or distal basilar artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in whom collateral flow to the basilar artery was assessed (83% with collateral flow had good neurologic outcomes, but only 17% without collateral flow had good outcomes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients with proximal basilar artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in whom collateral flow was assessed died, independent of the collateral flow observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, neurologic outcome was better after intraarterial thrombolysis in patients who had collateral filling of the basilar artery, except in cases of proximal basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with collateral filling of the basilar artery also tolerated longer symptom duration </plain></SENT>
