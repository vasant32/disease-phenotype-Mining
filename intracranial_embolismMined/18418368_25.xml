<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were subjected to embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and treated daily with saline (n=10) or with sildenafil (n=11) initiated at 24 h and subsequently for 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T(2)(*)-weighted imaging, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements were performed from 24 h to 6 weeks after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T(2)(*) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and axonal remodeling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, respectively, starting from 1 week in sildenafil-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Areas demarcated by MRI with <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp>, elevated local CBF, and augmented axonal remodeling were spatially and temporally matched, and FA values were significantly correlated with the corresponding CBF values (R=0.66, P&lt;4 x 10(-5)) at 6 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Axonal projections were reorganized along the ischemic boundary after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These MRI measurements, confirmed by histology, showed that sildenafil treatment simultaneously <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> and axonal remodeling, which were MRI detectable starting from 1 week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spatial and temporal consistency of MRI metrics and the correlation between FA and local CBF suggest that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, by elevating local CBF, promotes axonal remodeling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
