<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed the nuclear resonance NR images in three patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tomodensitometric findings are not reliable in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and cerebral angiography is required for the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of NR for the investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235522" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous disease</z:e> has been recently demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients in whom a diagnosis of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was made with NR have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially, the vacuum signal in the T1 enhanced sequences disappears and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> becomes hypointense in the T2 enhanced sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the following phase, proton relaxation is impaired by methemoglobin production and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> appears as hyperintense in both the T1 and T2 enhanced sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the resolution phase, the vacuum signal in the vascular lumen reappears and the hyperintensity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> signal becomes attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our study we have shown the different stages of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> with NR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have demonstrated the close relation between these images and the clinical evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NR is a useful noninvasive investigation in patients with suspected intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
