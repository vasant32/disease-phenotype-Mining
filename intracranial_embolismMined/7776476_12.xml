<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed with continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring provides a unique opportunity to determine the number of cerebral microemboli and to relate their occurrence to the surgical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess in CEA the impact of cerebral microembolism on clinical outcome and brain architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the influence of the audible transcranial Doppler signal on the surgeon and his or her technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective series of 301 patients, CEA was monitored with electroencephalography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and intraoperative risk factors were entered in a logistic regression analysis program to assess their correlation with cerebral outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the impact of cerebral microembolism on brain architecture, we compared preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance images of the brain in two subgroups of 58 and 40 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven (2.3%) patients had intraoperative transient ischemic symptoms, three (1%) had intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 1 (0.3%) had transient ischemic symptoms after operation, and 10 (3.3%) had postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four (1.3%) patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microemboli (&gt; 10) noticed during dissection were related to both intraoperative (p &lt; 0.002) and postoperative (p &lt; 0.02) cerebral complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microemboli that occurred during shunting were also related to intraoperative complications (p &lt; 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microembolism never resulted in new morphologic changes on postoperative computed tomography scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the phenomenon of more than 10 microemboli during dissection was significantly (p &lt; 0.005) related to new hyperintense lesions on postoperative T2-weighted magnetic resonance images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During CEA the presence of microembolism (&gt; 10 microemboli) during dissection shows a statistically significant relationship with perioperative cerebral complications and with new ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance images of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, microembolism during shunting is also related to intraoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Surgeons can be guided by the audio Doppler and emboli signals by changing their technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This change may result in a decrease of microembolism and consequently in a decline of the intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
