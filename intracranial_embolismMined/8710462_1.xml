<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate brain CT and MRI findings in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome (FES), we retrospectively analyzed images from 5 patients with FES during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain CT examinations demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in 2 patients and transient spotty low density lesions in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed no abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI, however, showed brain abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were revealed as spotty high signal intensity lesions on T2WI, and some showed low intensity on T1WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These spotty lesions were considered to reflect edematous fluid occurring as a result of the unique pathophysiological condition of FES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the spotty high signal intensity lesions on T2WI were distributed in the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, thalamus, basal ganglia, internal capsule and corpus callosum, cerebral and cerebellar spotty lesions were characteristically located along the boundary zones of the major vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This characteristic location might be induced by a hypoxic brain condition in FES because the numerous fat globules present in this condition can block entire brain capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This characteristic signal location on T2WI is a useful indicator for differentiating FES from the primary intra-axial brain injury in patients with multifocal trauma </plain></SENT>
