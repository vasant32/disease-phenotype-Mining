<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their clinical correlates are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess their relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and to determine whether the severity of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> has an impact on their occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 96 arteries in 75 consecutive patients with extracranial or intracranial arterial lesions or potential cardiac sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients had histories of cerebral or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and 15 were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was based on the clinical presentation and was supported by extensive laboratory testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A transcranial Doppler sonography unit equipped with special software for emboli detection was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Signals were selected based on criteria established a priori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Signals were detected in the territories of 28.3% of symptomatic and 11.6% of asymptomatic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference was significant (P = .045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When patients with suspected cardiac embolic sources were excluded, the difference between symptomatic (27.9%) and asymptomatic (2.9%) arteries remained significant (P = .003), and signals were more frequent distal to arteries with more than 50% area stenosis (23.5%) than arteries with stenoses equal to or less than 50% (3.7%) (P = .028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with only extracranial internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e>, the difference between these degrees of stenosis remained significant (P = .043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that high-intensity transient signals are significantly more common in the territories of symptomatic arteries and distal to lesions causing more than 50% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings may have diagnostic and therapeutic applications </plain></SENT>
