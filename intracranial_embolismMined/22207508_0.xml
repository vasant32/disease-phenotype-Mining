<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Considering that insufficient platelet inhibition is related to thrombotic complications after coronary angiography, we hypothesized that the extent of platelet inhibition by antiplatelet agents is related to the occurrence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262004" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic cerebral infarction</z:e> (SECI) after coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among the patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery, we retrospectively analyzed the location of SECI on diffusion-weighted imaging of 272 patients, which was performed after coronary angiography, as a presurgical evaluation in Phase 1 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Phase 2 study, we have prospectively recruited 102 patients to compare the extent of platelet inhibition measured by the VerifyNow system among patients with and without SECI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SECI is observed in 45 patients (16.5%) in Phase 1 and 17 (16.7%) in Phase 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesions were slightly more frequent in the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Phase 2 study, aspirin reaction units and P(2)Y(12) reaction units were higher in the patients with SECI than those without (aspirin reaction units: 490±72 versus 446±53, P=0.03; P(2)Y(12) reaction units: 352±65 versus 300±77, P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of SECI increased with the number of resistant antiplatelets; resistance to both antiplatelet agent (50%), resistance to 1 antiplatelet agent (22%), and no resistance (4%; P=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the result of logistic regression, higher aspirin reaction units, white blood cell count, low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and nonresponsiveness to antiplatelet agents were independent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient platelet inhibition after administration of antiplatelet agents is related with SECI appearing after coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
