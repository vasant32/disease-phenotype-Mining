<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) has been used to detect microembolic signals in a variety of clinical situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of TCD-detected microemboli in 38 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were stratified into high-risk (group 1), medium-risk (group 2), and low-risk (group 3) groups based on their risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microemboli were detected in 11% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were present in 17% of group 1, 10% of group 2, and 0% of group 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emboli were present in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (&gt; 70%), and mitral valve strands with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with microemboli more frequently had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> compared with patients without microemboli (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also more frequently had recent (&lt; 3 months) symptoms compared with patients without microemboli (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with a cardiac source of embolization, the number of microemboli detected was directly proportional to the acuity of previous symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that TCD-detected microemboli are associated with an increased prevalence of prior cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of TCD-detected microemboli could be a risk factor for cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
