<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the first postoperative month, six patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, one was reoperated because of leakage caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> on the valve, and five others suffered six thromboembolic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-six late thromboembolic complications occurred in 40 of the 216 patients who survived the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven died, four from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and three from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The late incidence was 7 episodes per 100 patients per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Valves of series 1200 carried a significantly higher risk of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> than did those of series 2300, and most episodes occurred in patients with cell controlled <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence was not influenced by time since operation, continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e>, heart size, or the degree of intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that arterial thromboembolic complications represent a major threat to patients with aortic ball valves even several years after operation and in spite of intense <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
