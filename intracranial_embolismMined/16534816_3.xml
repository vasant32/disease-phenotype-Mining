<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that carotid artery angioplasty and stenting may offer a viable alternative for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, especially in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a prospective single-center registry designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of carotid artery angioplasty and stenting with and without distal protection devices in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 116 consecutive patients underwent 126 procedures and 127 stents were deployed successfully in 130 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (63%) had restenosis after a prior carotid endarterectomy; 31% were considered to be ineligible for carotid endarterectomy by both the vascular surgeons and the interventional cardiologist and 9% were considered ineligible for surgery due to hostile neck <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural and follow-up evaluation included a thorough independent clinical and neurological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distal embolic protection devices were used in 44% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedural success was achieved in 122 procedures (97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of in-hospital major adverse cerebrovascular events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>) was 2.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Event rates in patients with prior carotid endarterectomy were comparable to patients with de novo lesions with 5.2% vs. 2.4% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 30 days and 8.3% and 6.6% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates at 1 year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When distal protection devices were used, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were 0% as compared to 4.5% when distal protection was not used (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, minor embolic phenomena were observed in both primary and secondary lesions independent of the use of distal protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results support the use of carotid artery angioplasty and stenting in high-risk patients with significant primary or secondary carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In both types of lesions, acceptable results justify its use as a valid revascularization method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While clinical embolic events occur in a minority of patients in both lesion types, they are not entirely prevented by distal protection </plain></SENT>
