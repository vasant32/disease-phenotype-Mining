<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cortical vein occlusion was attained by using the photochemical thrombotic technique, and the sequential LCBF was measured by using a laser Doppler flowmeter positioned over the middle frontal cortex between two adjacent dorsal veins for 120 minutes after the start of the irradiation to the cortical vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were assigned to one of three experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Group A (n = 10), one dorsal cerebral vein was occluded; in Group B (n = 10), two adjacent dorsal cerebral veins were occluded; and in a sham-operated group (n = 5), the rats also underwent craniotomy and light exposure but received injections of saline rather than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours, the rats were submitted to perfusion fixation and were examined histopathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After irradiation-induced cortical vein occlusion, a gradual and significant decrease of the LCBF was observed in both Group A (significantly different from the LCBF of the sham-operated group after 90 min, P &lt; 0.05, and 120 min, P &lt; 0.01) and Group B (significantly different from the LCBF of the sham-operated group at 30 min, P &lt; 0.05, and at 60, 90, and 120 min, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences (P &lt; 0.01) in the LCBF were also seen between the two experimental groups at 90 and 120 minutes after the start of the irradiation and the subsequent brain damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
