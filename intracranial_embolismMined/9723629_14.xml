<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fixed minidose <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> is effective in preventing venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> with low risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and no need for frequent clinical monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients &gt; 60 years with nonrheumatic AF were randomized in an open-labeled trial to receive fixed minidose <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (1.25 mg/day) or standard adjusted-dose <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (International Normalized Ratio [INR] between 2.0 and 3.0) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study was discontinued before completion in light of publication of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Prevention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> III trial, which indicated that low-intensity fixed-dose <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment (i.e., INR &lt; 1.5) was insufficient for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in high-risk patients with nonrheumatic AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From a total of 1,209 considered patients, 303 were randomized to be studied (150 in the minidose group and 153 in the adjusted-dose group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 14.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of cumulative primary events was 11.1% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 4.0 to 18.2) in the fixed minidose group and 6.1% (95% CI 1.1 to 11.1) in the adjusted-dose group (p = 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the minidose group (3.7% vs 0% per year, p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in primary outcome events was observed in the abbreviated study </plain></SENT>
