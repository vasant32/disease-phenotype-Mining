<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many previous studies have endeavored to find appropriate means to reduce the occurrence of neurologic manifestations in patients with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated patients with IE-associated neurologic complications and compared them with patients with IE who did not have neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Particular attention was focused on assessing the impact of cardiac surgery and the presence of potential risk factors for complications on the outcome of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 218 episodes designated as definite or possible IE according to Duke criteria and treated during the years 1980 through 1996 in a Finnish teaching hospital were retrospectively evaluated for neurologic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurologic complications were identified in 55 episodes (25%), with an embolic event as the most frequent manifestation (23/55; 42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the majority (76%) of episodes, the neurologic manifestation was evident before antimicrobial treatment was started, being the first sign of IE in 47% of episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 1 recurrent cerebral embolization was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications were significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318973" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Staphylococcus aureus infection</z:e> (29% vs 10%; P =.001) and with IE affecting both the aortic and the mitral valves (56% vs 23%; P&lt;.01), but not with echocardiographic detection of vegetations or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of IE occurred in 13 episodes (24%) with neurologic complications and in 17 episodes (10%) without neurologic complications (P&lt;.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In episodes with neurologic complications, the IE-associated mortality rate was 25% (10/40) in the medical treatment group and 20% (3/15) in the surgical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> was observed in these surgically treated patients postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results reinforce the belief that rapid diagnosis and initiation of antimicrobial therapy may still be the most effective means to prevent neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data underscore the importance of diagnostic alertness to the prognosis of patients with IE </plain></SENT>
