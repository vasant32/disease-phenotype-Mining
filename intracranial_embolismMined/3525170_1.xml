<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In pigs a low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> could be induced which closely simulated streptococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in man, but for technical reasons this model proved unsatisfactory for further experimentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In dogs the induction of S. sanguis <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> produced a more severe illness with a short natural history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dogs were divided into two groups, one treated with <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> alone, the other with <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> and streptokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A five-day course, in which twice daily injections of an acylated streptokinase-plasminogen complex were given, caused a substantial reduction in the size of vegetations and possibly a higher proportion of cures and less damage to the valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infarction of the brain, almost certainly due to embolism, was significantly greater in the streptokinase treated group, but the same was not true of the kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possible value of such treatment for certain kinds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> in man, especially in the right side of the heart, is discussed </plain></SENT>
