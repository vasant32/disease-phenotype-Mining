<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficiency of 2 distal filtration devices designed for cerebral protection during carotid angioplasty in an in-vitro bench-top model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After positioning the respective protection devices (RX Accunet and DynaCap) 5 cm distal to the bifurcation, embolization from carotid angioplasty was simulated by injecting polyvinyl alcohol particles in groups of small (150 to 250-microm diameter, approximately 500 particles), medium (250 to 355-microm diameter, approximately 200 particles), and large (700 to 1000-microm diameter, approximately 80 particles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five milligrams of each group were injected separately into the internal carotid artery (ICA) model proximal to the protection filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Particles passing the protection devices were caught in 100-microm filters and weighed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For small particles, the amount in the effluent of the ICA was 0.34+/-0.12 mg (6.8%) for the RX Accunet and 0.51+/-0.16 mg (11.2%) for the Occam DynaCap (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the other particle sizes, there was no statistical difference between the filters (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> test runs, neither of the tested devices prevented embolization completely, with approximately 3% to 6% of particles penetrating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For small particles, the lowest amount of particles passing the protection device was achieved using the RX Accunet system </plain></SENT>
