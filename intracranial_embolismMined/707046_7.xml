<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pial arteries of the right cerebral hemisphere were stained blue, particularly the middle cerebral artery and its main arterial branchlets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, some endothelial cells in the right middle cerebral artery, small arteries and arterioles showed a diffuse distribution of horseradish peroxidase in their cytoplasm, although these vessels only occasionally showed peroxidase in their basement membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other endothelial cells in these arterial branchlets showed few if any signs of a diffuse distribution of peroxidase but displayed several pinocytotic vesicles and occasionally trans-endothelial channels filled with peroxidase, sometimes with a slight leakage of peroxidase into adjacent basement membranes and neuropil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scattered pinocytotic vesicles were observed in capillaries and venules, but there was usually no extravasation of peroxidase around these vessels </plain></SENT>
