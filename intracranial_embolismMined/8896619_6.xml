<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed findings in 18 patients with occlusion of a major artery in respect to cerebral blood flow thresholds for infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of these patients had shown complete recanalization just after the treatment, between 3.5 and 7.25 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and the other nine had shown no change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured by single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT using 99mTC-labeled hemamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> and assessed semiquantitatively: multiple regions of interest were placed on the section images and two parameters, the R/CL ratio and the R/CE ratio, were calculated (where R represents a mean count of the region of interest in the affected hemisphere, CL on the opposite side, and CE in the cerebellar hemisphere on the affected ischemic side) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reperfusion significantly reduced the development of infarction in the regions of interest with an R/CL ratio between 0.65 and 0.85 or an R/CE ratio between 0.55 and 0.75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between the development of infarction and the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow threshold in patients without recanalization was higher than that in patients with recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reperfusion achieved by fibrinolytic therapy in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage can save ischemic brain within a limited cerebral blood flow value </plain></SENT>
