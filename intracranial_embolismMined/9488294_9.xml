<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The present study was conducted to estimate the frequency and timing of rebleeding after initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) from ruptured giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed records of 109 patients who suffered an initial SAH from a giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and were treated at the Mayo Clinic between 1973 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They represented 25% of patients with giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> seen at this institution during that 23-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven of the patients were residents of Rochester, Minnesota, and the rest were referred from other institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> ranged from 25 to 60 mm in diameter, and 74% were located on arteries of the anterior intracranial circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative frequency of rebleeding at 14 days after admission was 18.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid drainage, cerebral angiography, and delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> recurrence were implicated in rebleeding in some of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding was not precluded by intraaneurysm <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those who suffered recurrent SAH at the Mayo Clinic, 33% died in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rebleeding from giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> occurs at a rate comparable to that associated with smaller <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, a finding that should be considered in management strategies </plain></SENT>
