<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI) are thought to be of embolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in several patients with multiple ischemic lesions on DWI-MRI, no embolic source was detected, despite a thorough clinical work-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> etiology in such cases is then classified as cryptogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In other patients, a potential embolic source is limited to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) that may act as an embolic source of unsure relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the prevalence of the multiple-lesion pattern in patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened 650 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients by DWI-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the subsequent evaluation, we excluded patients with a cardiac embolic source other than <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, and other apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> causes, such as dissection or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and patients whose diagnostic work-up was incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the remaining 106 patients, we found DWI lesions in 73, who were subjected to further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in the occurrence of the multiple-lesion pattern in patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, either for the entire group or for the subgroup of young <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who were &lt;50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> showed a significantly higher incidence of multiple lesions in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The multiple-lesion pattern on DWI-MRI is not uncommon, even when extensive testing does not reveal any embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is not possible to discriminate between cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from an assumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
