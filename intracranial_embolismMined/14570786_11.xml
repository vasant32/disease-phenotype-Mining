<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to determine the relationship between cerebral microemboli and aortic atheroma burden in patients undergoing cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transoesophageal echocardiographic images of the ascending, arch and descending aorta were evaluated in 128 patients to determine the aortic atheroma burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) of the right middle cerebral artery was performed in order to measure cerebral embolic load during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate linear regression, the numbers of emboli were compared with the atheroma burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for age, cardiopulmonary bypass time and the number of bypass grafts, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> were significantly associated with atheroma in the ascending aorta (R2=0.11, P=0.02) and aortic arch (P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no association between emboli and descending aortic atheroma burden (R2=0.05, P=0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a positive relationship between TCD-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and the atheromatous burden of the ascending aorta and aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previously demonstrated associations between TCD-detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> and adverse cerebral outcome may be related to the presence of significant aortic atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
