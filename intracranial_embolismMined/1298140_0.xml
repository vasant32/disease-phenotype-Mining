<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most important applications of TCD in the ICU are the diagnosis and monitoring of vasospasms caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> after rupture of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further indications are the non invasive diagnosis of critical decreases of cerebral perfusion pressure, the evaluation of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the monitoring of thrombolysis of occlusions of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD lends itself as a valuable non invasive bedside-monitoring tool, which enables continuous or intermittent monitoring of intracerebral hemodynamics without strain for the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disadvantages to be mentioned are the dependence of experienced examiners and the long lasting training phase required to achieve the requisite experience </plain></SENT>
