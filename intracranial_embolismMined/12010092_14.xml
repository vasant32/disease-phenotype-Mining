<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the Parodi anti-embolism system (PAES) in establishing flow reversal in the internal carotid artery (ICA) as a means of protecting against embolic phenomena during carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven centers participated in a nonrandomized, prospective trial of carotid angioplasty and stenting under PAES protection in 30 patients (22 men; mean age 72 years, range 49-88) with 15 symptomatic (&gt;70%) and 15 asymptomatic (&gt;80%) stenotic ICAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Safety was defined as achieving sufficient brain oxygenation during flow reversal as determined by level of awareness and motor control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of new or enhanced neurological deficits and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Performance was based on angiographic evidence of successful retrograde flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PAES was positioned in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 patients, but technical error and access-related difficulties prevented establishment of reversed flow in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 28 (93%) patients treated under PAES protection, 1 patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> after flow reversal, necessitating balloon deflation between subsequent stages of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three other adverse events included 1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> in one and temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> events resolved with appropriate therapy, and there was no change from baseline in the neurological status or brain scans at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or neurological deficits at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PAES appears to be a safe and effective means of providing protection from embolic complications during carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
