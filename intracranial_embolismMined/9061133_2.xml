<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether continuous transcranial Doppler (TCD) can significantly alter therapeutic conduct during carotid endarterectomy, a retrospective study of 117 carotid endarterectomies was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no perioperative mortality; one perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was recorded in a patient who was symptomatic preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continuous TCD of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was attempted in 99 cases, and successful in 90; nine patients (9.1%) had inadequate temporal windows for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocities and emboli were recorded before and during carotid cross-clamping, and on clamp release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant velocity differences between the patients with regional and general anesthesia, and patients with and without carotid shunts, but there was a statistically significant difference in the total number of emboli (air and particulate transients) noted for the shunted and nonshunted patients after clamp release: 12.7 versus 23.6, respectively (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference when particulate and air microemboli were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During surgery TCD identified residual flow of less than 40% in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in 17 patients (18.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCD also identified hyperperfusion in two patients, shunt abnormalities in three patients, and influenced postop treatment in four patients, one of whom was returned to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TCD is an important tool for identifying patients who would benefit from a shunt, preventing hyperperfusion, identifying postop emboli, and detecting technical errors </plain></SENT>
