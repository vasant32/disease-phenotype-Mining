<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Refinements of treatment methods are sought to rapidly reduce the volume of intracranial clots and to decrease patient exposure to possible complications of thrombolytic therapy for intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the possibility of adding ultrasonication using model systems including human blood clots and temporal bone in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The transmittance of ultrasound through temporal bone obtained at autopsy was compared between the frequencies 211.5 KHz and 1.03 MHz, using a meter to determine the power delivered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency 211.5 KHz was chosen to assess the ultrasound effect on the weight of 24-hour-old clots prepared from human blood after exposures at 37 degrees C to 2 mg/ml urokinase with no additional treatment, ultrasound, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> during an interval of up to 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At these times, fibrin degradation products also were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The transmittance of low-frequency ultrasound (211.5 KHz) through temporal bone was approximately 40%, which is four times higher than that of high-frequency ultrasound (1.03 MHz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> significantly increased clot lysis (140% of lysis with urokinase alone), with correspondingly increased fibrin degradation products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that low-frequency ultrasound transmits well through human temporal bone and enhances thrombolysis in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinically, this method may be promising for reducing dosages of thrombolytic agents and shortening the period of clot removal </plain></SENT>
