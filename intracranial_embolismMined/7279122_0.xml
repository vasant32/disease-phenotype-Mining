<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study the pathology and treatment of occlusion of cerebral arteries in children were investigated in an attempt to find out an approach to the surgical treatment of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e> of childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We had a total of 55 children with cerebrovascular disorders seen at our Institute during the past 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this series there were 19 cases of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The causes in 15 cases of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e> except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in 7 cases, trauma in 2 cases and unknown in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e> had its <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at the age of less than 6 years in 12 of 15 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease began with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was also attended frequently by a <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, which distinguishes the condition from that in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 10 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 lesions the site of occlusion was in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One case in which there was occlusion of the basilar artery occurring in association with trauma was described in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one instance the treatment consisted of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Paroxysmal black out attacks, which had been of frequent occurrence in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> were relieved postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis for cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e> in children should be considered to be indicated only when 1) cerebral angiographic evidence of occlusion or stenosis of a trunk of cerebral artery is still present after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage or 2) no extensive low density area is demonstrable on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgery is generally less indicated in those instances in which the occlusion is due to embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However since <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> may arise from such an arterial lesion, surgery should be considered, or at least its feasibility be evaluated, whenever 1) the underlying cardiac pathology well permits surgical intervention and 2) half a year has passed since an initial attack </plain></SENT>
