<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) of water should be sensitive to the cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> triggered by energy failure during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated values of T2. the nuclear <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> transverse relaxation time of water, seen on T2 nuclear <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images detect vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and infarcted areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The temporal and spatial changes in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and T2 abnormalities after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) were therefore estimated by these two quantitative techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Permanent MCAO was performed on rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and T2 maps of brain water were obtained, from which the ischemic volumes were calculated at various times up to 48 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The areas of decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> represented 36 +/- 7% of the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (24 hours) at 0.5 hours and 64 +/- 4% at 5 hours after MCAO, suggesting that there is recruitment of peripheral areas with disturbed energy metabolism and cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and T2 contours closely matched at 3.5, 24, and 48 hours after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: T2 imaging can assess ischemic insults as well as <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> imaging, but only 3.5 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Assessment of edematous swelling (approximately 24.5% of total infarcted volume) demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and therefore T2 imaging detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the tissue that will become infarcted approximately 7 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The spread of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and T2 abnormalities would therefore stop at approximately 7 hours, and any further increase in volume observed on the images would be mainly due to edematous swelling </plain></SENT>
