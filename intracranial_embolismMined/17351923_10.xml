<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The percutaneous left atrial appendage transcatheter occlusion system (PLAATO) is an alternative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and contraindications to anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It appears to be protective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in intermediate follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypothesis: The PLAATO system is protective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and is safe in long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients (age 72 +/- 9 years) enrolled in the PLAATO feasibility and safety trial at our institution were followed (36 +/- 1.4) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had contraindications to anticoagulation and had at least one risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk for this cohort was 8.6% per year as calculated using the CHADS2 score (A validated scoring system assigning 1 point for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and age &gt;75 years, and 2 points for history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point was the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and secondary end points were complications related to PLAATO device and systemic embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during follow-up; the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in our population was 3% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in these patients after occluding the left atrial appendage is comparable to what would have been observed with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No systemic embolic events were noted in our cohort and no long term complications related to PLAATO were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The PLAATO device decreases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a high-risk cohort of AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the safety of this device is confirmed during this long-term follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A larger trial is needed to validate these findings </plain></SENT>
