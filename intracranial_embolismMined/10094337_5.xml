<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study which imaging technique is useful in detecting recent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and whether an increase in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> or a decrease in signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images is correlated with enhancement on T1-weighted spin-echo images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-one infarctions with a duration of 9 hours to 27 days were studied in 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images were compared with the contrast-enhancement ratio (CER) on T1-weighted spin-echo images (CER = signal intensity after contrast injection/signal intensity before contrast injection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was linearly correlated with CER, and signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images was inversely correlated with CER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and age of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase was weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo images complement each other in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neovascularization and disruption of the blood-brain barrier in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> can be important in increasing <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
