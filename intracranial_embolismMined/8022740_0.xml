<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with a group of 38 patients under 45 years of age who were examined after an arterial ischaemic cerebral event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed 4 patients (2 males, 2 females; age 17, 24, 38 and 40 years) with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral ischaemia</z:e> was permanent in 3 patients and temporary in 1 and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was the most probable cause based on angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> was only diagnosed by transoesophageal echocardiography (type IA in case 3, IB in the others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> was observed in 3 and this abnormality, which is known to have a high prevalence in the general population, could at most be an aggravating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our series, we can assume a causal association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in young patients (10.5% among 38 young <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients vs 3% of 30 patients referred for other reasons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment is still under discussion although the consensus would favour surgery if another heart malformation is associated, if a visible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> is identified or if repeated cerebrovascular events occur despite adequate anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies conducted in large series of patients should provide more adequate therapeutic schemas </plain></SENT>
