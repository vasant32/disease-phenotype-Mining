<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of individuals with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> never suffer a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> can occur even with only mild or moderate stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests local factors (other than stenosis severity) at or near the carotid artery bifurcation may be important in determining <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper we investigate the effect of stenosis geometry on flow patterns in the stenosed carotid bifurcation, using concentrically and eccentrically stenosed anthropomorphic carotid bifurcation models having identical stenosis severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computational simulations and experimental flow visualizations both demonstrate marked differences in flow patterns of concentric and eccentric stenosis models for moderately and severely stenosed cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, we identify post-stenotic recirculation zone size and location, and spatial extent of elevated wall shear stress as key factors differing between the two geometries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As these are also rotid plaque more vulnerable to cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> prokey biophysical factors promoting thrombogenesis, we propose that the stenosed carotid bifurcation geometry--or the induced flow patterns themselves--may provide more specific indicators for those plaques that are vulnerable to enhanced thromboembolic potential, and hence, increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
