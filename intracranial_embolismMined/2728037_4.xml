<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess this further, we evaluated 121 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine were therapeutically anticoagulated within 96 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and 41 received no <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> within the first 2 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two groups did not differ significantly with regard to age, sex, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic deficit, or spectrum of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidences of clinically significant brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (2%) and early recurrent embolization (2%) were equally low in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anticoagulation may be employed safely in most patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but that such treatment does not clearly benefit this population as a whole </plain></SENT>
