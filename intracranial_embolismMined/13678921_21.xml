<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in nonselected patients undergoing neuroprotected carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) without preceding multiple-vessel diagnostic angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Protection devices to prevent distal embolization during CAS are presently under clinical investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visualizes recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the brain and may aid in assessing the efficacy of protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Elective CAS was performed in 42 consecutive patients (15 female, 27 male; mean age, 67 +/- 9 years) using six different types of cerebral protection systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent MRI of the brain before and after a total of 44 interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Placement and retrieval of the devices and stent deployment was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New ischemic foci were seen on postinterventional MRI in 10 cases (22.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had sustained a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas no adverse neurological sequelae were associated with the other nine procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the latter, one to three foci (maximum area 43.0 mm(2)) were detected in cerebral regions subtended by the ipsilateral carotid artery in eight cases and by the contralateral carotid artery in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient, 12 ischemic foci (maximum area 84.5 mm(2)) were exclusively located in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI at 4.1 months (median, n = 7) identified residuals of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> only in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neuroprotected CAS is associated in about 25% of cases with predominantly silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest manipulation of endoluminal equipment in the supraaortic vessels to be a major risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during neuroprotected CAS </plain></SENT>
