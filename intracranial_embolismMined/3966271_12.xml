<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen rats were subjected to right internal carotid artery homologous blood embolization after electrocautery of the pterygopalatine artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four rats were subjected to sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography before and for up to four hours postinsult was used to verify the distal migration and fragmentation of the emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preembolic mean rCBF was 62 +/- 9 ml  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>100g-1  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>min-1 and 65 +/- 12 ml  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>100g-1  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>min-1 in the embolized and contralateral sides, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based upon the distribution of the emboli at sacrifice, the experimental group of 12 rats fell into three subgroups: unilateral proximal embolism, n = 8; unilateral peripheral embolism, n = 3; and bilateral proximal embolism, n = 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In unilateral proximal embolism the mean rCBF in the embolized hemisphere ranged between 10 and 20 ml  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>100g-1  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>min-1 and correlated well with changes in EEG power spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In unilateral peripheral embolism, the mean rCBF in the embolized hemisphere fell significantly 30 min postembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It returned progressively towards preembolic values as the embolic clots migrated distally and fragmented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite the restoration of rCBF, recovery of EEG activity appeared to be delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results did not show luxury perfusion after embolic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The time course for the reopening of the embolized artery and the delay in recovery of neuronal function (i.e., EEG activity) relative to the restoration of rCBF are discussed </plain></SENT>
