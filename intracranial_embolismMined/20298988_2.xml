<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Presence of string sign is a well-known factor for adverse events in patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> undergoing CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients who underwent carotid angiography with the intention to undergo carotid stenting and had angiographically documented string sign in the target lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From October 2006 to August 2007, 25 patients (21 men and 4 women, mean age 70.9 +/- 8.7 years) presented with string sign during carotid angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was 6.0% of a total of 416 patients studied during the time of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (80.0%) were symptomatic, and 5 (20.0%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery stenting was performed successively in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proximal cerebral protection was applied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 12-month follow-up neurological events did not occur; 1 patient developed a nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and another patient died from noncardiac cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 12-month <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 4.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid stenting under proximal cerebral protection seems to be a feasible and safe procedure to manage patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in presence of angiographic string sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further prospective trials are required to prove efficacy of CAS in larger study populations </plain></SENT>
