<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current protective strategies, including deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and retrograde cerebral perfusion, are used to prolong the tolerated duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, and the latter may also decrease the possibility of air/particle embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the neurochemical marker S-100 is related to the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, when the influence of embolic injury has been minimized by the use of retrograde cerebral perfusion during the last part of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Arterial serum levels of S-100 were followed before, during and after reconstructive surgery of the thoracic aorta during deep hypothermic arrest in ten adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retrograde cerebral blood perfusion was used during the latter part of the arrest period in eight of the ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic status was followed daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients survived the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median (range) duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was 184.5 (121-386) min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> and retrograde cerebral perfusion was 50 (3-118) min and 16 (0-84) min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>S-100 increased from 0.10 (0.02-0.18) microg/l preoperatively to 2.37 (0.64-10.80) microg/l after CPB (P&lt;0.01), followed by a decrease to 0.79 (0.21-2.64) microg/l on the first postoperative day (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> correlated with S-100 levels after CPB (r(S) = 0.71, P&lt;0.05) and even better with the S-100 levels on the first postoperative day (r(S) = 0.83, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant correlation between duration of arrest and duration of CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> without retrograde cerebral perfusion correlated well with S-100 levels on the first postoperative day (r(S) = 0.88, P&lt;0.01), but not significantly with S-100 levels after CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: S-100 levels after aortic surgery with deep hypothermic arrest correlate with the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, indicating that the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> is damaging to the brain despite the use of deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and partial retrograde cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The highest correlation between S-100 and duration of arrest was seen on the first postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>S-100 appears to perform well under clinical circumstances as a sensitive and discriminative marker for neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
