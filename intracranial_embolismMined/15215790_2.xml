<SENT sid="9" pm="?"><plain>QUESTION: What is the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk of retrograde catheterization of the aortic valve in patients with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The study was prospective and randomized; unblinded treatment but with blinded assessment of outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The study was conducted at a single center in Bonn, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 152 patients with known or suspected AS undergoing cardiac catheterization were randomized to catheterization with or without retrograde passage of the aortic valve in a 2:1 randomization format </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the day before and within 48 hours after cardiac catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with unclear echo findings or contraindications to MRI or transesophageal echocardiography were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no significant baseline differences between the 2 groups: mean age 70.5 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 62%, and mean aortic valve gradient 51 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated in the groups to which they had been randomized and, other than the experimental intervention, the 2 groups were treated similarly (with the exception of the administration of 5000 units of intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> to the group receiving retrograde aortic catheterization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A control group of 32 patients without aortic valvular stenosis was evaluated as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of retrograde passage of the aortic valve for the purpose of obtaining an invasive aortic valve pressure gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral embolic events, defined by MRI findings within 48 hours after catheterization (as compared to precatheterization MRI) and by clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two of 101 patients (22%) assigned to retrograde catheterization developed new focal MRI abnormalities consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients (3%) demonstrated clinically apparent neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>None of the patients who did not undergo retrograde catheterization--and none of the control patients--had MRI or clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
