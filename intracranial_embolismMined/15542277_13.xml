<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the introduction of cerebral protection systems, neurologic complications during CAS cannot completely be prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler and detection of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> may aid in assessing the efficacy of different neuroprotection systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 42 patients with internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> were treated by CAS using either a filter (E.P.I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FilterWire, Boston Scientific Corp., Santa Clara, California) (n = 21) or a proximal endovascular clamping device (MO.MA system, Invatec s.r.l., Roncadelle, Italy) (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signal counts were compared during five phases: placement of the protection device, passage of the stenosis, stent deployment, balloon dilation, and retrieval of the protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in clinical or angiographic outcomes between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to the filter device, the MO.MA system significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts during the procedural phases of wire passage of the stenosis, stent deployment, balloon dilation, and in total (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts for the filter device were 25 +/- 22, 73 +/- 49, 70 +/- 31, and 196 +/- 84 during the three phases and in total, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts for the MO.MA system were 1.8 +/- 3.2, 11 +/- 19, 12 +/- 21, and 57 +/- 41, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to a filter device the MO.MA system led to significantly lower <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> counts during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The detection of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> by TCD may facilitate the evaluation and comparison of different neuroprotection systems </plain></SENT>
