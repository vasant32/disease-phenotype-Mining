<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular disease was a leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from 1955 to 1980 in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate from this disease has decreased sharply in recent decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This downward trend seems to correspond to the dietary habits of Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from a large prospective cohort study were analyzed to examine the association between dietary habits and cerebrovascular disease mortality in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects for this analysis were 223,170 men and women aged 40 to 69 at baseline in December 1965 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 6,168 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in men and 4,862 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in women due to cerebrovascular disease (ICD7: 330-334) during the follow-up period from January 1966 to December 1981 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) adjusted for sex, attained age, follow-up period, prefecture, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking and occupation was used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, the risk of mortality from cerebrovascular disease was inversely associated with dairy milk, meat and fish consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore the joint effect of dairy milk, meat and fish (DMF) as animal fat and protein was of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the binary analysis, DMF (D, M, F) means the combination of dairy milk (1-3 times/week or more), meat (1-3 times/week or more) and fish (4 times/week or more) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus DMF (d, m, f) was the reference group having dairy milk (less than 1 time/week), meat (less than 1 time/week) and fish (less than 4 times/week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the disease, the RR of DMF (D, M, F) was 0.68 with 95% CI of 0.63 to 0.74, relative to the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the joint effect of DMF was more strongly associated with cerebral haemorrhage (ICD7: 331, DMF (D, M, F); RR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.55-0.70) than with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (ICD7: 332, DMF (D, M, F); RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70-0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the increasing intake of animal fat and/or protein may have played a key role in reducing cerebrovascular disease in Japan </plain></SENT>
