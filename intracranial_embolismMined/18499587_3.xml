<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with aortic atheroma are at increased risk for neurological injury after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the role of epiaortic ultrasound scanning for reducing cerebral embolic load, and whether its use leads to changes of planned intraoperative surgical management in patients undergoing CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients &gt;70-yr-of-age scheduled for CABG surgery were prospectively randomized to either an epiaortic scanning (EAS) group (aortic manipulation guided by epiaortic ultrasound) or a control group (manual aortic palpation without EAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a comprehensive transesophageal echocardiographic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was used to monitor the middle cerebral arteries for emboli continuously from 2 min before aortic cannulation to 2 min after aortic decannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological assessment was performed with the National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale before surgery and at hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The NEECHAM <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> scale was used for assessment and monitoring of patient global cognitive function on each day after surgery until hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraoperative surgical management was changed in 16 of 55 (29%) patients in the EAS group and in 7 of 58 (12%) patients in the control group (P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes included adjustments of the ascending aorta cannulation site for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the avoidance of aortic cross-clamping by using ventricular fibrillatory arrest during surgery, or by conversion to off-pump surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During surgery, 7 of 58 (12%) patients in the control group crossed over to the EAS group based on the results of manual aortic palpation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median [range] TCD detected cerebral embolic count did not differ between the EAS and control groups during aortic manipulations (EAS, 11.5 [1-516] vs control, 22.0 [1-160], P = 0.91) or during CPB (EAS, 42.0 [4-516] vs control, 63.0 [5-758], P = 0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The NEECHAM <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> scores and National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale scores were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the use of EAS led to modifications in intraoperative surgical management in almost one-third of patients undergoing CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The use of EAS did not lead to a reduced number of TCD-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> before or during CPB </plain></SENT>
