<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The application of radiofrequency electrocautery to a standard, open-ended transseptal needle has been used to facilitate transseptal puncture (TSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of cardiac tissue coring when this technique is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A model using excised swine hearts submerged in a saline-filled basin was developed to simulate TSP with electrocautery and a standard transseptal needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Punctures were performed without the use of electrocautery and by delivering radiofrequency energy to the transseptal needle using a standard electrocautery pen at 3 target sites (fossa ovalis, non-fossa ovalis septum, and aorta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The tissue of the submerged heart was gently tented, and the needle was advanced on delivery of radiofrequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The devices were retracted, and the needle was flushed in a collection basin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the TSPs without cautery caused tissue coring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For TSPs using electrocautery, the frequency of coring was at least 21% for any puncture permutation used in the study and averaged 37% at septal sites (P&lt;0.001 compared with punctures without cautery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissue coring occurred in 33 of 96 (35%) punctures through the fossa ovalis and in 38 of 96 (40%) punctures through non-fossa ovalis septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of tissue coring at aortic sites was 62 of 96 (65%), which was significantly higher than at the septal sites (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In an animal preparation, TSP at the level of the fossa ovalis using electrocautery and a standard open-ended Brockenbrough needle resulted in coring of the septal tissue in 35% of cases (33 of 96 punctures) </plain></SENT>
