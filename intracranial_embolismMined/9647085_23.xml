<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the incidence, clinical findings, and outcome of neurologic and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (TE) in patients with the Novacor N100 LVAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a subset of patients, transcranial Doppler sonography was used to detect microembolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six patients underwent implantation of a Novacor N100 LVAS for various reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedure was elective in 18 patients and scheduled on an urgent or emergency basis in another 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assist period lasted from 17 to 336 days (109 +/- 88 days); 22 patients were forwarded to heart transplantation after being supported for 140 +/- 87 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> was evident in 17 patients (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were singular in 8 and multiple in 9 patients; in the latter up to 10 TE occurred (mean +/- SD, 1.4 +/- 2 TE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leading neurologic symptoms were unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> in 11, as well as ocular symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> in 12 patients each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Noncerebral TE were detected in 4 patients, 2 of whom underwent an emergency operation for intestinal and iliac <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of TE did not correlate strongly with the interval of LVAS support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebral computed tomography confirmed lesions in 58% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler sonography detected microembolic signals on 67% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recordings, with the microembolic signals being more frequent on days with clinically manifest TE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The outcomes were good, as only 2 patients suffer from neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> is still a major threat for patients with LVAS implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Neurologic sequelae are frequent but have a favorable prognosis, and systemic complications occur considerably less often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patient selection, adequate anticoagulation, and transcranial Doppler sonography may help to reduce the incidence of TE </plain></SENT>
