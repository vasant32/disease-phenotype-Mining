<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This can be demonstrated in brain slices taken from animals several days after lesioning, by analysis of field potential responses to paired-pulse stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now investigated whether and how these remote effects of a cortical lesion can be modified pharmacologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Application of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, MK-801 ((+)-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-10, 11-dihydro-5H-dibnzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24783">imine</z:chebi>), was shown to block induction of immediate early genes and activation of astrocytes as evidenced by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining in the photothrombosis model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, MK-801 did not affect the hyperexcitability that had been demonstrated by field potential recordings in brain slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another series of experiments, lubeluzole ((+)-(S)-4-(2-benzothiazolylmethylamino)-alpha-[(3,4-difluoroph enoxy) <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>]-1-piperidineethanol), which inhibits the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-activated nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> pathway as evidenced by down-regulation of intracellular cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>, was given immediately after induction of the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This reduced hyperexcitability as investigated 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the light of these data one can suggest that a nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-related mechanism may be responsible for functional alterations in the surround of photothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
