<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report the case of a 75-year-old man who underwent a computed tomographic-guided lung biopsy of a left-lower-lobe pulmonary nodule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A few minutes after the procedure, he experienced numbness and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in his right hand; this lasted for approximately 10 minutes and resolved on its own </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar symptoms developed in his left hand and subsided in 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His speech then became garbled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An urgent computed tomographic scan of the head showed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Review of the chest computed tomographic scans that were performed during the biopsy revealed 10 cc of air in the left ventricular cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was placed on 100% forced inspiratory oxygen and was kept in the Trendelenburg position on his left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 4 hours, computed tomography revealed that the air had been absorbed into the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient had no residual neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition to reporting this case, we discuss possible causes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> and the management of the condition after percutaneous lung biopsy </plain></SENT>
