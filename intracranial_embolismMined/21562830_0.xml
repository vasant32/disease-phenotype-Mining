<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This series comprised 133 consecutive patients with 136 carotid stenoses of which 128 carotid arteries (94%) were either symptomatic (93 out of 136 = 68.4%) or had a greater than 70% stenosis (35 out of 136 = 25.7%) and 8 out of 136 were asymptomatic and had stenoses between 50% and 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent neurologic and sonographic evaluation before the procedure and during follow-up (mean 18 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary stent placement was carried out in 110 out of 136 lesions and predilatation was necessary before stent deployment in 26 lesions, </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic periprocedural complications included 3 disabling and 1 non-disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period there were 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unrelated to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> and no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of stenosis decreased from a mean of 81% to a mean of 12.3% immediately after the procedure, 22 patients were defined as restenosis of which 9 were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid stent placement without the use of distal protection devices was found to be a safe and effective procedure with a relatively low incidence of periprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
