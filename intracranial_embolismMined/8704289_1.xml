<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical significance of the increased HMPAO uptake remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, consecutive patients with hemispheric hemorrhagic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> admitted to the hospital were evaluated prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased uptake of HMPAO was determined by visual analysis of SPECT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was determined using the clinical and computed tomography (CT) criteria including the Toronto Embolic Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 500 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, SPECT was performed in 458 at a mean time 5 +/- 7 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A strong association was found between SPECT perfusion patterns and pathogenic subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in 95% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> the focal absence of perfusion was found, and 26% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> presented with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SPECT appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean volume of lacunar lesions that did not produce significant abnormalities on SPECT was 2.5 +/- 1.2 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased HMPAO uptake was associated with a cardioembolic mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: High and mixed perfusion patterns were present subacutely in 29% of patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, compared to 15% of patients with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt; or = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increased uptake of HMPAO on SPECT as determined by visual analysis is associated with a cardioembolic mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, which could be explained by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-mediated trapping of the tracer during reperfusion and later in newly developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
