<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine the number of cerebral microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) and their time of occurrence during the two most frequent types of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery: coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and cardiac valve replacement (VR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we sought to examine the association between <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>, patient characteristics, and intraoperative parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients were studied, 15 of whom had CABG and 27 VR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected with the use of transcranial Doppler monitoring of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number was significantly higher during VR (median, 1048) than during CABG (median, 82) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In VR patients, 85% of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected when the heart regained effective ejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During CABG, the highest number was detected when the aorta was cross-clamped (18%) and on release of the side clamp (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The numbers of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during the period when the aorta was cross-clamped and in association with surgical procedures were not significantly different in the two patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was inversely correlated to nasopharyngeal temperature (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher number of cerebral <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected during VR than during CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The highest number occurred in VR patients when effective heart ejection was regained and in CABG patients when the aorta was cross-clamped and on release of the side clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The total number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> increased at lower nasopharyngeal temperatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler monitoring may alert the surgical team when emboli enter the cerebral circulation during CPB surgery, thus allowing preventive measures to be taken </plain></SENT>
