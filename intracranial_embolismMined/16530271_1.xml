<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to develop a new model of embolic hindbrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the rat that closely resembles the clinical situation and that can be used to study pathophysiology and treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After thoracotomy in 20 male Wistar rats, 15 animals received an injection of in vitro prepared autologous blood clots into the left vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five animals without clot injection served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were assessed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals 2 h after embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 h, five animals were sacrificed to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-antipyridine autoradiography, and to calculate early cerebellar swelling by comparison of both hemispheres in brain slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these animals, autoradiography revealed ipsilesional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and significantly reduced blood flow values relative to the contralateral (unaffected) structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistology showed the typical pattern of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the brain stem and/or cerebellum in 7 of 10 animals allowed to recover to 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, successful <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was achieved in 12 of 15 animals (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With this novel model, the pathophysiology and potential treatments of posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can be investigated </plain></SENT>
