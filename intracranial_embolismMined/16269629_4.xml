<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to test in vitro, whether hemodynamic parameters other than flow ratios between bifurcation branches may affect the distribution of embolic particles in a Y-shaped bifurcation model, used as an analogue to an arterial bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro experiments were conducted using suspensions of sphere-shaped particles (0.6, 1.6, and 3.2 mm) in water-glycerin mixture, using steady and pulsatile laminar flow regimes in a Y-shaped bifurcation model (identical branching angles [theta1=theta2=45 degrees] with one daughter branch diameter wider than the other [D1=6 mm, D2=4 mm]; average Reynolds number 500) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Experiments using naturally buoyant particles under steady flow conditions and four outlet-flow ratios revealed that small (0.6 mm) and mid-sized (1.6 mm) particles entered into either the narrower or wider bifurcation daughter branch nonpreferentially, proportionally to the flow ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large particles (3.2 mm), however, preferentially entered the wider daughter branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as the flow ratio increases this phenomenon was augmented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further experiments revealed that the preference of the wider daughter branch for high particle-to-branch diameter-ratios further increases under pulsatile flow and by the density ratio between particles and fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Particles' distribution in a bifurcation is affected, beyond its outlets-flow-ratios, by the particle-to-branch diameter-ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The tendency of large particles to preferentially enter the wider bifurcation branch, beyond the flow ratio, is augmented under pulsatile flow conditions and is affected by particle-to-fluid density-ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may have important implications for understanding the hemodynamic mechanisms underlying the trajectory of large emboli </plain></SENT>
