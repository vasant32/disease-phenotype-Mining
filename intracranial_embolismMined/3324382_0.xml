<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Coagulation and platelet parameters have been assessed following implantation of a Jarvik 7 artificial heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially an ongoing intravascular coagulation could not be overcome with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The in vivo formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (as monitored by measurement of the major urinary metabolite) was increased 3-4 fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Administration of aspirin every second to third day reduced the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> formation dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In parallel to this, the intravascular coagulation subsided, the demand for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> decreased considerably and the clinical condition of the patient improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These events provide evidence for a direct link between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> formation and the coagulation cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> formation was insufficiently suppressed around the 110th postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two weeks later the patient suffered a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, followed by a <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the embolized area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the applicability of antiplatelet treatment when the need for efficient antithrombotic treatment is especially pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aspirin, however, is not the ideal drug for this purpose </plain></SENT>
