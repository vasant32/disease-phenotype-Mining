<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the recurrent reductions of carotid flow, spasm and small and multiple defects indicating platelet aggregates or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the constricted carotid segment were observed in 8 and 5 of 20 preparations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, large defects indicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were observed at the outlet of the constricted segment in the other 2 preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the reduction of cerebral flow, spasm was observed in the internal carotid artery and cerebral arteries in 9 and 8 preparations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, obstruction of the cerebral arteries with "cut-off" sign indicating emboli was observed in the other 2 preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes appeared singly or in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that spasm, platelet aggregates, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and/or emboli were responsible for the recurrent reduction of carotid and cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
