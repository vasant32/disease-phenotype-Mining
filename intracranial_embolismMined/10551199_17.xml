<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop guidelines for the use of echocardiography in the investigation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OPTIONS: (1) Routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE); (2) routine transesophageal echocardiography (TEE); (3) routine TTE followed by TEE if the TTE findings are noncontributory; (4) selective TTE or TEE in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> who would not otherwise receive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES: This article reviews the available evidence on the yield of TTE and TEE in detecting cardiac sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the effectiveness of treatment for cardiac sources of emboli and the effectiveness of screening echocardiography for secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EVIDENCE: MEDLINE was searched for relevant articles published from January 1966 to April 1998; also reviewed were additional articles identified from the bibliographies and citations obtained from experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: Echocardiography can detect intracardiac masses (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, vegetation or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>) in about 4% (with TTE) to 11% (with TEE) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The yield is lower among patients without clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> by history, physical examination, electrocardiography or chest radiography (less than 2%) than among patients with clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> (less than 19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risks of echocardiography to patients are small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TTE has virtually no risks, and TEE is associated with cardiac, pulmonary and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications in 0.18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with an identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> are at increased risk for embolic events (absolute risk uncertain, range 0%-38%), and this appears to be reduced with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy (absolute risk reduction uncertain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy carries a risk of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> of 1% to 3% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall effectiveness of echocardiography in the prevention of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VALUES: The strength of evidence was evaluated using the methods of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RECOMMENDATIONS: There is fair evidence to recommend echocardiography in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> by history, physical examination, electrocardiography or chest radiography (grade B recommendation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against TEE in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results of TTE (grade C recommendation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine echocardiography in patients (including young patients) without clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> (grade C recommendation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Routine echocardiography is not recommended for patients with clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> who have independent indications for or contraindications to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy (grade D recommendation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There is fair evidence to recommend <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> (grade B recommendation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There is insufficient (no) evidence to recommend for or against any specific therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (grade C recommendation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>VALIDATION: The findings of this analysis were reviewed through an iterative process by the members of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care </plain></SENT>
