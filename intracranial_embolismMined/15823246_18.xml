<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The functional significance and neuroprotectiove mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatins</z:chebi> in ischemic brain injury is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of study is to evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> on ischemic brain injury and to investigate the perfusion capability of brain microvessels in the ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study included two series of experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first series, we studied if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> is neuroprotective in an embolic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatments began 2 weeks before middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured at 48 h post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were assessed at 2 h, 24 h and 48 h post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats which received saline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> was 32.5 +/- 9.3% (mean +/- SD) and 18.7 +/- 6.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> group was significantly smaller than in the controls (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> also improved neurological deficits and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> significantly (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the second series, we studied if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> can improve microvascular reperfusions after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Perfusion deficits were detected at 8 h post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using Evens blue dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were assessed at 2 h and 8 h post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Results showed that perfusion deficit in saline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>-treated groups were 58.7 +/- 8.7% and 23.4 +/- 7.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The perfusion deficit in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>-treated group was decreased 61% (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These studies thus suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> is a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50267">protective agent</z:chebi> in ischemic brain injury and this protective effect may be partially due to its action in the improvement of microvascular reperfusion </plain></SENT>
