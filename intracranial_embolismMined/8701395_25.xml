<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no patients with deficiency of protein C or protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four had resistance to activated protein C (APC) and one had APC resistance associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APC resistance was investigated by DNA analysis, and diagnosed by the presence of a point mutation in the factor V gene, which predicts replacement of Arg506 with Gln at one of the two APC cleavage sites in activated factor V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of APC resistance was 20% in patients and 2.7% in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.01) and the odds ratio was 9.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A circumstantial factor predisposing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (such as oral contraceptive intake, pregnancy, puerperium, trauma or prolonged immobilization) was reported in 72% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, APC resistance is the most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormality</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
