<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3 to 3.5 kg were used for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 20 were subjected to intracranial autologous clot embolization via the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three hours postembolization, rabbits received an intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> (6.3 mg/kg, 20% bolus with the remainder infused over a 2-hour interval; 12 animals) or vehicle (eight animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were observed for a total of 7 or 8 hours postembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These two groups were compared to a cohort undergoing sham operation with subsequent <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> infusion (four animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples to quantify complement component C5 hemolytic activity (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36120,55311">C5H5O</z:chebi>) were obtained at the following time points: 30 minutes before and after clot embolization; 1 hour before and 1 hour after the initiation of therapy with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> or vehicle and at the completion of the protocol; 7 to 8 hours after clot embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The C5 activation was not detected as the result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, animals receiving <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> with or without concomitant clot embolization exhibited C5 activation as assessed by a reduction in C5 hemolytic function, both 1 hour after initiation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> infusion (78.7 +/- 10.3% and 77.5 +/- 9.9% of baseline value, respectively; mean +/- standard error of the mean [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>]) and at the end of the protocol, 2 hours after the completion of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> infusion (72.5 +/- 8.8% and 53.3 +/- 8.1%, respectively; mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, p &lt; 0.05, each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study supports the conclusion that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, may activate the complement cascade in this rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
