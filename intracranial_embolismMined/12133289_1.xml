<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the relative value of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in exploring the potential embolic source (PES) in heart and aortic arch and to study the clinical significance of aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (AAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TEE and TTE were used to evaluate the potential source of emboli in aortic arch, heart and duplex in the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An atherosclerotic lesion of the aortic arch was defined as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, mild plaque, moderate plaque, and protruding plaque or mobile plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 49 patients, 31 (63%) patients showed evidence of AAA: 7 (14.1%) patients were mild, 9 (18.4%) were moderate and 15 (30.6%) were severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those 15 patients, 11 had neither severe ICAA nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients had internal carotid arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The potential sources of embolization of heart and aortic arch is 48.98% by TEE, but only 18.4% by TTE; 9 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age and ICAA were significantly correlated with AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: At present, TEE is a better method for exploring <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AAA is an important potential source of cerebral embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
