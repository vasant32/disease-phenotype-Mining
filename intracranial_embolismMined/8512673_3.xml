<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of brachial plexus injury and proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0009831'>mononeuropathy</z:hpo> in the hemiplegic extremity is complicated by the upper motor neuron findings on physical examination and by the diffusely abnormal electrodiagnostic test results frequently seen in hemiplegic limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the incidence of brachial plexus injury and proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0009831'>mononeuropathy</z:hpo> after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemiplegic patients (n = 50) underwent physical examination, needle electromyography of the hemiplegic extremities and nerve conduction studies across the brachial plexus within 4 months after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combining the physical examination and electromyographic findings we were unable to make a diagnosis of brachial plexus injury or proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0009831'>mononeuropathy</z:hpo> in any hemiplegic patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous electromyographic activity was observed in 68% of the arms and 70% of the legs examined on the hemiplegic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severity and incidence of spontaneous activity was evenly distributed in upper and lower trunk muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean central latencies across the lower brachial plexus were slightly delayed (12.5 +/- 2 v 11.6 +/- 2.2 ms, P &lt; 0.01) compared with the contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limb, but in no case was the F wave unilaterally unelicitable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean hypothenar compound muscle action potential amplitude was diminished (7 +/- 2.7 v 9.2 +/- 4.1 mV, P &lt; 0.01) in the hemiplegic hand compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side and the degree of amplitude loss inversely corresponded (r = -0.6, P &lt; 0.01) to the amount of spontaneous electromyographic activity observed in the first dorsal interosseus muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
