<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> is obscure in up to 40 percent of patients with this disorder who are studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this investigation, we determined the frequency of ulcerated plaques in the aortic arch and explored the part they may play in the formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an autopsy data bank, we studied the prevalence of ulcerated plaques in the aortic arch in 500 consecutive patients with cerebrovascular and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic diseases</z:e> who were studied at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ulcerated plaques were present in 26 percent of the 239 patients with cerebrovascular disease but in only 5 percent of the 261 patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic diseases</z:e> (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After we controlled for age and heart weight, the adjusted rates were 16.9 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively (adjusted odds ratio, 4.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 7.8; P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with cerebrovascular disease, the prevalence of ulcerated plaques in the aortic arch was 28 percent in the 183 patients with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 20 percent in the 56 patients with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of ulcerated plaques was 61 percent among the 28 patients with no known cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, as compared with 22 percent among the 155 patients with a known cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for covariates, the prevalence was 57.8 percent among patients with no known cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and 20.2 percent among those with a known cause (adjusted odds ratio, 5.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 to 13.6; P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of ulcerated plaques in the aortic arch was not correlated with the presence of extracranial internal-carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, suggesting that these were two independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ulcerated plaques in the aortic arch may play a part in causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, especially in patients in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> has no known cause </plain></SENT>
