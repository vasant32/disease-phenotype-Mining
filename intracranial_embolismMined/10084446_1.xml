<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes the case of a 27-year-old woman taking oral contraceptives who experienced an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic right hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three days after rehabilitation admission (33 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) she developed a left femoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) despite appropriate prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further diagnostic workup for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and DVT identified R-APC, possibly exacerbated by oral contraceptives, as the etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematology consultation recommended lifetime anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's family history revealed that a 19-year-old cousin had died of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> several years earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several months after discharge, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DVT occurred in the patient's 28-year-old brother, who tested positive for factor V Leiden, a genetic abnormality closely associated with R-APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in her grandfather a few months later, but he was not tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Her father demonstrated a "borderline" positive R-APC test and probably represents the genetic link </plain></SENT>
