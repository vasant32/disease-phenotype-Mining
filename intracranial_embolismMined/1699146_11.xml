<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the brain from Cases 1 and 2 found many white and fibrin microthrombi together with ischemic and infarctic changes in the territories of spastic arteries, which corresponded to the low-density areas (LDAs) observed on computed tomographic (CT) scans and the typical neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Case 3, who had suffered severe vasospasms in bilateral anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries, bilateral LDAs were observed on CT scans and multiple fibrin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were seen diffusely throughout the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Case 4, extensive bilateral LDAs (lt greater than rt) were observed on CT scans, and multiple microthrombi were seen diffusely but predominantly in the left cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only in Case 3 the possible complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> could not be ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only negligible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were observed in Cases 5 and 6, whose immediate cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was considered to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and aneurysmal rerupture, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distributions of microthrombi were significantly greater in the regions clinically identified to have been ischemic or infarctic </plain></SENT>
