<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also in this group a distinct clustering of emboli was seen during the first year after transition to CAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On this background it is suggested that patients with PAF may benefit from treatment with anti-arrhythmic agents in order to prevent the development of CAF and that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention seems especially desirable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
