<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Neurocognitive sequelae after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are frequently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the possible difference between on- and off-pump CABG patients in a long-term perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We administered seven standardized neuropsychological tests 1 day before, 6 days after, 6 months after and 3-5 years after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured intra-operative high intensity transient signals (HITS) as a reflection of embolic load by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 74 patients originally recruited, 54 of the patients (73%) (mean age 59 years+/-7.5 years) completed the neuropsychological battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>Cognitive decline</z:hpo> was defined as 20% decline on two or more tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three to 5 years after the operation, 30% of the patients showed neurocognitive problems in domains of non-verbal immediate memory and attention, speed for visual search, visual attention and mental flexibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither difference in frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> nor a difference in evolution over the 5 year time period between on- and off-pump patients was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three to 5 years after the CABG surgery no difference in neurocognitive deficits is found between on- and off-pump CABG patients, indicating that the extracorporeal circulation (ECC) may not be the main cause of late neuropsychological decline </plain></SENT>
