<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report summarizes the perioperative results from eight initial interventional neuroradiology centers in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The report focuses on 403 patients who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> from a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were treated within 15 days of the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and were followed until they were discharged from the hospital or died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy percent of the patients were female and 30% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' mean age was 58 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> size was categorized as small (60.8%), large (34.7%), and giant (4.5%); and neck size was categorized as small (53.6%), wide (36.2%), fusiform (6%), and undetermined (4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven percent of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were located in the posterior circulation and 43% in the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two patients were classified as Hunt and Hess Grade I (20.3%), 105 Grade II (26.1%), 121 Grade III (30%), 69 Grade IV (17.1%), and 26 Grade V (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in this study were excluded from surgical treatment either because of anticipated surgical difficulty (69.2%), attempted and failed surgery (12.7%), the patient's poor neurological (12.2%) or medical (4.7%) status, and/or refusal of surgery (1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The GDC embolization was performed within 48 hours of primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 147 patients (36.5%), within 3 to 6 days in 156 patients (38.7%), 7 to 10 days in 71 patients (17.6%), and 11 to 15 days in 29 patients (7.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion was observed in 70.8% of small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with a small neck, 35% of large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and 50% of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A small neck remnant was observed in 21.4% of small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with a small neck, 57.1% of large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and 50% of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Technical complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (2.7%), unintentional parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (3%), and untoward cerebral embolization (2.48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was a 8.9% immediate morbidity rate related to the GDC technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were related to technical complications (1.74%) and 18 (4.47%) to the severity of the primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study demonstrate the safety of the GDC system for the treatment of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> in anterior and posterior circulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The authors believe additional randomized studies will further identify the role of this technique in the management of acutely ruptured incranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
