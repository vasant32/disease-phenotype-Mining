<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of neuroprotective drugs on the early and late electrophysiological manifestations of photothrombotic occlusion of distal branches of middle cerebral artery was studied in rats treated with MK-801 and Cerebrolysin (CL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DC potentials were recorded from the irradiated cortex (ischemic core), from the adjacent penumbra zone and from remote intact cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Irradiation elicited after a few minutes of spontaneous spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (SD) waves followed during 10-15 min by focal ischemic depolarization (FID) developing in the irradiated cortex and spreading into the perifocal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the core FID amplitude reached about 30 mV and decayed during subsequent 2 h to 10-13 mV, FID in the penumbra zone was broken by periods of partial repolarization and returned during 30-90 min almost to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the same time, generation of spontaneous SD waves almost stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., 45 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) blocked SD waves, but did not shorten penumbra FID, the decay of which was slowed down to the rate found in the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CL treatment (2.5 ml/kg, i.p. , 1 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) did not influence FID in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the experiment, but its 10-day administration facilitated post-ischemic recovery indicated by higher amplitude of evoked SD waves penetrating into the former penumbra zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Morphological examination showed that the volume of total and partial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was increased in the MK-801 group and marginally reduced in the CL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the absence of the SD-induced hyperperfusion episodes in MK-801-treated rats may accelerate perifocal thrombotization in this model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
