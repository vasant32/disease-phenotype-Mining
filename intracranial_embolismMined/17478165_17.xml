<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the safety of percutaneous transcatheter <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure in patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, or arterial desaturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, symptomatic reduction in MH was determined after interatrial shunt closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 252 patients referred to the University of California, Los Angeles, with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, 131 underwent closure of the interatrial communication with a CardioSEAL (n = 30) or Amplatzer (n = 101) device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was evaluated with transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was conducted at 1 to 2 months with echocardiography, with clinical assessment annually thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At an average follow-up of 30 months, there was no recurrence of any thromboembolic event (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or peripheral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a reduction in MH, defined as the complete resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or a &gt;50% reduction in the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> days, in 85% of patients after <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Temporary problems after device implantation, including chest discomfort and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, were reported in 23% of patients and occurred more frequently in patients with <z:chebi fb="152" ids="28112">nickel</z:chebi> hypersensitivity (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, transcatheter <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure is an effective and safe therapeutic modality in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and MH associated with interatrial shunting in patients who present with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pending randomized, controlled trials are necessary to determine if this invasive approach is preferable to medical therapy for the prevention of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or as primary treatment for patients with MH </plain></SENT>
