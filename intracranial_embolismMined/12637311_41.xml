<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to demonstrate the safety of the device and to determine if sonography accelerates thrombolysis and improves clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients aged 40-77 years with anterior- or posterior-circulation occlusion presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> 3-6 or 4-13 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with the catheter and simultaneous intraarterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Procedural and clinical information, including time to lysis, degree of recanalization, National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was recorded before treatment and afterward (immediately and at 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior-circulation emboli; four patients, with posterior-circulation emboli (NIHSS score, 9-23 [mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>18.2] and 11-27 [mean, 18.75], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred at 24 hours: two from <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and one from cerebral swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> also occurred at 1 week and 1 month after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">Myocardial Ischemia</z:e> grade 2-3 flow was achieved in eight patients in the first hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Average time to recanalization was 46 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean NIHSS scores in eight of nine survivors at 90 days were 5 in the anterior-circulation group and 3 in the posterior-circulation group; mean mRS scores at 90 days were 2 and 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No catheter-related adverse events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of the EKOS MicroLysUS infusion catheter is feasible in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies to evaluate its efficacy are warranted </plain></SENT>
