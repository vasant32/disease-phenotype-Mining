<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In guidelines we read that elective surgery, at the asymptomatic stage, can only be recommended in selected patients, at low operative risk (see guidelines of European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association), but we have not read any reference to patients with severe calcific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> after symptomatic spontaneous calcium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is associated with poor prognosis compared to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, in patients with asymptomatic severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> and spontaneous calcific embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> valve replacement appears to offer the best hope of avoiding a recidivation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and should be considered in most cases </plain></SENT>
