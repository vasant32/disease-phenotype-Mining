<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral barotrauma, or the neurological manifestation of the "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011119" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bends</z:e>", is a relatively common disease of divers and aviators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, however, no-one has succeeded in demonstrating a cerebral or spinal cord lesion in vivo following a decompression incident, despite the presence of definitive clinical signs and symptoms of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the use of 99Tcm-labelled hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (99Tcm-HMPAO) with single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography in a study of three individuals involved in driving accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three suffered cerebral barotrauma during decompression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exhibited clinical signs and symptoms of dysbarism to a varying degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed at time intervals ranging from 2 h to several days following the incidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed well defined cerebral ischaemic lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 99Tcm-HMPAO imaging provides a significant advance in locating and demonstrating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> following barotrauma and will contribute greatly to our understanding of the pathophysiological processes involved </plain></SENT>
