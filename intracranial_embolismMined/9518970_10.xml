<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eligible Medicare patients older than 65 years of age hospitalized in 1985 were followed up for 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models were used for assessment of risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 4,282,607 eligible Medicare patients were hospitalized in 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 76.1 (+/- 7.7) years; 58.7% were female; 7.2% were Black; and 8.4% had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 66,063 patients (32.6/1000 person-years) developed nonembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 7285 (3.6/1000 person-years) developed embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, race, sex, and comorbid conditions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> remained a significant risk factor for both nonembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (relative risk [RR] = 1.56) and embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (RR = 5.80) and for mortality (RR = 1.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 4.5% of nonembolic and 28.7% of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> among hospitalized Medicare patients aged 65 years and older were attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is associated with an appreciable increase in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (both embolic and nonembolic) and in the risk of mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes </plain></SENT>
