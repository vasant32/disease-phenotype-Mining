<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 234 patients (135 men and 99 women; mean age [±SD] 76 ± 11 years) with initial cardiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> with NVAF who were admitted to our hospital between April 2007 and March 2011, the CHADS(2) score, use of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, and clinical outcomes were retrospectively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CHADS(2) scores were as follows: 0 points, n = 21 (9%); 1 point, n = 72 (31%); 2 points, n = 92 (39%); 3 points, n = 47 (20%); and 4 points, n = 2 (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use rate was low (14.1%; n = 33), and it was significantly (P = .023) lower for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (8%) than for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (18.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score after 3 months were: CHADS(2) score 0 points, mRS 0 to 2 (81%) and 3 to 6 (19%); 1 point, mRS 0 to 2 (46%) and 3 to 6 (54%); 2 points, mRS 0 to 2 (46%) and 3 to 6 (54%); and ≥3 points, mRS 0 to 2 (29%) and 3 to 6 (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome worsened as the CHADS(2) score increased (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that being ≥75 years of age and having a high National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score on admission were related to a poor outcome (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use rate was low in initial cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with NVAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes deteriorated with increases in the CHADS(2) score, age ≥75 years, and NIHSS score on admission were related to a poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
