<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biodistribution of INPLT was determined in 12 control pigs (30-35 kg, unoperated control [n = 6] and sham operated control [n = 6]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CPB was carried out with (n = 6) and without (n = 6) an arterial filter in 12 pigs at a flow rate of 2.5-3.5 L/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelets labeled with In-111 tropolone (650-780 microCi) were injected intravenously 24 hr before CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pigs were systemically heparinized (activated coagulation time &gt; 400 sec); CPB was instituted with a roller pump, an extraluminal blood flow oxygenator (Bentley Univox, 1.8 m2), and an arterial filter (0.25 m2) and continued for 3 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet kinetics, pooling, and counts were monitored by a Geiger probe and a Coulter counter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the oxygenator and arterial filter and emboli in viscera and brain were imaged with a gamma camera and measured with an ion chamber and gamma counter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Percentage of INPLT (mean +/- SD) in organs, tissues, and components of the circuit in four groups of pigs was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry with antibodies to CD61 (GPIIIa) and CD62P (<z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140: control) of porcine platelets was carried out with blood samples taken before, during, and after CPB for estimation of circulating platelet aggregates and platelet microparticles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> in pigs undergoing CPB with and without a filter were similar (p &lt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The amount of filter adherent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> was small (0.04 +/- 0.01%); oxygenator adherent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in both groups was similar (p &lt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Emboli were found in the cerebral medulla, hippocampus, and posterior cerebral cortex in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During CPB, the arterial filter functioned minimally as a trap for platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> detached from the oxygenator and circulating emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry of blood demonstrated the shift of equilibria from single platelets to platelet aggregates and microparticles during CPB and their gradual reversal to single platelets after CPB; the loosely adherent emboli disaggregated and further shifted these equilibria to single platelets and smaller aggregates, probably through the action of endogenous nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The emboli were trapped in organs and tissues and microparticles were sequestered by the reticuloendothelial system </plain></SENT>
