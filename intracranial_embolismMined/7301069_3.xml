<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although 4 of 5 grafts removed after 5 to 8 days were patent (80%), long term patency was observed in only 1 graft (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aspirin treatment did not influence patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the lack of a neoendothelial layer upon the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surfaces of patent grafts, which were covered with a fibrin-blood cell lining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subintimal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> resulted in stenosis at sites of anastomosis in thrombosed grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The graft length, its small caliber, and a 40% decrease in blood flow after implantation may have contributed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the bypass graft in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Synthetic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> microvascular grafts may not be suitable for clinical use in extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
