<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Advances in interventional catheter technology have made it possible to dilate stenoses also in the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e>, but primary stent implantation may fixate atherosclerotic material on the vessel wall and thus prevent embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Marked stenosis in the ICA was treated by balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in 71 consecutive patients aged between 40 and 85 years (mean 69 +/- 9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If possible, a stent was implanted before the first balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A stent was placed before <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in 53 of 76 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>Dilatation</z:mpath> with a small balloon to allow stent placement was necessary in 23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus stent implantation before definitive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of stenosis was reduced from 79 +/- 11 to 9 +/- 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures the stenosis was reduced to less than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had a severe and two had a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient died of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> 2 days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus the neurological complication rate was 3.9% and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate 1.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up examination revealed an asymptomatic occlusion of the ICA after two weeks in one patient, a recurrent stenosis after 6 months in two of 46 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients the degree of stenosis was less than 50% at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Primary stent placement before balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in ICA stenosis was possible in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This procedure would thus seem to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
