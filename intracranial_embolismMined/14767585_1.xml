<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective animal study in a university medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Fifteen Landrace/Yorkshire pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: In 15 anesthetized pigs ICP, PbrO(2), PbrCO(2) and brpH were measured with multi-parameter sensors, and brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> by microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these parameters were recorded for 2 h after injection of air into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine animals were hyperventilated (PaCO(2 )+/-25 mmHg) and hyperoxygenated (FiO(2) 1.0) and six animals were normoventilated (PaCO(2)()+/-40 mmHg with an FiO(2) 0.4) and served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group the ICP rose from 8+/-1 to 52+/-6 mmHg, which was similar to that in the control group (12+/-1 to 57+/-8 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of the 2-h study period, there were no significant differences in PbrO(2), PbrCO(2) and brpH between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decreased brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and increased brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> reached severe pathological values in both groups by the end of the 2-h study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>Hypocapnia</z:mp> and hyperoxemia in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CAE did not improve pathological functional brain parameters compared with normoventilated controls </plain></SENT>
