<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate of events per minute was acquired for the following five operative periods: from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) set-up to CPB start, from CPB start to aortic clamping, first minute after aortic endoclamp inflation, first minute after aortic endoclamp deflation, and first ten minutes from CPB weaning start </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoclamp navigation into the aortic arch, CPB start and CPB weaning determined the highest absolute count of embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When embolic rate was normalised for length of selected operation periods CPB start (1.58+/-1.9 events/min), endoclamp inflation (1.42+/-1.7 events/min) and endoclamp deflation (3.1+/-3.5 events/min), resulted as the most critical phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No side prevalence was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e> during port-access mitral valve procedures occurs predominantly at CPB start and during ascending aorta clamping and unclamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic arch navigation with catheters exposes to the risk of cerebral embolic events </plain></SENT>
