<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We screened 2215 consecutive patients when they entered the Medical Emergency Department for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The decision on correct use or underuse of oral anticoagulation was made from the charts by consensus of two experienced physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was 3.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>43 of 83 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> had oral anticoagulation (52%, mean age 76 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>32 patients were treated with Aspirin only (38%, mean age 79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>29 patients (35%) did not receive anticoagulation because of accepted contraindications, i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and risk for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> (n = 16), history of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (n = 6), drug malcompliance due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>forgetfulness</z:hpo> (n = 4) and psychiatric disease (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Underuse of anticoagulation occurred only in three patients (4%, unclear reasons in two patients, patient's unwillingness in one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We did not observe substantial underuse of anticoagulation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
