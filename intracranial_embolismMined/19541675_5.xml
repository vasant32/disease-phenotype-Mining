<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of the study was to investigate whether intra-operative filter devices protect the brain during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and to determine the impact of solid and gaseous micro-emboli on neuropsychological functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients undergoing CABG received either an intra-aortic filter (Embol-X) (n = 43), designed to reduce solid micro-emboli, a dynamic bubble trap (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi>) (n = 50), designed to reduce gaseous micro-emboli, or no additional device (control group) (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cognitive functioning was assessed before and 3 months after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Micro-emboli signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) were detected during surgery using transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint was the cognitive outcome of the filter groups compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of covariance was performed using the post-operative cognitive test scores as continuous variables in covariance of the corresponding pre-operative scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> rates and the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic lesions after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the controls, cognitive functioning of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> group was better in executive functioning (t = 2.525, P = 0.0065) and verbal short-term memory (t = 2.420, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Embol-X group did not perform better in any test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total number of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was lower in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> group (median 99, P = 0.0019), but not in the Embol-X group (median 162.5, P &gt; 0.05), both compared with controls (median 164.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After surgery, 17 patients displayed small ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> on MRI with equal distribution between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gaseous micro-embolization contributes to neuropsychological decline, which is measurable 3 months post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No filter device could protect the brain during CABG completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the use of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="23686">DBT</z:chebi> tends to improve the cognitive outcome after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Gas filters are recommendable for neuroprotection during cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
