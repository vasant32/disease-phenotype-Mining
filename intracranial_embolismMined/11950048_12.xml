<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was therefore to assess the effect of bioactive coatings on biocompatibility of Nitinol coils designed for the closure of intra-atrial communications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nitinol coils (n = 10, each) and flat Nitinol bands (n = 3, each) were treated by basic coating with poly(amino-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52410">p-xylylene</z:chebi>-co-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52410">p-xylylene</z:chebi>) and then coated with either <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, r-hirudin or fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-thrombogenicity was studied in vitro in a dynamic model with whole blood by partial thromboplastin time (PTT), platelet binding and thrombin generation, respectively, and cytotoxicity by <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelialisation was studied on Nitinol bands with human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2yl)-2,5-triphenyl tetrazolium (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay and immnuofluorescence analysis of Ki67, vinculin, fibronectin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> Factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uncoated or coated devices did not influence <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> and PTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>r-Hirudin (but not <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>) and fibronectin coating showed lower platelet binding than uncoated Nitinol (p &lt; 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> and r-hirudin coating reduced thrombin formation (p &lt; 0.05 versus Nitinol, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HUVEC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, proliferation, and matrix formation decreased in the order: fibronectin coating &gt; uncoated Nitinol &gt; r-hirudin coating &gt; <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> coating &gt; basic coating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay corroborated these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, r-hirudin and fibronectin coating, by causing no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cytotoxicity, decreasing thrombogenicity and increasing endothelialisation improve in vitro biocompatibility of Nitinol devices designed for the closure of intra-atrial communications </plain></SENT>
