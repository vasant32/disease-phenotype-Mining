<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is found in unstable plaques and is detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to ascertain whether intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> as seen on carotid MRI predicts particulate embolization in the dissection phase of CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with high-grade symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> undergoing CEA were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent preoperative MRI assessment of the carotid arteries for intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and transcranial Doppler scanning during the dissection phase of the CEA to assess the presence of microembolic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations between intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and intraoperative microembolic signals were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis was undertaken on 60 participants; of these, 36 (60%) showed ipsilateral carotid MRI intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and 24 (40%) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals were detected during the dissection phase in 23 (38.3%) participants, and 19 had MRI-detected intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association between carotid intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and the presence of dissection phase microembolic signals was significant (odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6 to 19.7, P = .007), even after controlling for age, sex, individual surgeon, degree of stenosis, and delay from symptom to CEA (adjusted OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 30.4, P = .037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> as detected by carotid MRI predicts particulate embolization during the dissection phase of CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This imaging technique can be used to identify patients with increased intraoperative thromboembolic risk, and this could influence preventive strategies </plain></SENT>
