<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report is based on information obtained from a questionnaire sent to major cardiac centres in the United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This produced details of 39 pregnancies in 34 patients after valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 39 pregnancies gave rise to 30 healthy babies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The small size of the series probably reflects both the increasing rarity of young women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> in this country and the cautious attitude of their cardiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This makes it likely that these women represented the best end of the spectrum of cardiac function after valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four pregnancies in 20 women who were not given <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> producted 23 healthy babies and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This group comprised 6 patients with free aortic homografts, 1 patient with a fascia lata mitral valve, 1 with a Beall tricuspid prosthesis, 1 with a combined mitral homograft and Starr <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> aortic prosthesis, and 1 with mitral and aortic frame-mounted fascia lata valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or thromboembolic complications in this group which included 5 patients who were in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifteen pregnancies in 14 women who received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> gave rise to 7 healthy babies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fetal losses were one <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo>, one intrauterine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 34 weeks, and 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo>; one surviving child has <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> as a result of blood clot and there were 2 maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This group included 13 patients with Starr <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> valves, 11 mitral and 2 aortic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A patient with a Hammersmith mitral valve was the only one to have been treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and her valve thrombosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient with a mounted mitral homograft had a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nine of these patients were in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 3 additional patients the valve replacement was carried out during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients survived operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In one of these who was treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> the pregnancy well, but there is an increased fetal wastage in patients pregnancy gave rise to a congenitally malformed baby who died in the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The baby born to the mother who did not receive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> has a hare-lip and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001883'>talipes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Women with artificial valves can tolerate the haemodynamic load of pregnancy well, but there is an increased fetal wastage in patients taking oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This is probably largely attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal haemorrhage</z:e> but there is also a risk of malformation caused by a teratogenic effect of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Experience gained in non-pregnant patients suggests that withholding anticoagulatns in pregnant patients with prosthetic valves would usually be undersirable but <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> should be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The advantages of biological valves were apparent in this series </plain></SENT>
