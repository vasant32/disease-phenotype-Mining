<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> periods, platelet aggregation, platelet count, platelet crit, and mean platelet volume were significantly less in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.05-0.01) while the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> release rate per volume of platelets was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size showed a significant positive correlation with platelet aggregation (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> release rate (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001) but a negative correlation with platelet count (r = -0.44, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that platelet aggregation is reduced during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period due to the consumption of platelets during thrombogenesis but that the remaining individual platelets are <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet consumption during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period increases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> period, platelet crit and mean platelet volume were significantly less in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.01) while the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> release rate was significantly greater (p less than 0.01), suggesting sustained platelet consumption and chronically enhanced secretion of individual platelets </plain></SENT>
