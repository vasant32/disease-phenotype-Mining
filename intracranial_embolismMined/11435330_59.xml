<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Filter devices for cerebral protection potentially reduce the risk of embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Elective carotid stent implantation using 3 different types of distal filter protection devices was attempted in 88 consecutive lesions (84 patients) in the internal carotid artery that had &gt;70% diameter stenosis (mean, 78.7+/-10.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Procedures were performed in 3 different centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 69+/-8 years, 75% were men, and 35.7% had neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 86 lesions, a stent was successfully implanted (97.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 83 of these 86 procedures (96.5%), it was possible to position a filter device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 53% of filters, there was macroscopic evidence of debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collected material consisted of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-rich macrophages, fibrin material, and cholesterol clefts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurological complications during the procedure, in the hospital, and at 30 days of clinical follow-up occurred in only one patient (1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This patient suffered a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that resolved within 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two major adverse cardiac events (2.3%) occurred during the 30 days of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Filter protection during carotid artery stenting seems feasible and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the present series, the incidence of neurological complications was low </plain></SENT>
