<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to evaluate the safety of these interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the incidence and distribution of cerebral microembolic events after carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) with distal protection to standard open carotid endarterectomy (CEA) using DW-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From November 2004 through August 2006, 69 carotid interventions (27 CAS, and 42 CEA) were performed in 68 males at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postprocedure DW-MRI exams were obtained on each patient undergoing CAS and the 20 most recent CEA operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These 46 patients (47 procedures as one patient underwent bilateral CEAs in a staged fashion) constitute our study sample, and the hospital records of these patients (27 CAS and 20 CEA) were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence and location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, postprocedural microemboli were determined using DW-MRIs and assessed independently by two neuroradiologists without knowledge of the subjects' specific procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen CAS patients (70%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 42%-81%) demonstrated evidence of postoperative, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, cerebral microemboli by DW-MRI vs none of the CEA patients (0%, 95% CI: 0%-17%) (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 CAS patients with postoperative emboli, nine (47%) were ipsilateral to the index carotid lesion, three (16%) contralateral, and seven (36%) bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median number of ipsilateral microemboli identified in the CAS group was 1 (interquartile ranges [IQR]: 0-2, range 0-21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median number of contralateral microemboli identified in the CAS group was 0 (IQR: 0-1, range 0-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three (11%) CAS patients experienced temporary neurologic sequelae lasting less than 36 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patients suffered 12 (six ipsilateral and six contralateral), 20 (19 ipsilateral and one contralateral), and zero microemboli, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, performing an arch angiogram prior to CAS was associated with a higher risk of microemboli (median microemboli 5 vs none, P =.04) CONCLUSIONS: Although our early experience suggests that CAS may be performed safely (no permanent neurologic deficits following 27 consecutive procedures), cerebral microembolic events occurred in over two-thirds of the procedures despite the uniform use of distal protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Open carotid surgery in this series seems to offer a lower risk of periprocedural microembolic events detected by DW-MRI </plain></SENT>
