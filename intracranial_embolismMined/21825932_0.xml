<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To determine the incidence, time course, and severity of pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> (PFE) and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> (CFE) in trauma and nontrauma patients at the time of autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospectively, consecutive patients presenting for autopsy were evaluated for evidence pulmonary and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lung sections were obtained from the upper and lower lobe of the patients' lungs on the right and left and brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This tissue was prepared with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30687">osmium</z:chebi> tetroxide for histologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of fat droplets per high power field was counted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The autopsy reports and medical records were used to determine cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, injuries, if cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was attempted, sex, height, weight, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty decedents were evaluated for PFE and CFE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average age was 45.8 years ± 17.4 years, average body mass index was 30.1 kg/cm² ± 7.0 kg/cm², and 68% of the patients were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was determined to be trauma in 68% (34/50) of decedents, with 88% (30/34) blunt and 12% (4/34) penetrating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CPR was performed on 30% (15/50), and PFE was present in 76% (38/50) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjects with PFE had no difference with respect to sex, trauma, mechanism of injury, CPR, external <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusions</z:mp>, fractures, head, spine, chest, abdominal, pelvic, and extremity injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, subjects without PFE had significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0001260'>increased weight</z:mp> (109 ± 29 kg vs. 86 ± 18 kg; p = 0.023) but no difference in height or body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PFE was present in 82% (28/34) of trauma patents and 63% (10/16) nontrauma patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight percent of nontrauma patients and 86% of trauma patients who received CPR had PFE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Trauma patients with PFE showed no significant difference in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight percent of trauma patients died within 1 hour of injury, and 80% (24/30) of them had PFE at the time of autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CFE was present only in one patient with a severe head and cervical spine injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PFE is common in trauma patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CPR is associated with a high incidence of PFE regardless of cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>PFE occurs acutely within the "golden hour" and should be considered in traumatically injured patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate the pathogenesis of PFE </plain></SENT>
