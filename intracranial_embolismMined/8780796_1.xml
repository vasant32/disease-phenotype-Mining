<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Unique insights into the topography of local metabolism/blood flow interrelationships in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have afforded by the recent development of powerful image-processing techniques permitting three-dimensional (3D) autoradiographic image-averaging and analysis of replicate studies by a novel method termed "disparity analysis" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method, based upon a linear affine transformation model, directly estimates scaling, translation and rotation parameters simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The method was validated in awake Wister rats studied for local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism (lCMRgl) with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were subserially sectioned, aligned by disparity analysis, and mapped into a common template so as to generate aggregate 3D data sets of the mean and standard deviation of the entire series (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Internal anatomic architecture was faithfully represented in the average image, and Fourier analysis revealed satisfactory retention of low-frequency information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method was then applied to study metabolism/blood flow relationships in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal ischemic penumbra of Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to distal photothrombotic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, coupled with permanent ipsilateral and 1 h contralateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Matched series were studied for lCBF at 1.5 h and for lCMRgl at 1.25-2 h post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The averaged lCBF image revealed the ischemic penumbra (defined as lCBF 20-40% of control) to form a "shell" around the cortical ischemic core and a confluent aggregate at the anterior and posterior poles of the core-zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>lCMRgl in the penumbra was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, ranging from near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An average lCMRgl/lCBF ratio data set revealed marked metabolism-flow uncoupling in penumbral pixels, averaging nearly five-fold above control ratio values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sustained deflections of the DC potential were recorded in the penumbra, the site of marked uncoupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This analysis defined for the first time the 3D topography of the ischemic penumbra and substantiated marked metabolism/flow dissociation, which is believed to be a metabolic consequence of the energy demand imposed by repeated peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations </plain></SENT>
