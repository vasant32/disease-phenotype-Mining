<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Anticoagulation (AC) may improve outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT), even when complicated by pretreatment hemorrhagic infarction (HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The HI characteristics which affect the decision to initiate AC therapy and its outcome are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience with AC treatment for patients with CVT and HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two groups of patients were compared: those who received AC (n = 6) and those who did not (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> volumes ranged from petechial to large (93 cm3) <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> with mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulated patients received treatment a mean of 11.3 days after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each had exclusively extratemporal HI without midline shift and had stable <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> volumes and clinical status for at least 24 h prior to AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AC did not increase HI volume or worsen clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 non-AC patients had enlarging <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four of these 6 patients had temporal HI; and two required <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AC therapy was avoided in CVT patients with HI that were located in the temporal lobe, caused midline shift or were enlarging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AC was safely initiated within several days in clinically stable patients with non-temporal-lobe HI of unchanging volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the location and unchanged volume on serial CT may be important factors influencing the safety of AC therapy in patients with CVT and HI </plain></SENT>
