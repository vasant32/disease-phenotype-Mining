<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography was performed in 314 patients over a period of 24 months using a 3.5 MHz phased-array system fitted to the distal end of a conventional 12 mm endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients (2.6%) transesophageal echocardiography could not be performed because of adverse reaction to the gastroscopic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Side effects were a transient A-V block in one patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0347950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">asthmatic attack</z:e> in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve lesions were found in 99 of 314 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 9 of these 99 patients (11%), including 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral valve stenosis</z:hpo> and sinus rhythm, 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, 3 with disc, and 3 with porcine mitral prosthesis, spontaneous echocardiographic contrast was found within the left atrium, described as faint echoes in 2 patients and dense echoes filling the whole left atrium and following turbulent flow in the other 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only in 2 patients was left atrium shown to have additional echoes within its cavity in the four-chamber view by transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> were found in 5 of 9 patients and of peripheral embolism in 3 of 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their mechanism seems to involve red cell aggregation, which is greatest at low flow velocity such as in dilated left atria in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral valve stenosis</z:hpo> or prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The additional effect of platelet aggregation must be discussed because <z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>increased platelet aggregation</z:mp> was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with spontaneous echocardiographic contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography seems to be of great diagnostic value in patients with mitral valve lesions and cerebral and peripheral embolism, giving new insight into the pathophysiologic mechanism and possibly improving the therapeutic approach in the near future </plain></SENT>
