<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whether or not to treat patients with non-rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> to prevent embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a dilemma for physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If randomized trials, currently underway, demonstrate a beneficial effect, the dilemma will not be solved because not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the relevant factors can be addressed by trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used current knowledge about non-rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and a method of obtaining patient-derived weights for avoiding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from eight medically trained subjects, to determine the overall benefit of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and to see what factors were relevant and what effect each might have in deciding whether to use <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using standard assumptions, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> gave an expected benefit for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expected benefit (expressed in terms of lives per 1000 saved due to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>) varied between 5.4 and 46.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This benefit remained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects when we did a sensitivity analysis for different rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevented by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and different rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> caused by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we used different baseline rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and different impacts of major hemorrhagic complications the benefit disappeared for 3 and 4 subjects respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found the factors that were most crucial to the decision will not be included in randomized trials; the weight that an individual would place on avoiding embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> vs the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> from <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy; and the rate of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that could be expected for the subject at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors which will be measured in randomized trials, will change results less substantially: the increased risk of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>; the proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that could be prevented by treatment; the increase in risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This method of analysis suggests that for most patients <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> are beneficial and that the most important factor in determining this result is the value that subjects put on different outcomes </plain></SENT>
