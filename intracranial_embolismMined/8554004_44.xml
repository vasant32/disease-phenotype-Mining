<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients found to have foramen ovale during transesophageal echocardiography were divided into two groups on the basis of the maximum number of microbubbles in the left heart in any single frame after intravenous saline contrast injection: group 1 (n = 16) with a "large" degree of shunt ( &gt; or = 20 microbubbles) and group 2 (n = 18) with a "small" degree of shunt ( &gt; or = 3 microbubbles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up over a mean period of 21 months for subsequent systemic embolic events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five (31%) of the patients with large shunts had subsequent ischemic neurologic events, whereas none of the patients with small shunts had embolic events (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These events occurred in spite of antiplatelet or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients with a large degree of shunt across a patient foramen ovale, as determined by contrast transesophageal echocardiography, are at a significantly higher risk of subsequent adverse neurologic events compared with patients with a small degree of shunt </plain></SENT>
