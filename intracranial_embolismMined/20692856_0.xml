<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography showed a small mass in the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent surgical resection, and histological examination of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">papillary fibroelastoma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It remains to be investigated whether heart ultrasound evaluation should be performed before IV thrombolysis in selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, given the apparently increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, IV thrombolysis should not be postponed due to a lengthy investigation, because of its potential for reducing morbidity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
