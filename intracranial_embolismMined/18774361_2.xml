<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility and efficacy of catheter-directed thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> limb embolism in patients with recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients (six men, two women; mean age 63.5 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic occlusion of two left common iliac arteries, four femoral arteries (three left; one right), and two right popliteal arteries were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a history of recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (mean 6 days, range 5-15 days) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (duration 5-10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Catheter-directed thrombolysis started a few hours (mean 6.2h; range 3-10h) after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of arterial embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two 5mg boluses of rt-PA were injected into the proximal clot through a 5 F end-hole catheter and, subsequently, two additional boluses of 5mg rt-PA were injected into the emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with residual emboli, infusion with rt-PA (1mg/h) was continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed in three patients, and a stent was deployed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical success rate was 87.5% (7/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The one clinical failure was secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusion of outflow runoff vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of continuous rt-PA infusion was 3.6h, the mean total dose of rt-PA administered was 23.6 mg (range 20-28 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale scores during thrombolysis and no intracerebral haemorrhage was found at computed tomography (CT) after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Minor complications included haematomata at puncture sites (6/8), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> around the vascular sheath (2/8), and haematuria (1/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period of 3-6 months, one patient suffered from recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Catheter-directed thrombolysis with rt-PA is an option for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lower extremity arterial embolism in patients with recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies should be undertaken to determine the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage caused by catheter-directed thrombolysis in individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
