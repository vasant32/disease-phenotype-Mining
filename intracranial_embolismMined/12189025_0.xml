<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective study in 40 patients undergoing CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet activity was measured by whole blood flow cytometry and platelet aggregometry during CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of P-selectin and the PAC-1 antigen were used as markers of platelet activation and aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received aspirin (75-300 mg) preoperatively and 5,000 units unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High intensity transient signals (HITS) in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery were monitored using transcranial Doppler (TCD) perioperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: P-selectin expression increased after carotid clamping (P &lt; 0.01) and clamp release (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was higher expression of PAC-1 after carotid clamping (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation increased after carotid clamping (P&lt; 0.01) and release (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD monitoring showed an increased HITS count from preoperative levels, after clamp release (P &lt; 0.01) and during recovery (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the operation, patients with more than 50 HITS per 30 min were started on an infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran 40</z:chebi> (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>P-selectin expression decreased 24 h after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran 40</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significant platelet activation and aggregation occurs during CEA despite the current use of antiplatelet treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran 40</z:chebi> had an antiplatelet effect after CEA providing further evidence that it may contribute to reducing thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
