<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Up to October 1975 a total of 206 mitral commissurotomies were performed in Berne </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>170 patients underwent closed commissurotomy (CMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the period from 1973, 36 patients underwent open commissurotomy (OMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To compare results and operative risk as between OMC and CMC, the last 36 consecutive patients of the CMC group were selected for critical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Though not coinciding chronologically the 2 groups turned out to be essentially comparable with regard to preoperative clinical and hemodynamic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In neither group was there a hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency and severity of postoperative complications did not prove to be greater following OMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral embolism</z:e> was observed in 3 cases after CMC, whereas this complication occurred only once following OMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of clinical, radiological and electrocardiographic data, OMC must be considered superior to CMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of significant residual stenosis and the risk of causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> appear to be lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Without involving a higher operative risk, the open approach to mitral commissurotomy offers the following main advantages: safe removal of intraatrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, precise and complete incision of the fused commissures under direct vision, avoidance of leaflet tears, separation of fused chordae tendineae and incision of papillary muscles in order to remove <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subvalvular stenosis</z:e>, debridement of calcium from leaflets, and repair of concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> by valvuloplasty </plain></SENT>
