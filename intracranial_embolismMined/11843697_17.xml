<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The significance of the stenotic lesions of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in Asian patients with striatocapsular small, deep infarctions (SSDIs) remains undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency of stenotic lesions of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in patients with SSDIs and to evaluate clinical and radiological features in those same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry of a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred two Korean patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic SSDIs underwent cerebral angiography or magnetic resonance angiography and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We divided these patients into 2 groups-patients with and without <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical and magnetic resonance image features were compared between these 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (36%) had an ipsilateral proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesion, whereas 65 patients (64%) showed no <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> abnormality on cerebral angiography or magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 65 patients without an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesion, 18 had an embolic source; the remaining 37 patients had no demonstrable embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the temporal profile and magnetic resonance imaging findings between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the type of lacunar syndrome and the volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> did not differ between the groups, the unstable temporal profile and magnetic resonance imaging findings of multiple small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the symptomatic hemisphere were frequently observed in patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesion was a common cause of SSDIs in Korean patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Depending on the existence of an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesion, the clinical course and magnetic resonance imaging feature of the patients with SSDIs were different </plain></SENT>
