<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A gel ultrasound phantom was connected to a circuit in which blood-mimicking fluid circulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Air bubbles (100-140 microm) and latex spheres (125 +/- 10 microm) were injected into the circuit and interrogated using 1- and 2-MHz transducers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-intensity-transient-signals (HITS) were recorded with a dual-gated transcranial Doppler (TCD) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver-Operating-Characteristic curves determined the best cut-off points that would distinguish between embolic materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HITS from air bubbles had higher intensities and longer SVL than solid spheres with either transducer (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Air bubbles (P &lt; .0001) and microspheres (P= .049) showed higher intensities with the 1-MHz relative to the 2-MHz transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intensity increase with the 1-MHz transducer was greater for air bubbles than microspheres (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The discriminating efficacy of both the relative-intensity and SVL was similar between transducers (intensity, P= .201; SVL, P= .98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relative-intensity and SVL are equally effective to distinguish solid from air emboli using 1- and 2-MHz transducers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that using a lower carrier frequency does not improve the discrimination of air from solid emboli </plain></SENT>
