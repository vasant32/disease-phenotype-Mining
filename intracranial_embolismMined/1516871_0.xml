<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>defects in the atrial septum</z:hpo> have been described as an important route for cerebral and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These include classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, as well as the less well-recognized entity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, with or without interatrial communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combined incidence of these defects in the general population is between 20-35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The introduction of transesophageal echocardiography and the use of echogenic contrast have lead to significant improvement in identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe 3 patients in whom atrial defects were identified as possible routes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>: The first presented with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> was found in a patient with 2 prosthetic values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third was a soldier in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> was found following transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on our modest experience and review of the literature we believe that transesophageal and contrast echocardiography should be performed in every young patient with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
