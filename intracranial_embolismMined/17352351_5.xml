<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic options include antiplatelet agents, anticoagulation, percutaneous device and surgical closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the hypothesis that there are differences in rates of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between patients in the four treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients presenting from January 1997 with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> were followed prospectively until June 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment choice was made on an individual case basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcome was a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our cohort consisted of 121 patients; 64 (53%) were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median age was 43 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine percent presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 31% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One or more vascular risk factor was present in 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>Atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) was present in 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of antiplatelet agents (34%), anticoagulation (17%), device (39%) and surgical closure (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recurrent events occurred in 16 patients (9 antiplatelet, 3 anticoagulation, 4 device closure); 7 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 9 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Comparing individual treatments there was a trend toward more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the antiplatelet arm (p = 0.072); a significant difference was seen for the composite endpoint (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Comparing closure versus combined medical therapy groups, a significant difference was seen for primary (p = 0.014) and secondary (p = 0.008) outcomes, favoring closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Age and pre-study event predicted outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>Patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> closure was associated with fewer recurrent events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Complications of surgical and device closure were self-limited </plain></SENT>
