<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To explore the value of transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography in the periprocedural monitoring of patients undergoing angioplasty procedures for stenosis of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients were included in the study between April 1991 and September 1995 (6 females, 26 males; average age 66 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were interrogated before and after angioplasty by a standard TCD examination protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedurally, TCD was used continuously to monitor cerebral blood flow and supply evidence of embolic particulates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) alone; the other 13 underwent primary stent (PS) implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-intensity transient signals indicative of emboli appeared to be more frequent in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> group than in the PS cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative TCD identified 3 (9%) high-risk patients with incompetent collateral pathways through the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively, TCD detected two postdilation carotid occlusions, a sylvian embolism, and one case of arterial spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The preprocedural TCD in a patient with contralateral carotid occlusion showed good collateral circulation, providing reassurance during conversion to endarterectomy when an undeployed stent obstructed blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, TCD confirmed restored intracerebral circulation and identified one hyperperfusion syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD is a simple, relatively inexpensive examination that can preprocedurally identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> patients at high risk for intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> might be preferable to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the procedure, TCD can document the benefits of endovascular treatment and offer early detection of ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
