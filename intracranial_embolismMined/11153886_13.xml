<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with bithalamic infarction represented 0.6% of our registry which included 2,750 ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement, there were 4 topographic patterns of infarction: 1) bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the territory of paramedian artery (8 patients [50%]); 2) bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the territory of thalamogeniculate arteries (3 patients [19%]); 3) bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving territory of paramedian and thalamogeniculate arteries (3 patients [19%]); 4) bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving territory of polar and thalamogeniculate arteries (2 patients [13%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A specific clinical picture was found in up to 50% of the patients with bithalamic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This included patients with bilateral paramedian infarction having disorder of consciousness, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunctions</z:e>, various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339652" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertical gaze palsy</z:e> and psychic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral sensory loss predicted accurately bilateral infarction in the territory of thalamogeniculate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main cause of bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> was small artery-disease, followed by cardioembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cognitive functions in patients with bilateral paramedian infarction did not change significantly during the follow-up, in contrast to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in varied arterial territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> bilateral infarction involving both thalamus is uncommon, although they are often associated with specific neurologic-neuropsychological patterns, allowing diagnosis before radiological examination </plain></SENT>
