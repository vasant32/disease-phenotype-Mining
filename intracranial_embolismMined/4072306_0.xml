<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the period of the examinations no patient had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients showed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747057" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organic heart disease</z:e> without any stronger functional effects (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients were without any complaints and capable to work, apart from the intermittent or persisting disturbance of rhythm which continued to appear in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and had again <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basis findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in six of them echocardiographical deviations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basis findings and a.p. at first a good prognosis is to be assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regular control examinations are, however, necessary, that the manifestation of organic basic disease which appears among our patients in 1/4 of the cases is not overseen </plain></SENT>
