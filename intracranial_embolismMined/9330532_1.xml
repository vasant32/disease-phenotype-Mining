<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of a partially thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> on the basilar tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed the opacified lumen of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was 25 x 15 mm with a broad-based neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a transfemoral approach, a microcatheter was guided through the vertebral artery and placed directly into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> under local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interlocking detachable coils were deposited into the patent portion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, resulting in 95% obliteration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and preservation of the parent artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No complication was observed during or after surgery </plain></SENT>
