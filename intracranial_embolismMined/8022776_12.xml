<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A bilateral photochemically induced thrombotic lesion of rat sensorimotor cortex (approximately 3 mm in diameter and 25 mm3 in volume) is associated with a persistent cognition (learning and memory) deficit, which was evaluated with water maze tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The N-dichloroacetylsphingosine derivative of lysoGM1 (LIGA20) administered after the lesion either i.v. or per or reduces the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by 30-40% and attenuates the associated cognition deficits, presumably by limiting the extent of damage of neurons at risk located in the surroundings of the infarcted core (i.e., area penumbra) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LIGA20 protection is dose and time dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximal protection is afforded by a single dose of LIGA20 of 34 mumol/kg i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1 hr after lesion or by a dose of 270 mumol/kg per os when administered 1 hr and 24 hr after the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of LIGA20 can be observed when the drug is administered i.v. up to 6 hr after the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protective efficacy of the oral administration of LIGA20 is related to its physiochemical properties, which, unlike those of GM1, allow absorption from the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LIGA20 given orally reaches the brain promptly and rapidly inserts into the neuronal membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here, by an unknown molecular mechanism, LIGA20 selectively reduces the pathological amplification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signaling elicited by persistent stimulation of ionotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors in the area penumbra </plain></SENT>
