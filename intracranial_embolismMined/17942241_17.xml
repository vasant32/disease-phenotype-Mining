<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone</z:chebi>), a polyphenolic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> 12/15-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi> would attenuate oxidative cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vitro using a mouse hippocampal HT22 cell assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we determined if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> would be useful to attenuate behavioral deficits associated with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> ischemic events in vivo using a rabbit small clot embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model (RSCEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using HT22 cell in vitro, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> was shown to significantly promote cell survival with an estimated dose for 50% cell survival of 2 muM following incubation in the presence of iodoacetic acid (20 muM), an irreversible inhibitor of the glycolytic pathway that results in the free radical production, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> was neuroprotective and attenuated iodoacetic acid (<z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp>) toxicity in vitro, we studied its effects in vivo in an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model using behavioral measures as the endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantal analysis for each treatment in the embolism model identifies the quantity of microclots (mg) that produce neurologic dysfunction in 50% of a group of animals (P(50)), with intervention considered neuroprotective if it increases the P(50) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">Baicalein</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg, s.c.) injected 5 and 60 min post-embolization significantly (P&lt;0.05) improved behavioral function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The calculated P(50) values were 2.85+/-0.64 mg (n=21) and 2.15+/-0.12 mg (n=14), respectively compared with 1.37+/-0.20 mg (n=23) for the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> effectively attenuated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vitro using HT22 cells and also significantly reduced behavioral deficits in rabbits when given up to 1 h following an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi>, or derivatives of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> with multiple pharmacological activities may be useful to develop as novel treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
