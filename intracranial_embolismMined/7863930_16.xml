<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report three patients, each of whom had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rethrombosis of a reopened middle cerebral artery after urokinase treatment for proximal stenosis (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the stenosis was performed adjunctive to the thrombolytic treatment to preserve the success of the thrombolysis), and a fourth patient who had percutaneous transluminal angioplasty right after the completion of thrombolysis and had no rethrombosis despite a partial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thrombolytic treatment was carried out by a coaxial technique with a Tracker 18 catheter through a 5-F angiographic catheter; 80,000 U in 5 mL of urokinase were intermittently injected every 15 minutes after an initial dose of 250,000 U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were given 3000 U of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> with a booster dose of 1000 U every hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was performed with a Stealth catheter balloon, 2 to 3 mm x 1.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients recovered without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was unsuccessful in one patient because of the inability to pass a 2-mm Stealth balloon catheter, and the result was a second rethrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This patient had a poor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the middle cerebral artery may be associated with severe proximal stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rethrombosis may occur even after complete thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty may be safely performed to prevent rethrombosis </plain></SENT>
