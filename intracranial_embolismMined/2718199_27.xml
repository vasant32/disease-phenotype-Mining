<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic infarction during the month after the embolic event was evident in 65 patients (40.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial angiography a median of 1.5 (range 1-60) days after the event revealed occlusion of the cerebral arteries in 117 of 142 patients (82.4%), and reopening of the vessels was observed in 56 (94.9%) of 59 patients who had follow-up angiography a median of 20 (range 3-47) days after the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of hemorrhagic infarction was higher in patients greater than or equal to 70 years old (31 of 61, 50.8%) than in those aged 50-69 years (27 of 72, 37.5%) or less than 50 years (seven of 27, 25.9%) (greater than or equal to 70 vs. less than 50, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with moderate or large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, hemorrhagic infarction developed in 50.0% or 51.5%, respectively, while in those with small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> it developed in only 2.9% (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between hemorrhagic infarction and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or blood pressure during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic and/or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy did not affect the incidence of hemorrhagic infarction (40.0% with vs. 40.7% without therapy) but tended to cause massive <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that hemorrhagic transformation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> is caused not only by reopening of the occluded vessels but also by other factors such as age and size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
