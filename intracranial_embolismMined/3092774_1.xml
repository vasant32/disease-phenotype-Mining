<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases of pregnancy and 7 tubal ligatures were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 4 pregnancies continued of term and preceded by cardiac catheterisation, there were two maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> on the 2nd and 7th day of the postpartum period due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> confirmed in one case and suspected in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A third pregnancy was complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and one case of tubal ligature was complicated by non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases were compared with previous reports in the literature to form a total of 42 cases of pregnancy in women with the Eisenmenger syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pregnancies were characterised by aggravation of dyspnoea and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> in 72.4 p. cent of cases, by documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> in 7 cases and by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">toxaemia of pregnancy</z:e> in 26 p. cent of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The global mortality was 36 p. cent and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> but one occurred between the time of labour and the 11th postpartum day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Micro pulmonary thromboses were the commonest cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two mechanisms seem to combine to aggravate the cardiac status at the end of pregnancy and during the initial postpartum period: increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> due to a rise in pulmonary resistances, due particularly to changes in coagulability favored by pregnancy; increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> due to a decrease in systemic vascular resistances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A number of poor prognostic factors were identified: decreased oxygen saturation in arterial blood and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">toxaemia of pregnancy</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
