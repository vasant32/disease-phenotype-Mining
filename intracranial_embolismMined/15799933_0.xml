<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study details a single-center experience with the 3F Therapeutics stentless aortic bioprosthesis(investigational device) and is part of a prospective,nonrandomized worldwide multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the implantation procedure and the valve's efficacy in terms of early mortality and morbidity and early echocardiographic valve performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 2001 and March 2004, 24 patients (14 men/10 women) underwent aortic valve replacement(AVR) with a 3F valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 72 +/- 13 years(range, 31-88 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combined revascularization was performed in 12 patients; 1 patient received biatrial ablation therapy, 1 patient a myectomy, and 3 patients combined carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic systolic gradient and valve performance were investigated intra- and postoperatively by Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 2 perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 1 non-valve related, due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> in an 83-year-old woman, and 1 fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in a 77-year-old woman 5 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 102 +/- 32 minutes,aortic cross-clamp time was 79 +/- 24 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sizes for implanted 3F valves were 5 x 23 mm, 6 x 25 mm, 7 x 27 mm,and 6 x 29 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up systolic gradient results were 11.5 +/- 4.7 mm Hg at 30 days (n = 21), 11.4 +/- 4.5 mm Hg at 6 months (n = 18), and 13.3 +/- 4.4 mm Hg at 12 months (n =13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period trivial central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> was found in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The 3F aortic valve shows favorable preliminary hemodynamic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Owing to the new valve design,implantation technique is simplified compared with other stentless valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation treatment is mandatory for the first 3 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Long-term observation is necessary to assess life span and durability </plain></SENT>
