<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through the collateral circulation, these emboli can reach the homolateral cerebral territories producing further ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups of patient, with angiographically proven internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, one with, and another without irregular arteriosclerotic lesions (IAL) in the stump and/or external carotid artery, were followed up in order to determine the frequency of delayed post-occlusion ischemic events in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral events occurred more frequently when there was a stump associated with IAL in the remnants of bifurcation and signs of ophtalmic collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This association may have prognostic value and should be considered before performing bypass procedures </plain></SENT>
