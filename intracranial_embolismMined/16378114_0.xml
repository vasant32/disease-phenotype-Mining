<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Healthy male Wister rats were randomly divided into the following groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(1) Control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) 600 microsphere group and 900 microsphere group, in which 600 or 900 microspheres were injected into the right internal carotid artery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3) 600 treatment group and 900 treatment group, in which 600 or 900 microspheres were injected into the right internal carotid artery, respectively, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Water maze tasks were tested for 5 consecutive days from the 7th postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rats were then decapitated and regions of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The activities of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase and cholinesterase and the binding activity of muscarinic receptor were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The latency periods were significantly longer in the 900 microsphere group than in the control group and in the 600 microsphere group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(2) The percentages of effective search strategy were significantly lower in the 600 and 900 microsphere groups than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They were significantly higher in the 600 and 900 treatment groups than in the corresponding microsphere groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(3) The activities of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase of cerebral cortex were significantly lower in the 900 microsphere and two treatment groups than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They were also significantly lower in the 600 and 900 treatment groups than in the corresponding microsphere groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Those of striatum were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly lower in the microsphere and treatment groups than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(4) The activities of cholinesterase of cerebral cortex were significantly lower in the 900 microsphere group than in the control and 600 microsphere groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>They were significantly higher in the 900 treatment group than in the 900 microsphere group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Those of hippocampus were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly lower in the microsphere and treatment groups than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>(5) The binding activities of muscarinic receptor of cerebral cortex were significantly lower in the 900 microsphere and two treatment groups than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>They were also significantly lower in the two treatment groups than in the corresponding microsphere groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Those of hippocampus and striatum were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly lower in the microsphere and treatment groups then in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>They were also significantly lower in the 600 or 900 treatment group than in the corresponding microsphere group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral microsphere embolism caused significant and quantity-dependent impairment of learning and memory function and cholinergic system in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> alleviated learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunction</z:e> caused by cerebral microsphere embolism, but further inhibited the parameters of central cholinergic system </plain></SENT>
