<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown recently in rats that photothrombotic local brain injury that is induced by the intravenous injection of the photosensitive dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and skull irradiation with a beam of focused light can trigger the expression of the protein p53 and initiate DNA damage in the area surrounding the thrombotic/necrotic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that these changes are the signs of injury-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used pharmacological tools to characterize the injury-triggered DNA damage that we assayed by TUNEL-labeling, followed by a computer-assisted quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of apoptotic cells was visualized by fluorescent staining with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pharmacological approach included: (a) the inhibition of endonucleases by intracerebroventricular injection of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA, 20 micrograms/5 microliters); (b) the inhibition of protein synthesis by injecting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> subcutaneously (2.5 mg/kg); and (c) the blockade of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors by injecting 2.5 mg/kg dizolcipine (MK-801) intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These treatments significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells that we counted in the area surrounding the necrotic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that injury-induced DNA damage involved de novo synthesis of proteins and an activation of endonucleases, suggesting the occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this model, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was associated with an activation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatments targeted at halting the apoptotic process might provide protection after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or after trauma to the brain </plain></SENT>
