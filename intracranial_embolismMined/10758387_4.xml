<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with atherosclerotic aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are at greater risk for brain complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our techniques and results of operation using selective cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 52 consecutive patients with atherosclerotic aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (mean age, 70 years, range, 53-86 years), who underwent operation between April 1992 and March 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operation was non-elective in 11 patients (21.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitant operations included eight coronary artery bypass grafting and one aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous distal aortic reconstruction was performed in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The operation was performed through median sternotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To avoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain embolism</z:e>, total arch replacement with a branched prosthesis was performed in 48 patients, in an attempt to exclude affected segments of aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, retrograde femoral artery perfusion was avoided and cerebral circulation was isolated before aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To achieve even blood flow distribution, we employed perfusion and continuous pressure monitoring of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three arch vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The perfusion rate was 12+/-2 ml/kg per min and the pressure was kept around 50 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Deep hypothermic arrest of the lower torso (bladder temperature, 22 degrees C) was used during open distal aortic anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hospital mortality rate was 11.5% (six of 52), and 7.3% (three of 41) for elective cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only one patient (1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>9%) developed permanent focal neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Six other patients showed temporary brain complications, which was global (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e>) in three and focal in three others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Selective cerebral perfusion is a safe brain protection method, and our strategy seems effective for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
