<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Embolic complications are a major prognostic determinant in the clinical course of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE) with an incidence of about 30-50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to analyze risk factors leading to embolism in native (NVE) and prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (PVE), we reviewed 177 consecutive patients; 43% were female, 57% male, PVE occurred in 24% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> left-sided, among the NVE were 11% right-sided IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major embolic complications occurred in 40% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In NVE, a higher rate of embolic events (45% vs. 26%; p &lt; 0.05), and a larger vegetation size compared to PVE was observed (14 +/- 6 mm vs. 11 +/- 5 mm; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most important risk factor for embolic complications in NVE was Staphylococcus aureus (odds ratio 6.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, double valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and mitral valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> were associated with the risk for embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In case of severe regurgitation the rate of embolic complications was reduced (54% vs. 77%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In PVE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> was a risk factor for embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Staphylococcus aureus was also a frequent microorganism in embolism (45% vs. 22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The in-hospital mortality was significantly increased in case of embolism (NVE 40% vs. 11%; p &lt; 0.001; PVE 36% vs. 9% p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>About 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> embolic events occurred before admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In NVE, due to high in-hospital mortality, the rate of patients with embolism undergoing surgery was lower (57% vs. 72%; p &lt; 0.05); whereas in PVE no significant difference was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with NVE, aspirin therapy because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> appeared to reduce the rate of embolic complications (11% vs. 47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the low number of patients on aspirin (9%) does not allow recommendations regarding a potential benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, identification of risk factors leading to embolism in IE may be useful in considering early surgical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the high rate of embolic complications before hospital admission indicates a need for improving the diagnostic delay in the prehospital phase </plain></SENT>
