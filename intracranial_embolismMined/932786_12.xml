<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Formalin fixation does not alter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values so that fixed brain appears to be suitable for this type of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low attenuation values in CCT correlate better with changes in specific gravity, rather than water in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but they have a close relationship to water content in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high water content in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the white matter reveals a striking disparity in fluid control between cortex and white matter, which has not been emphasized in experimental studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Water movement within and around blood clots has been discussed </plain></SENT>
