<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative cerebral microembolization is believed to be one of the most important etiologic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a new generation of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, we compared the number and nature of intraoperative microemboli in patients undergoing on-pump and off-pump cardiac surgery procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bilateral continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring of the middle cerebral arteries was performed in 45 patients (15 off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, 15 on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, and 15 open cardiac procedures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> recordings were performed using a multi-range, multifrequency system to allow both measurement of the number and discrimination of the nature of microemboli in the 3 different groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median number (interquartile range) of microemboli in the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, and open procedure groups were 40 (28-80), 275 (199-472), and 860 (393-1321), respectively (P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve percent of microemboli in the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting group were solid compared with 28% and 22% in the on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and open procedure groups, respectively (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the on-pump groups, 24% of microemboli occurred during cardiopulmonary bypass, and 56% occurred during aortic manipulation (cannulation, decannulation, application, and removal of crossclamp or sideclamp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral microembolization is significantly reduced with avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of microemboli occurring during cardiac surgery are gaseous, with a higher proportion of solid microemboli in the on-pump group, and may have a different significance for cerebral injury than solid microemboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ability to reliably discriminate gas and solid microemboli may have an important role in the implementation of neuroprotective strategies </plain></SENT>
