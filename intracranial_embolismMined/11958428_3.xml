<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated whether its systemic administration reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume without increasing the risk of intra-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of the drug was tested on an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rat model that uses white clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after clot embolization, rats were infused with 2.2 mg kg(-1) of monteplase or the same amount of saline, over 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative regional cerebral blood flow had recovered 60 min after monteplase administration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly smaller 24 h after clot embolization in the monteplase-treated rats (47.0 mm3) than in the saline-treated rats (130.4 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, the hemorrhagic transformation area was significantly smaller in monteplase-treated rats (0.8 mm2 vs. 18.0 mm2, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate monteplase can be a promising thrombolytic agent for treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
