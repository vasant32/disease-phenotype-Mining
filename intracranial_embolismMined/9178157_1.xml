<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to identify the source of microembolic signals in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) by taking simultaneous bitemporal transcranial Doppler ultrasound recordings of the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and the contralateral ACA to find the route of potential microembolic material to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 38 patients with an occlusion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With extracranial duplex sonography (ACUSON 128 XP; 7 MHz), performed by an experienced sonographer, the echo intensity and echo structure of the occluded ICA in the extracranial part (proximal) were classified as homogeneous or inhomogeneous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, affected segments of the ipsilateral and contralateral carotid artery with arteriosclerotic vessel walls were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals were recorded with transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The microemboli counts in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA were added to the sum scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of affected segments of the carotid artery on the ipsilateral (the bifurcation, the external or common carotid artery) and contralateral side of occluded ICA were equally distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> 3.1, 7.1 microemboli (average mean, SD) with a range of between 0 and 34 were counted, in the contralateral ACA 0.3, 0.6 (range of between 0 and 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis confirmed the non-predictability of the microemboli variance on the ipsilateral side of the occlusion from the variance on the contralateral side (multiple r: 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found no significant correlation between the echo intensity or echo structure of the occluded artery and an increased rate of microemboli in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a predominantly ipsilateral source for cerebral microemboli in ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rate of cerebral microembolic signals was not influenced by the echo structure and echo intensity of the occluded ICA </plain></SENT>
