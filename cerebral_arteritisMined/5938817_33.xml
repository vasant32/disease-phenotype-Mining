<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Turkey poults injected intravenously with suspensions of Mycoplasma gallisepticum develop a fatal neurologic disease associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264992" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis</z:e> affecting almost exclusively the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incubation period depends on the dose of organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With high doses (10(10) to 10(11) mycoplasmas) the birds become ill and die within a few hours; with lower doses (10(6) to 10(8)) neurologic manifestations appear after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurologic signs after high doses indicates the presence of a toxin in the mycoplasma, but efforts to extract toxin from disrupted organisms or to demonstrate its presence in culture fluid free of mycoplasmas have been unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The toxin appears to be associated only with living mycoplasmas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The toxic component of M. gallisepticum is inactivated by heating the organisms at 50 degrees C, disruption by repeated cycles of freezing and thawing, and exposure to specific antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of turkeys with gold thiomalate furnishes partial protection against the toxic effects of large doses of mycoplasmas, and protection against the development of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> protects completely against both toxicity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, and, when delayed, restores diseased birds to a healthy state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="16962">Cortisone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi> have no effect on the course or outcome of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracerebral injections of M. gallisepticum are less toxic and lethal than when the same dose was given by vein, indicating that the organism exerts its damaging action on blood vessels by way of the blood stream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The arterial lesions resemble those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e>, except for their distribution, and are associated with glomerular inflammatory lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, for various reasons discussed, it is considered more likely that they result from a direct toxic action of living mycoplasmas on the vessels concerned than from an immunologic mechanism </plain></SENT>
