Localized high AMP deaminase activity was found in the rimmed vacuoles of skeletal muscles in acid maltase deficiency, distal myopathy with rimmed vacuole formation, and experimental chloroquine myopathy on histochemical staining. Acid phosphatase activity was also increased in and around these vacuoles, but the vacuoles were negative for other histochemical stainings such as with NADH-tetrazolium reductase, ATPase and phosphorylase. These findings suggest that AMP deaminase is bound to membranous components in addition to myosin in skeletal muscle.
