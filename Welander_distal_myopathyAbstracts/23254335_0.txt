OBJECTIVE: Dysferlinopathies belong to heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive muscular disorders caused by mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin. The classifications of the dysferlinopathies mainly include limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) with predominantly proximal weakness, Miyoshi myopathy (MM) with calf muscle weakness and atrophy, and distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset (DMAT) with tibialis muscle atrophy. We describe the genetic character of dysferlinopathies in a group of Chinese patients. METHODS: DYSF mutations screening were done after muscle biopsy and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Eight patients showed an absence or drastic decrease of dysferlin expression in biopsied muscle. We identified 6 different mutations, including one nonsense mutation, two insertion mutation, two deletion mutations and one splice site mutation. Five of them were novel mutations. CONCLUSION: We described 8 Chinese patients with dysferlinopathy (four had a distal phenotype of MM; one had a phenotype of DMAT and three presented with LGMD2B). It is the first report of genetic confirmed DMAT in China. Mutations c.3112C>T and c.1045dup, may be recurrent mutations in China.
