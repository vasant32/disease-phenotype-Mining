 OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical, pathological, laboratory test and follow-up data between familial and sporadic patients with distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) and discuss the characteristics of this disorder in Chinese population. METHODS: The clinical and pathological features, laboratory data and follow-up results of 33 sporadic and 4 familial cases of pathologically confirmed DMRV were summarized and compared retrospectively. RESULTS: The patients age, onset age, or disease duration showed no significant difference between sporadic and familial cases; the onset pattern and affected muscle groups were also similar, but the sporadic cases showed more frequent dysmorphic features than the familial cases. The patients showed mild to moderate elevation of the muscle enzymes by one to three folds, and the familial patients had more significant elevation than the sporadic ones. No correlation was found between the disease duration and the level of muscle enzymes. The pathological findings were similar between the cases, and Gomori staining showed rimmed vacuoles and inclusion bodies without inflammatory cell infiltration. Follow-up results of 29 cases showed no significant difference between the two groups. The disease was slowly progressive and severely affected the quality of life of the patients, but did not produce obvious effect on the life expectancy. CONCLUSION: The clinical, pathological and laboratory data of Chinese DMRV patients are basically similar to those of Japanese cases. Sporadic cases tend to show more dysmorphic features than the familial ones, and occasional sporadic cases have early disease onset in early childhood.
