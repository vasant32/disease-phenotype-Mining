 BACKGROUND: Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy is clinically characterized by the early involvement of distal leg muscles. The striking pathological features of the myopathy are muscle fibers with rimmed vacuoles. To date, the role of aquaporin-4 water channel in distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy has not been studied. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we studied the expression of aquaporin-4 in muscle fibers of a patient with distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses showed that sarcolemmal aquaporin-4 immunoreactivity was reduced in many muscle fibers of the patient. However, the intensity of aquaporin-4 staining was markedly increased at rimmed vacuoles or its surrounding areas and in some muscle fibers. The fast-twitch type 2 fibers were predominantly involved with the strong aquaporin-4-positive rimmed vacuoles and TAR-DNA-binding protein-43 aggregations. Rimmed vacuoles with strong aquaporin-4 expression seen in the distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy patient were not found in control muscles without evidence of neuromuscular disorders and the other disease-controls. CONCLUSIONS: Aquaporin-4 might be crucial in determining the survival or degeneration of fast-twitch type 2 fibers in distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy.
