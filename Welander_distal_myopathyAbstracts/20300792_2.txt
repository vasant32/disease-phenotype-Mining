Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (IBM2) was mainly reported in Middle Eastern Jewish patients. Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles has been described as a worldwide distributed distal myopathy. Both diseases are caused by mutations of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene. Herein we report two patients: an Egyptian Muslim patient with the "common" Middle Eastern mutation (M712T), rarely described in non-Jewish patients; and an Italian patient carrying a novel GNE mutation (L179F) in the epimerase domain. Our patients share common clinical and histopathological features, with some interesting aspects. The first patient presented a clinical deterioration during her first pregnancy confirming that an increased requirement of sialic acid during pregnancy may trigger a clinical worsening. The second patient showed a slowly progressive deterioration, different from other patients carrying mutations in the epimerase domain, who had a severe and rapid progression.
