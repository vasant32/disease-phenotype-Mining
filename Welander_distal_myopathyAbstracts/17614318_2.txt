Dysferlinopathies exhibit marked heterogeneity in the initial distribution of muscle involvement at the onset of the disease. We describe a Japanese patient with dysferlinopathy who exhibited distal anterior compartment myopathy (DACM) with early contractures of the ankle, whose pedigree included patients with two other types of dysferlinopathy. The existence of three phenotypes of dysferlinopathy in one pedigree is reported, indicating the involvement of molecules other than dysferlin in the pathogenesis.
