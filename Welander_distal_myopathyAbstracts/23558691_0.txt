Introduction: Molecular studies have revealed that some patients with myopathies with rimmed vacuoles have pathogenic mutations in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) and Z-band alternatively spliced PDZ motif-containing protein (ZASP) genes. Methods: We investigated a patient with distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles by muscle biopsy and sequencing of 6 candidate genes. Results: The patient carried GNE compound heterozygous missense mutations (p.V421A and p.N635K) and a ZASP variant (p.D673N). This patient presented with distal weakness sparing the quadriceps muscles and had atypical results for Z-band-associated protein immunostaining. This indicates that the GNE mutations are pathogenic, and the diagnosis is compatible with GNE myopathy. Conclusions: By combining pathological studies and candidate gene screening, we identified a patient with GNE myopathy due to novel GNE compound heterozygous mutations. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
