Two juvenile Rottweiler siblings were presented with the complaint of decreased activity and various postural abnormalities, including plantigrade and palmigrade stance and splayed forepaw digits. The neurologic examinations were otherwise normal. Electromyography revealed rare fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves. Motor nerve conduction velocities were normal, whereas compound muscle action potentials from the interosseous muscles were decreased. These findings were consistent with a primary myopathy. A 3rd pup from a different litter and a 4th pup from a litter with 3 of 8 affected dogs had similar clinical presentations. Histopathologic changes in fresh-frozen muscle biopsy samples were similar in all pups and consisted of myofiber atrophy with mild myonecrosis, endomysial fibrosis and replacement of muscle with fatty tissue. These changes were more severe in distal muscles than in proximal muscles. Plasma carnitine concentrations (total and free) were decreased in all pups. Muscle carnitine concentrations (total and free) were decreased in 3 of 4 pups and the least affected pup had a borderline low free muscle carnitine concentration. Abnormalities involving major metabolic pathways were not found on quantification of organic and amino acids. Dystrophin immunocytochemistry was normal in 2 dogs tested. Distal myopathies in humans are classified under the dystrophic group of muscle disorders. These 4 cases represent a form of muscular dystrophy apparently not previously reported in dogs.
