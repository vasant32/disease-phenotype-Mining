 OBJECTIVES: Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause two autosomal recessive forms of muscular dystrophy: Miyoshi myopathy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B. The purpose of this study was to diagnose a Chinese pedigree with the autosomal recessive form of muscular dystrophy and conduct mutational screening. METHODS: The pedigree was diagnosed accurately by using two-point linkage analysis and multi-Western blot analysis. Mutations were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Two-point linkage analysis showed significant LOD scores with makers from chromosome 2p13. Multi-Western blot analysis confirmed dysferlin deficiency of muscle specimen from the propositus. Mutation analysis of the dysferlin gene revealed a novel mutation, 6429delG, on exon 53. CONCLUSIONS: We identified an inbred Chinese pedigree with Miyoshi myopathy caused by the 6429delG mutation in the dysferlin gene. This mutation is predicted to result in premature termination of translation contributing to Miyoshi myopathy.
