OBJECTIVES: This is a report on a retrospective muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study on 11 patients affected by Welander distal myopathy (WDM) and 22 patients with tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) carried out in order to define the pattern and characteristics of muscle involvement. RESULTS: WDM patients showed involvement of gastrocnemius, soleus, tibial anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL), as well as hamstrings and hip adductor muscles. TMD patients showed involvement of the TA and EDL muscles, and in some patients also hamstring and posterior compartment muscles of the legs. Some patients showed asymmetry of muscle involvement. CONCLUSION: We conclude that muscle MRI examination proved to be very useful in the determination of the exact pattern of muscle involvement in WDM and TMD. Clinical testing using the Medical Research Council scale is not sensitive enough to establish the pattern of muscle involvement in focal muscle diseases.
