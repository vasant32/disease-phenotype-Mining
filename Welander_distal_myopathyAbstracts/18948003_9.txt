Mutations in C-terminal titin cause autosomal dominant tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) as reported previously. Samples from 25 new families and 25 sporadic new distal myopathy cases were screened for titin mutations. Three novel mutations were discovered in two families from Spain and two families from France. Two mutations, g.292998delT and g.293376delA lead to frameshift and premature stop codons in the second last and the last titin gene (TTN) exons, Mex5 and Mex6, respectively. The third was a nonsense mutation g.293379C>T (p.Q33396X) in Mex6. Patients with the upstream Mex5 mutation showed a more severe phenotype with earlier onset implying a genotype-phenotype correlation.
