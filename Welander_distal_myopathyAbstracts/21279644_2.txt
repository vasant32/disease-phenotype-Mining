Laing early-onset distal myopathy is a rare autosomal dominant myopathy and caused by mutations in the MYH7 gene, encoding the slow beta myosin heavy chain. We report the first molecularly verified Laing distal myopathy in a French family caused by a novel p.Glu1508del mutation in the MYH7 gene. Interestingly, we identified the identical mutation in an unrelated Norwegian family and, as a de novo mutation, in one sporadic Finnish patient. Described in detail are the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of 5 patients from the French family. The phenotype in the Finnish patient and the Norwegian patients is largely similar. This mutation causes a benign myopathy within the range of previously reported Laing myopathy phenotype variations. Onset of weakness in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles occurred in early childhood in all patients. Finger extensor and neck flexor weakness together with Achilles tendon retractions were other frequent findings. The independent recurrence of the identical mutation without any founder background may reflect a mutational susceptibility of this residue, in accordance with some other MYH7 mutations previously reported. De novo mutations seem to be frequent in Laing distal myopathy. This is of clinical importance since a dominant family history is missing, which may confuse differential diagnostic efforts.
