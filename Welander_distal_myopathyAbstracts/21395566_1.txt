Laing myopathy is a distal myopathy caused by mutations in the tail of the slow beta-myosin heavy chain gene MYH7. A large cluster of patients belonging to different families, with Laing myopathy due to p.K1729del mutation, was found in the Safor region, Spain. The same mutation was previously reported in an American family with Italian ancestry. The possibility that p.K1729del in MYH7 might be a founder mutation in the Safor patients and the chance of a common origin with the Italian-American family mutation was investigated by haplotype analyses, mutation data origin estimation and historical inquiry. Our results show that the p.K1729del in MYH7 harboured by patients from the Safor indeed is a founder mutation. A common ancestral origin of this mutation in the Spanish and Italian families is also suggested because they all share a core SNP haplotype at locus MYH7. Data estimation yields the origin of the mutation in the Safor at the beginning of the XVII century, when the Moorish were spelt and the region was resettled with Italian families.
