The proband, a 17-year-old boy, was admitted to our department because of the difficulty in standing on heel. Physical examination revealed a marked weakness and atrophy of bilateral lower legs, especially anterior tibial muscles. Patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes were abolished. Marked hepatomegaly and moderate splenomegaly were noted on abdominal echogram and CT scanning. Serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, GOT and GPT were markedly increased. There were no abnormal findings in thyroid function, serum lipid analysis and serum lactate level after ischemic forearm exercise test. EMG of anterior tibial and calf muscles showed a mixture of myogenic and neurogenic patterns and biopsy specimen of calf muscle was compatible with a dystrophic change. Liver biopsy specimen revealed no noticeable change except a slight ballooning of hepatocytes in light microscopy. However, electron microscopic examination showed a marked increase of intracellular vesicles and enlarged smooth ER in which low-density, cotton-like materials were contained. In family study, both his father and paternal uncle were also affected with advanced scapuloperoneal-type myopathy associated with a marked elevation of serum creatine kinase and hepatomegaly. The disorder differs from Miyoshi's distal muscular dystrophy, which shows an early involvement of flexor muscles in lower extremities and is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait. Although the etiology of hepatomegaly in this case remains to be elucidated, the special findings on electron microscopic study imply the possibility of some unknown metabolic disorder involving both muscle and liver. This disease seems to be a new type of scapuloperoneal-type myopathy, probably having an autosomal-dominant inheritance.
