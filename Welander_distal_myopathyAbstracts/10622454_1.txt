A 27-year-old woman with Miyoshi's distal muscular dystrophy devised a unique form of standing up from a squatting position; She held her ankles with her hands to support the weight transfer, fixed the heels, extended the knees to elevate the hips, raised the upper half of the body, and finally stood up. This strategy illustrates the characteristic and specific distribution of the wasted muscle in this disease.
