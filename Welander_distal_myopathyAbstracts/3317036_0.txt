High AMP deaminase reactivity was detected in the rimmed vacuoles in skeletal muscles in adult onset acid maltase deficiency and distal myopathy with rimmed vacuole formation histochemically as well as immunohistochemically. Acid phosphatase activity was positive but myosin ATPase activity was negative in the vacuoles. AMP deaminase found in rimmed vacuoles does not seem to be associated with myosin but is possibly bound to lysosomes or other related organelles in accordance with the proliferation of autophagic vacuoles.
