Autosomal recessive progressive muscular dystrophies may be clinically subclassified into limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) and distal myopathy (DM), each clinical form being genetically heterogeneous. Genes for LGMD type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy (a form of DM) have been mapped to essentially the same region on chromosome 2p. We described recently a large inbred family with autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy in which the LGMD and the DM phenotypes were manifested in separate affected members, and we assigned the gene for this condition to the same locus as in LGMD2B and Miyoshi myopathy. Here we report extended haplotypes in this family generated from 15 markers located at the region of interest on chromosome 2p13. Key recombinants allowed us to reduce further the candidate region for this polymorphic condition and defined the loci D2S327 and D2S2111 as the most likely boundaries of the mutant gene.
