We review new evidence that there is a difference in the electrophysiologic features of fasciculation potentials from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) versus those with benign fasciculations. A report on the entity of fasciculation anxiety syndrome in clinicians is also covered. An interesting association between ALS with the C9ORF72 mutation and multiple sclerosis has been reported; ALS is more severe in this setting. The genetic etiology of Welander distal myopathy is now known, and genetic predispositions for ambulatory loss in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and epilepsy were recently reported. Several recent articles on myasthenia gravis (MG) provide updates on the incidence of late-onset MG, genetic risk factors for MG development, and the complications of central versus peripheral access for plasma exchange. Last, several relatively recent articles address prevention and risk of developing paclitaxel-induced neuropathy.
