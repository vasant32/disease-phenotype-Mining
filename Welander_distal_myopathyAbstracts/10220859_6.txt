The distal myopathies are clinically, pathologically and genetically heterogenous. Thus far, seven types of distal myopathy have been linked to four chromosome loci. We recently examined four affected members from three generations of an autosomal dominant distal myopathy kindred. A muscle biopsy was performed on the index case. Muscle histopathology showed non-specific myopathic findings including increased variation in fiber size and increased internalized nuclei. No abnormal inclusions or vacuoles were present. Microsatellite markers for the four distal myopathy loci on chromosomes 2, 9 and 14 were studied on affected and several unaffected family members. Affected patients developed distal weakness in anterior foreleg muscles followed by progressive distal upper and proximal lower extremity involvement. Chromosome 2, 9 and 14 regional markers were informative and demonstrated recombinations with affected individuals in the pedigree. The resulting LOD scores obtained from the multipoint analyses gave no evidence of positive linkage to any of the regions and positively excluded (LOD score less than -2) all, or virtually all, of the candidate regions examined. This autosomal dominant distal myopathy family does not show evidence of linkage to any of the known distal myopathy loci, suggesting the existence of at least one more distal myopathy locus. Furthermore, the clinical and pathological features appear distinct from other previously described but genetically-undetermined autosomal dominant distal myopathies.
