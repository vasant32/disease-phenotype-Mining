 DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Laing distal myopathy is characterized by early-onset weakness (usually before age 5 years) that initially involves the dorsiflexors of the ankles and great toes and then the finger extensors, especially those of the third and fourth fingers. Weakness of the neck flexors is seen in all affected individuals and mild facial weakness is often present. After distal weakness has been present for more than ten years, mild proximal weakness is observed. Life expectancy is normal.  DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis relies on clinical findings and molecular genetic testing. Serum creatine kinase concentration is usually normal; muscle histology is not diagnostic. Molecular genetic testing of MYH7, the only gene known to be associated with Laing distal myopathy, is available on a clinical basis. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Physiotherapy to prevent or treat tightening of the tendo Achillis is helpful. In more advanced cases, lightweight splinting of the ankle (e.g., with an ankle-foot orthosis) can be useful.  Surveillance: annual neurologic examination; electrocardiogram and echocardiogram performed at the time of initial evaluation should be repeated if symptoms of cardiac insufficiency occur. GENETIC COUNSELING: Laing distal myopathy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. More than 90% of affected individuals have an affected parent: de novo mutations account for fewer than 10% of cases. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for families in which the disease-causing mutation has been identified.
