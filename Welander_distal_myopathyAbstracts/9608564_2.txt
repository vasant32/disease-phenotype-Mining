Welander distal myopathy (WDM) is an autosomal dominant disorder with late onset predominantly affecting distal extensor muscles of the hands and the feet. The disorder is considered as the most common of the distal myopathies but is almost only seen in Sweden and some parts of Finland. The finding of rimmed vacuoles in muscle biopsies from patients with moderate and severe symptoms constitutes one similarity with hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) sparing the quadriceps as described by Argov and Yarom [Argov Z, Yarom R. J Neurol Sci 1984;64:33-43]. The question has been raised whether some of the different forms of distal myopathy might be allelic. In previous reports the gene defects for HIBM and autosomal recessive hereditary distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) have been mapped to chromosome 9pl-q1. The Finnish tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) that displays similar histopathological findings has recently been linked to chromosome 2q. We have investigated the regions of interest with dispersed microsatellite markers in four well-described pedigrees, and this study now excludes the regions on chromosome 9pl-q1 and 2q from linkage to WDM both by haplotype analysis and linkage analysis with the MLINK program. WDM, showing morphological similarities with HIBM, is clearly separated from the disorders mapped to chromosomes 9 and 2 on clinical and genetical grounds.
