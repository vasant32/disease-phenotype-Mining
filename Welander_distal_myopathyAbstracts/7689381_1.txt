In seven patients with long-standing and six patients with early symptoms of Welander distal myopathy (WDM), monoclonal antibodies directed against such cytoskeletal proteins as dystrophin, spectrin and desmin and against Leu-19, a myoblast and satellite cell related antigen, were applied to muscle biopsies from the anterior tibial and soleus muscles. In addition, ultrastructural studies were carried out on biopsies from the soleus muscle. In muscle fibres from patients with early symptoms there was normal immunostaining for dystrophin, spectrin, desmin and Leu-19. In the patients with long-standing symptoms, there was also a normal expression of dystrophin, and a normal staining for spectrin and desmin was found in normal sized muscle fibres. Occasionally normal sized muscle fibres showed staining for Leu-19. Increased staining for spectrin and desmin and a strong Leu-19 staining was seen in normal sized muscle fibres with rimmed vacuoles and in atrophic fibres. Increased staining for spectrin, desmin and Leu-19 has been described in denervated muscle fibres and, thus, the present findings may support earlier findings of a neurogenic component in Welander distal myopathy. In the soleus muscle, ultrastructural muscle fibre abnormalities conformed to those in the anterior tibial muscle. Many rimmed vacuoles were observed which corresponded, at the ultrastructural level, to autophagic vacuoles. Intranuclear and cytoplasmic filamentous inclusions of the same shape and diameter as in inclusion body myositis were observed.
