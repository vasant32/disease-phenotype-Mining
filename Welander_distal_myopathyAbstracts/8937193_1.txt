Immunostaining of Bcl-2 protein which represses apoptosis was performed on 178 biopsied human pathologic muscles and 10 control muscles by the ABC method using two monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibodies. Bcl-2 in control muscles was positive mainly in nuclear membrane and cytoplasm in type 2 fibers (especially type 2B fibers), and negative in type 1 fibers. In myopathies, it was not expressed in type 2C (regenerating) fibers, and its expression in atrophic fibers such as forming pyknotic nuclear clumps was strong. In inflammatory myopathies, expression was observed in infiltrating lymphocytes, and especially in dermatomyositis in atrophic fibers facing perimysium. In mitochondrial myopathies, the positivity was observed only in type 2 ragged-red fibers. In muscles of neurogenic disorders, both small angulated fibers and atrophic grouped fibers were strongly positive. Western blot analysis using anti-Bcl-2 antibody showed a single band at 26 kDa in control and diseased skeletal muscles. Compared to immunostaining of Fas antigen in serial sections, both Bcl-2 and Fas were expressed in same atrophic fibers in distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles. In myotonic dystrophy, they were often expressed in type 2 fibers containing internal nucleus. In carriers of Duchenne dystrophy, Fas-positive but Bcl-2 negative fibers were observed in same dystrophin-negative fibers. In conclusion, expression of Bcl-2 in skeletal muscles might suggest that Bcl-2 plays a role on surviving muscle fibers.
