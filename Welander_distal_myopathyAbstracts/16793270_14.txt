Mutations in titin are well known cause of late onset autosomal dominant distal myopathy. Mutations in another sarcomeric protein, myotilin, were first identified in two families with dominant limb girdle muscular phenotype. Recently, however, myotilin mutations have been associated with more distal phenotypes in patients with late onset myofibrillar myopathy. We report here a multigenerational French family in which gene sequencing identified a S60F myotilin mutation in all patients with full penetrance despite very late onset. The family was originally reported as a distal myopathy but intrafamilial variability was remarkable with proximal or distal muscle weakness or both. Extended morphological characteristics of muscle biopsy findings in myotilinopathy indicate that immunohistochemistry may be important for selection of molecular genetic approach in myofibrillar myopathy.
