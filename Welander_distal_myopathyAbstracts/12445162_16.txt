Dysferlin deficiency is being increasingly recognized in limb-girdle dystrophy and distal myopathy but its role in the development of muscle pathology is still poorly understood. For this purpose, 26 muscle biopsies from 25 dysferlinopathy patients were analysed by routine histochemistry and by immunohistochemistry with eight different antibodies, and scored for inflammatory response and type of cell infiltrate, fibre degeneration and regeneration, fibre type composition and severity of histopathological changes. In cases with an advanced-stage dystrophic pattern we observed type 1 fibre predominance exceeding 80%, suggesting a selective loss of type 2 fibres or a conversion process. The extent of muscle fibre regeneration and degeneration in dysferlinopathy was intermediate between sarcoglycanopathy and Duchenne dystrophy or myositis, suggesting a rather aggressive course of the disease. An increased inflammatory response was observed in the majority of our patients (16/26), who also showed an active dystrophic pattern. Type and localization of cellular infiltrates suggest that inflammatory reaction is secondary to necrosis. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules were overexpressed in dysferlinopathy, mainly in association with fibre phagocytosis and regeneration; their occasional expression in non-necrotic fibres might represent a marker of ongoing necrosis. Muscle inflammation might be triggered by the structurally altered membrane consequent to dysferlin defect.
