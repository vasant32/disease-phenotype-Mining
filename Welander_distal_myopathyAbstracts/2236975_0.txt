We report a case of a woman of Mexican origin with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OMD). This is the first OMD reported in Mexico. She was healthy until the age of 30, when she noticed slowly progressive ptosis and dysphagia. She developed dermatitis and polyneuritis which we attribute to a deficiency of nutrients due to her dysphagia. In contrast to most previous reported cases this patient had also a distal myopathy. It is recommended in this type of patients a strict dietary control in order to avoid complications. It is also recommended to perform biopsies of several muscles to complete the diagnosis and prognosis.
