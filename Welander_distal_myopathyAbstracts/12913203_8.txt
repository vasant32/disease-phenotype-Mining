The authors describe a family in which two individuals have clinical distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV). While the clinical and most of the pathologic features in these patients were compatible with a diagnosis of DMRV, the presence of inflammatory changes in the connective tissue between muscle fibers was not. Gene analysis revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in these individuals, characterized by V572L and I472T.
