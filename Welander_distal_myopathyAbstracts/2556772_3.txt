Inclusion body myositis is now a well-known disease but its incidence is underestimated. We report 12 cases with clinical heterogeneity. Three groups of patients could be described. The first one corresponded to asymmetrical muscle involvement and distribution with a slow clinical course (4 cases). The second was characterized by a polymyositis-like syndrome (3 cas), but steroid therapy was ineffective. The last group mimicked a chronic spinal muscular atrophy (4 cases). One patient showed a scapuloperoneal syndrome. Both myopathic and neurogenic EMG patterns were present in 6 patients; a neurogenic pattern was found in 4 cases and a myopathic pattern in 2 cases. In all patients, muscle biopsies showed rimmed vacuoles with eosinophilic inclusions. In 9 cases ultrastructural studies displayed abnormal filaments of 15-18 nm in diameter in the vacuoles. Intranuclear filaments were rarely observed. The significance of the filaments is unknown and their specificity is doubtful because they are present in other myopathies with rimmed vacuoles (some distal myopathies and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophies). Finally a rich inflammatory exudate was present in 8 patients only.
