Limb girdle muscular dystrophy, a chronic progressive muscular atrophic disease, leads to high sensitivity to depolarizing and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. We report the successful use of the sugammadex in a patient with limb girdle muscular dystrophy (dysferlinopathy, Miyoshi distal myopathy) to reverse rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. After neuromuscular recovery to a train-of-four ratio = 43%, we administered 3.2 mg x kg(-1) of sugammadex (200 mg) intravenously, reversing neuromuscular blockade to a train-of-four ratio = 95% within 3 min. Sugammadex can be used to reverse rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy.
