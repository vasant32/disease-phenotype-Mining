We report two brothers from a Japanese family with a late-onset distal myopathy characterized by rimmed vacuoles and dysferlin deficiency with no inflammatory infiltration and dystrophic changes in muscle biopsy. Mutations in the GNE, dysferlin, caveolin 3, emerin, and lamin A/C genes were excluded. We speculate that dysferlin is involved in the pathogenesis of the myopathy in these patients, which may represent a new disease entity presenting as a distal myopathy.
