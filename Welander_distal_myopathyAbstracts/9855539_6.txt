We report the first European tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) family outside the Finnish population. Clinical examination showed late onset distal leg myopathy similar to the description of TMD. A molecular genetic study was made owing to the very recent TMD linkage findings on chromosome 2q31. All five clinically affected patients segregated a specific haplotype for the locus, whereas two unaffected patients had different haplotype. The results of this family without Finnish ancestors show that TMD exists outside the Finnish population.
