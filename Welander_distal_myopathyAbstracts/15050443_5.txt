Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is characterized by progressive weakness and wasting of facial, shoulder-girdle and upper arm muscles. Despite of the characteristic clinical features, the diagnosis of FSHD is sometimes difficult because clinical symptoms are extremely variable including facial sparing type, limb-girdle type, and distal myopathy type. Most of the FSHD patients have a deletion in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q35 (FSHMD1A), however the linkage analysis in some families suggested genetic heterogeneity. In the present study, we identified 40 patients without a deletion in the 4q35 region (non-4q35del) among 200 Japanese patients who were clinically suspected to have FHSD. All non-4q35del patients had shoulder-girdle weakness and 75% also had facial weakness. Eight patients showed clinical features that were indistinguishable from FSHD, but two of them had Becker muscular dystrophy. FSHD is clinically, and most likely genetically, as well, variable. Other forms of muscular dystrophy can also mimic FSHD.
