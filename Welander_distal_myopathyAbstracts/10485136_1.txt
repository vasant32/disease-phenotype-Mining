A new progressive tremor disorder called Campus syndrome (CPS) was observed among the progeny of a normal boar of the Pietrain breed in Germany. Extensive backcross experiments indicate that CPS is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, and the founder boar, Campus, is believed to be a gonadal mosaic. A linkage analysis of 57 animals mapped the CPS gene to a region on porcine chromosome 7 flanked by the markers SW1418 and SW352, which is homologous to a part of human chromosome (HSA) 14. Human dominant distal myopathy type 1 (MPD1) has been mapped to the homologous region of HSA14. As the myopathological findings in MDP1 show striking similarities to CPS, this porcine disorder may serve as an animal model for MPD1.
