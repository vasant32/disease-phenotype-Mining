Oculopharyngodistal myopathy is a clinicopathologically distinct muscular disease. The underlying genetic defect has not been identified. We report here a 43-year old woman with asymmetric bilateral ptosis, dysphonia, swallowing difficulties, and weakness of the distal leg muscles. Serum creatine kinase was moderately increased. Electromyography revealed myopathic changes and myotonic discharges. Both cardiologic and pneumologic evaluation did not reveal abnormalities. Muscle computed tomography images showed adipose tissue replacement of abdominis rectus, lateral vastus, adductor magnus, and both the posterior and anterior compartment muscles below the knee, with prevalent involvement of medial gastrocnemius muscle. Muscle biopsy uncovered changes in fiber size and the presence of atrophic fibers with rimmed vacuoles of varying diameter, and core-like structures in type I fibers. Diagnosis was performed according to clinical and histopathologic findings, which were fully consistent with the other reported patients, and on the genetic exclusion of similar conditions such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy type 1 and multi-minicore disease associated to RYR1 mutations. Differential diagnosis with mitochondrial myopathies, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and distal myopathies was also considered. This is the first Italian case of oculopharyngodistal myopathy, further suggesting the worldwide distribution of this rare neuromuscular disorder.
