Mutations in the myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) can cause several distinct phenotypes depending on the location of the mutation: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (several exons), myosin storage myopathy (exon 37/39) or Laing distal myopathy (exons 32-36). Here, we describe a unique combination of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic distal myopathy in a family with a MYH7 Val606Met mutation (exon 16).
