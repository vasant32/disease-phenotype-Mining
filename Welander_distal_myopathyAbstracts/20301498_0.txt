 DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Udd distal myopathy is characterized by weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and inability to walk on the heels after age 35 years. Disease progression is slow and muscle weakness remains confined to the anterior tibial muscles. The long toe extensors become clinically involved after ten to 20 years, leading to foot drop and clumsiness when walking. In the mildest form, Udd distal myopathy can remain unnoticed even in the elderly.  DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: EMG shows profound myopathic changes in the anterior tibial muscle. CT or MRI confirm fatty degeneration of the anterior tibial muscles and also show large patchy lesions in other clinically unaffected muscles. Molecular genetic testing is clinically available for TTN, encoding the protein titin (TTN), which is the only gene known to be associated with Udd distal myopathy. All affected Finnish families have a founder mutation termed FINmaj, a unique 11-bp deletion/insertion mutation that changes four amino-acid residues in exon Mex6. Six other mutations have been identified in exons Mex5 and Mex6 in families from different European populations.  MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: orthoses for foot drop early in the disease course; tibial posterior tendon transposition to replace lost function of the anterior tibial muscle and long toe extensor muscles when foot drop is severe.  Surveillance: neurologic examination every four months to evaluate gait and strength. Agents/circumstances to avoid: heavy muscle force training of weak muscles.  GENETIC COUNSELING: Udd distal myopathy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with Udd distal myopathy have an affected parent. Each child of an individual with Udd distal myopathy has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal testing for Udd distal myopathy for pregnancies at increased risk may be available through laboratories offering custom prenatal diagnosis if the causative mutation in a family is known.
