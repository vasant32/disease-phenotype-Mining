Anoctaminopathy is a new muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the ANO5 gene. ANO5 mutations cause distal and proximal phenotypes. We report here a follow-up muscle MRI study on five patients affected by distal form of anoctaminopathy. T1 weighted scans showed subsequent involvement of gastrocnemius medialis and soleus, hip adductors, hamstrings, gastrocnemius lateralis and quadriceps muscles, and later on tensor fascia lata, gluteus minimus and biceps brachii muscles, respectively. The STIR weighted images showed in the early stages widely distributed hyperintense signals, myoedema, in the adductors, hamstrings, and quadriceps muscles, which at that time have normal T1 signals. All patients showed asymmetry of muscle involvement both clinically and on muscle imaging. The progression of muscle involvement was relatively slow. We conclude that the pattern of muscle involvement seen in patients with distal myopathy with anoctamin 5 mutations (MMD3) is typical and can thus be useful during the differential diagnosis process allowing for a more targeted molecular approach.
