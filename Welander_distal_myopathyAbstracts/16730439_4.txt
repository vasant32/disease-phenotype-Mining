Mutations in CAV3 gene encoding the protein caveolin-3 are associated with autosomal dominant limb girdle muscular dystrophy 1C, rippling muscle disease, hyperCKemia, distal myopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and rare autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy phenotypes. In a 57-year-old patient with asymmetric limb girdle weakness, we detected a novel homozygous intronic mutation (IVS1 + 2T > C) of the CAV3 gene. This is the first splicing mutation reported for CAV3. These findings add to the clinical and genetic variability of CAV3 mutations.
