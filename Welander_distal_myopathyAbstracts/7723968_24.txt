Miyoshi myopathy (MM) is a young-adult-onset, autosomal recessive distal muscular dystrophy initially affecting the plantar flexors. We analyzed 12 MM families, five with consanguineous marriage, for chromosomal linkage using polymorphic microsatellite DNA markers to map the MM gene. A significant lod score was obtained with the 2p12-14 locus D2S291 (Zmax = 15.3 at theta = 0). Two additional 2p12-14 markers, D2S286 (Z = 10.7 at theta = 0) and D2S292 (Z = 7.2 at theta = 0.05), also gave significant lod scores. These markers will be useful for diagnosis of symptomatic and presymptomatic patients, prenatal and carrier diagnosis of family members carrying MM, and ultimately identification of a gene responsible for MM.
