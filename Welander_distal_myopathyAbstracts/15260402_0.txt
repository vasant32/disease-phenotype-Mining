Spinal muscular atrophies (SMA) are clinically heterogenous group of motor system disorders characterised by progressive pure lower motor neuron involvement. The distal form of SMA is an extremely rare disorder, which presents in the adults and has a relatively slow progression with almost no effect on the patients' life-span. Differential diagnosis of this syndrome include other forms of neuromuscular disorders with peroneal muscular atrophy like hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN) and distal myopathies, which need exclusion before confirming this rare entity. We present a young male with this disorder and briefly discuss the theoretical aspects.
