Lobulated fibers have been observed in biopsies of 13 patients with various neuromuscular disorders including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (3), distal myopathy (2), scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy (2), congenital myopathy, Kugelberg-Welander syndrome, hypothyroidism, steroid myopathy, osteomalacia and systemic lupus erythematosus (on steroids). In all cases there were fibers characterised by small subsarcolemmal triangular aggregates or more diffuse collections extending into the interior of the muscle fiber. These were strongly reactive with oxidative enzymes, acid phosphatase, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Verhoeff-van Gieson (VVG) and also stained red with the Gomori trichrome technique. In 5 cases core-like fibers were also seen. Morphometric analysis of the NADH-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR) preparations in 11 cases showed atrophy of the lobulated fibers. Ultrastructural studies of lobulated fibers disclosed large peripheral mitochondrial aggregates and focal areas with Z-line streaming and disrupted myofibrils. We consider this structural change of the muscle fiber as a reflection of muscle cell disruption and suggest that they may progress from lobulated fibers to more atrophic core-like fibers.
