A distal myopathy characterised by an autosomal dominant inheritance, with clinical onset around the age of 60, early involvement of posterior leg and thigh muscles, and normal or slightly-elevated creatine kinase levels was identified in three members of a French kindred. Tibialis anterior muscles were involved only in the most severely-affected sibling. Histological features included large multiple nonrimmed vacuolation and focal intrasarcoplasmic masses which immunoreacted with the anti-desmin antibody. Cytoplasmic and intranuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions were observed by electron microscopy. The condition of this familial syndrome is discussed in relation to previously-identified autosomal dominant distal myopathies and inclusion body myopathies.
