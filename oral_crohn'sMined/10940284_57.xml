<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> of the mouth or perineum is more common in young people, and notably resistant to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is increasing evidence that topical therapy with tacrolimus (FK506) may be effective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin diseases</z:e> resistant to cyclosporin because of its high uptake in inflamed skin and subsequent reduction in keratinocyte chemokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tacrolimus ointment was made up inhouse from the intravenous or oral formulation and suspended in appropriate vehicles for perioral or perianal administration at an initial concentration of 0.5 mg/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was administered open label to eight children (aged 5-18 years) with treatment resistant oral (three patients) and/or ulcerating perineal (six patients) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Marked improvement was seen in 7/8 patients within six weeks and healing within 1-6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One child with gross perineal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e> showed little response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the responders showed rebound worsening when tacrolimus was stopped or the dosage reduced rapidly, and one of these eventually required proctectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Slower weaning of drug concentration has been successful in 6/8 patients, with four receiving intermittent treatment and two on regular reduced dosage (0.1-0.3 mg/g) with follow up times of six months to 3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of tacrolimus were undetectable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Topical tacrolimus at low concentrations (0.5 mg/g) shows promise in the management of childhood perineal and oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, with no evidence of significant systemic absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, rapid weaning or abrupt cessation of therapy may cause rebound worsening of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further controlled studies are required to assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment </plain></SENT>
