<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> has long been suspected to have a mycobacterial cause, possible mycobacterial involvement in orofacial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> (OFG) and oral lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> has not yet been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: As the slow growing Mycobacterium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> has been implicated in the aetiology of intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, the potential involvement of this mycobacterial species in OFG and oral lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: To attempt detection of the organism in OFG and oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissue samples, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used on archival formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded oral tissue sections from 30 patients with OFG, seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The PCR assay used was based on primers targeting the 5' region of the multicopy IS900 DNA insertion element of the M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to achieve maximum sensitivity, two rounds of PCR were carried out and amplicons confirmed by Southern blot hybridisation to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi> labelled IS900 DNA probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the OFG and oral lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> samples were positive for M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were also negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that M <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> may not be a major aetiological agent in OFG or oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> lesions, although the use of paraffin wax embedded tissue as opposed to fresh tissue as a sample source could underestimate the true prevalence of the organism </plain></SENT>
