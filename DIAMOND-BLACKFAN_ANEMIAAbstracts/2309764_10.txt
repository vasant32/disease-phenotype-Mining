Congenital hypoplastic (Diamond-Blackfan) anemia is a rare macrocytic anemia, generally presenting during infancy or childhood. The condition usually occurs sporadically or in a pattern consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, although autosomal dominant transmission has been proposed in some kindreds. We report the largest known kindred of congenital hypoplastic anemia, with at least 7 affected individuals over 3 generations, and propose that studies of this kindred may be useful for identifying the mechanism by which their genetic abnormality results in congenital hypoplastic anemia. Erythropoietic investigations on relatives show no inhibitors of erythropoiesis in serum, T-lymphocytes, or macrophages. Their erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E and BFU-E) were generally quantitatively normal, and were capable of rapid proliferation, as judged by cell-cycle shortening. However, their erythroid progenitors displayed a relative insensitivity to recombinant erythropoietin, and produced relatively few normoblasts per erythroid progenitor cell. We propose that these and subsequent studies may be helpful in selecting candidate genes responsible for the molecular defect in this kindred.
