Mutations in ribosomal proteins RPS19, RPS24 and RPS17 have been reported in Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), an autosomal dominant disease characterised by pure red cell aplasia. DBA is the prototype of ribosomapathies: a protein synthesis defect in a tissue with a high cellular turnover is considered the cause of the erythroid progenitor failure. We have created the Diamond-Blackfan Anemia mutation database to curate and record DBA gene mutations, together with their functional consequences and clinical phenotypes. This locus-specific resource is open to future submissions and is available online (http://www.dbagenes.unito.it). It is founded on the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) system and includes data from sequence and structure analysis tools, genomic database resources and published reports. It lists all identified variants and background genomic information. Phenotypic data are accessed by selecting a particular mutation. The database includes 219 unique variants of which 86 are disease-causing mutations. The database will be supplemented with other DBA genes as soon as they are reported and their mutations are identified and it should be of assistance to clinicians and investigators involved in DBA research and care.
