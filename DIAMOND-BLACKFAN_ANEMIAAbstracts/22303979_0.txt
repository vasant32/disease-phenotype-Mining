Iron overload is a major toxicity of chronic transfusions. Myocardial iron overload is associated with cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac and liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 14 chronically transfused sickle cell disease (SCD) and non-sickle cell disease (non-SCD) patients seen at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital from 1 January 2000 to 10 March 2010. Retrospective review was conducted to assess cardiac T2*, liver T2*, ventricular dimensions and function, echocardiogram, length of transfusion, hemoglobin, and ferritin measurements. Ten patients had SCD and 4 had non-SCD, including α-thalassemia, β-thalassemia, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Cardiac T2* was normal in all SCD patients (mean 39 ± 12 ms), but abnormal in 3 of 4 non-SCD patients (mean 11.8 ± 2.4 ms). Liver T2* was similar between SCD (mean 6.2 ± 1.6 ms) and non-SCD patients (mean 5.9 ± 1.9 ms), and did not correlate with serum ferritin. Comparing SCD and non-SCD patients with similar transfusion duration, SCD patients had normal cardiac T2* and non-SCD patients had abnormal cardiac T2*. No patients had cardiomyopathy, but ventricular dilatation was common among SCD patients. Chronically transfused pediatric SCD patients are relatively spared of myocardial iron overload, which is unlikely to be due to lower total body iron burden in SCD patients than non-SCD patients.
