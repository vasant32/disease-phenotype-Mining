Ten healthy donors and four patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) have been investigated for granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) production by bone marrow-enriched fibroblasts (BMEF) in a highly sensitive biological assay on growth factor-dependent M-07e cells. M-07e cells detected active soluble kit-ligand from normal bone marrow fibroblasts as well as from DBA BMEF which produce constitutively significant amounts of SCF. Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) induced a significant increase of soluble SCF from both normal and DBA BMEF. GM-CSF was undetectable in unstimulated cultures, while its production by bone marrow microenvironmental cells was documented for both normal and DBA patients after IL-1 beta stimulation in vitro.
