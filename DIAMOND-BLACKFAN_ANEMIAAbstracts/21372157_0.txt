In this issue of Blood, Dutt and colleagues address the selective effect of ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency on erythroid development observed in congenital Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) and acquired 5q-syndrome. Their findings reveal a selective induction of p53 in the erythroid lineage in response to reduced expression of ribosomal proteins affected in these diseases. Moreover, the selective effect on erythropoiesis can be mimicked by activating p53 with the compound nutlin-3 and prevented by pifithrin-, an inhibitor of p53 activation.
