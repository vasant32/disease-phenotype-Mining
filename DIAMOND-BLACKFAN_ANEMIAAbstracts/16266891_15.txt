 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital disease characterized by defective erythroid progenitor maturation. Patients' bone marrow progenitor cells do not respond to erythropoietic growth factors, such as erythropoietin. Mutations in the gene encoding for ribosomal protein (RP) S19 account for 25% of cases of DBA. The link between defective erythropoiesis and RPS19 is still unclear. Two not mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed: altered protein synthesis and loss of unknown extraribosomal functions. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used yeast two-hybrid screening and a human liver cDNA library obtained at 19-24 weeks of gestation, when hepatic erythropoiesis is efficient, to search for proteins interacting with RPS19. RESULTS: We found that RPS19 binds PIM-1, an ubiquitous serine-threonine kinase whose expression can be induced in erythropoietic cells by several growth factors, such as erythropoietin. The PIM-1/RPS19 interaction was demonstrated both in vitro and in living cells and led to phosphorylation of RPS19 in an in vitro kinase assay. We also showed that in human 293T cells PIM-1 interacts with ribosomes and may be involved in translational control. Three DBA-associated RPS19 mutations alter the binding between RPS19 and PIM-1. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: A link between erythropoietic growth factor signaling and RPS19 has been identified for the first time.
