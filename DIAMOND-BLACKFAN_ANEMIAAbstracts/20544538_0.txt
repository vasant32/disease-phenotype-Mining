Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a rare metabolic disease causing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). An assay to determine ADA activity in dried blood spots was developed using reversed-phase HPLC. The assay was linear with reaction times up to at least 4 hours, and protein concentrations up to at least 2.2 mg/ml. The intra-assay CV and the inter-assay CV for the complete assay was 3.5 and 8.4%, respectively. The ADA activity in a control blood spot, stored at 4 degrees C, remained stable for at least one year. Only a slightly decreased ADA activity (35 +/- 13 nmol/mg/h, n = 4) was observed in heterozygotes for a c.704G > A mutation in the ADA gene when compared to that observed in controls (41 +/- 13 nmol/mg/h, n = 108). In addition, increased ADA activity as found in a rare form of congenital anemia can be assessed, as observed in a bloodspot from a patient diagnosed with Diamond Blackfan anemia (ADA activity 150 nmol/mg/h).
