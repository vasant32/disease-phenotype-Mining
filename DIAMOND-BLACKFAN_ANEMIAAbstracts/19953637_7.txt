Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by pure red cell aplasia, various congenital anomalies, and cancer predisposition. We report a novel mutation in the RPS17 gene in a Korean patient with DBA. The mutation occurred in the translation initiation codon, changing Atg to Gtg (c.1A>G), thus disrupting the natural start of the RPS17 protein biosynthesis. This is the third case of DBA from a RPS17 mutation in the literature and is the second case of a RPS17 mutation in the translation initiation codon, following c.2T>G.
