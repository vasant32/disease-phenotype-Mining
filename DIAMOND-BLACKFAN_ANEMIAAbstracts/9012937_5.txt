A 4-year-old boy with Diamond-Blackfan anemia and a history of multiple transfusions underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation from his HLA-identical female sibling born by vaginal delivery at 38 weeks. The patient was prepared with busulfan, cyclophosphamide and antilymphocyte globulin. Methotrexate and cyclosporin A were given for the prophylaxis of GVHD. Regimen-related toxicity was not observed and successful engraftment occurred, including the erythroid series. No evidence of acute or chronic GVHD has been observed for 14 months after transplantation. This is the first case of successful umbilical cord blood transplantation to a patient with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.
