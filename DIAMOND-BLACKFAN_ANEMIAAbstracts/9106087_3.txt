OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of hearing loss in a population of 75 adult (19-68 years old) transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia major, sickle cell disease, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and various other hematologic disorders treated with regular transfusion schedules. Ninety-three percent (70/75) of patients had a history of long-term subcutaneous or intravenous desferrioxamine therapy. METHODS: The patients underwent routine otolaryngologic history and physical examination, along with standard pure-tone audiometry at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz, with hearing loss defined as 25 dB or greater at one or more frequencies. RESULTS: Hearing loss was present in 57% (43/75) of patients. More importantly, hearing loss attributable to desferrioxamine ototoxicity was present in 29% (22/75) of patients. Sixteen patients treated previously with desferrioxamine were switched to the experimental oral chelating agent, L1. Eight of these 16 patients had hearing loss attributable to desferrioxamine, with 5 of these patients worsening with the experimental oral chelating agent L1. Seventy-nine percent (59/75) of patients were thalassemic. Fifty-four percent (33/59) of these thalassemic patients had hearing loss. However, 35% (21/59) of the thalassemic patients had hearing loss attributable to desferrioxamine ototoxicity. All thalassemic patients with desferrioxamine ototoxicity had high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, with 33% (7/21) having a notch at 6 kHz. In addition, 5% (1/21) had notching at 3 khz. Few of the hearing losses were disabling. CONCLUSIONS: Management of these patients requires proper dosing of desferrioxamine and transfusion therapy, along with regular monitoring of body iron burden and hemoglobin. In addition, regular otolaryngologic and audiometric follow-up with special care to include the frequencies of 3 and 6 kHz may help recognize and prevent permanent ototoxicity.
