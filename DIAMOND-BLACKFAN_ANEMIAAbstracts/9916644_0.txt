From January 1992 to December 1997, 21 consecutive patients (14 SAA, 3 SCID, 1 Fanconi anemia, 1 Diamond-Blackfan anemia, 1 mucolipidosis and 1 mucopolysaccharidosis type I.) were transplanted (16 HLA-id. family, 2 MUD and 3 haploidentical family donors) in a single center. The median follow up period is 41 months (range 7-76). The probability of 3.5 year overall disease free survival is 14/21 (67%), the transplant related mortality is 4/21 (19%). All the SCID patients are alive and disease free. 3 SAA patients had signs of fungal infection prior to transplant. They died in spite of intensive antifungal treatment resulting reduced DFS for SAA to 71%. Two patients with lysosomal storage disorders (mucolipidosis and MPS I.) rejected the haploidentical T-cell depleted graft 1 and 11 months after transplant, respectively. In 2 cases non-engraftment occured, both patients were retransplanted successfully.
