Chronic refractory anemia associated with congenital hypoplastic anemia (CHA, Blackfan-Diamond syndrome) and with the 5q-syndrome may require chronic transfusion therapy to sustain life. Hemosiderosis and death from chronic iron overload may result from such a program. The effect of subcutaneous (SC) deferoxamine (DF) and supplemental oral vitamin C (vit. C) on urinary iron excretion was studied in two patients with congenital hypoplastic anemia and one patient with 5q-syndrome. In the two patients with CHA, urinary iron excretion in response to DF given SC over 24 hours was comparable to the results following intravenous (I.V.) administration. Both of these cases had low levels of plasma ascorbate on initial evaluation and excreted more iron in response to two different doses of DF after they had received supplemental vit C and their stores were repleted. Significant iron excretion occurred in all three patients for 12 hours during the SC infusion of DF and for 12 hours after the end of the infusion. In all three patients, increasing the dose of DF up to 3-4 g given SC over 12 hours resulted in a linear increase in iron excretion. Once normal body stores of ascorbate were achieved by oral supplementation, increasing doses of vit C did not appear to cause a further increment in iron excretion. DF administered by a slow SC infusion appears to be an effective approach to iron overload in patients with refractory anemia and hemosiderosis secondary to chronic transfusions. Only small amounts of supplemental vit. C necessary to sustain adequate body stores are required for optimal iron excretion.
