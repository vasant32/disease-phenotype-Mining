Comparisons of erythrocyte and plasma phospholipids made among adults, newborns, and a female patient with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA) revealed some indications for the continual existence of a neonatal phospholipid distribution in DBA. The relative percentage of phospholipids in erythrocytes and plasma were similar in newborns and in the female patient. The other peculiarities characteristic of newborns, such as deviations in the absolute phospholipid content, typical fatty acid patterns of phospholipids, could not be identified in DBA.
