Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a constitutional disease characterized by a specific maturation defect in cells of erythroid lineage. We have assembled a registry of 229 DBA patients, which includes 151 patients from France, 70 from Germany, and eight from other countries. Presence of malformations was significantly and independently associated with familial history of DBA, short stature at presentation (before any steroid therapy), and absence of hypotrophy at birth. Two hundred twenty-two patients were available for long-term follow-up analysis (median, 111.5 mo). Of these individuals, 62.6% initially responded to steroid therapy. Initial steroid responsiveness was found significantly and independently associated with older age at presentation, familial history of DBA, and a normal platelet count at the time of diagnosis. Severe evolution of the disease (transfusion dependence or death) was significantly and independently associated with a younger age at presentation and with a history of premature birth. In contrast, patients with a familial history of the disease experienced a better outcome. Outcome analysis revealed the benefit of reassessing steroid responsiveness during the course of the disease for initially nonresponsive patients. Bone marrow transplantation was successful in 11/13 cases; HLA typing of probands and siblings should be performed early if patients are transfusion dependent, and cord blood should be preserved. Incidence of DBA (assessed for France over a 13-y period) is 7.3 cases per million live births without effect of seasonality on incidence of the disease or on malformative status. Similarly, no parental imprinting effect or anticipation phenomenon could be documented in families with dominant inheritance.
