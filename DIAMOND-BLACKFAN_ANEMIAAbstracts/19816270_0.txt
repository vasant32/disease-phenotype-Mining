Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital erythroid aplasia or hypoplasia presenting in infancy as a macrocytic anemia. It has been linked to a gene defect resulting in the absence of specific ribosomal proteins that enable erythroid maturation. Treacher Collins syndrome is also associated with defective ribosomal biogenesis. Fifty percent of patients with DBA also present with additional physical abnormalities including growth delay, craniofacial abnormalities, upper limp abnormalities, cardiac defects, urogenital malformations, and cleft palate. Upper airway obstruction may be a complication from craniofacial disorders and may be responsible for life-threatening sleep apnea that may result in pneumonia or respiratory failure. This report is of a patient with DBA who presented at birth with respiratory distress secondary to tongue-based obstruction of the airway due to mandibulofacial dysostosis leading to need for intubation. In an effort to avoid a tracheostomy, the patient underwent bilateral internal mandibular osteodistraction on day 4 of life with a latency period of 0 days and a distraction at a rate of 2 mm/d for 10 days until a class 3 dental occlusion existed with 5 mm of overcorrection. In addition, the patient was born with choanal atresia that was repaired at day 30 of life. After completion of the mandibular distraction, the patient has avoided tracheostomy and is now 6 months of age. Recent polysomnogram has demonstrated no significant apnea or hypopnea.
