A 25 year old patient with congenital hypoplastic anemia (Black-fan-Diamond syndrome) is described. This patient was hepatitis-antigen negative, had not received androgens and had a hepatoma develop in a transfusional hemochromatotic liver. Since androgens have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, the use of androgenic steroids for other than life-threatening symptoms in this disease should be avoided.
