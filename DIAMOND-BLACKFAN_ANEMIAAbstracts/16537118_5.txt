We reviewed 64 pregnancies in 26 women with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) included in the French and German DBA registries. Complications were seen in 42 pregnancies (66%) and included abortion, pre-eclampsia, in utero fetal death, intrauterine growth retardation, retroplacental hematoma, pre-term delivery and fetal malformations. Of the 34 children (53%) born alive, 13 had DBA. No correlations were found between pregnancy outcome and features of either maternal or child DBA. Pregnancies in DBA-affected women are at high risk, especially for complications likely to be of vascular-placental origin. Careful monitoring with prevention of severe anemia and early introduction of aspirin is suggested.
