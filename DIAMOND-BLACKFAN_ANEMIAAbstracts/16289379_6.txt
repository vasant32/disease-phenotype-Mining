The gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is mutated in approximately 25% of patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), which is a rare congenital erythroblastopenia. DBA patients have a variety of clinical characteristics, and the role of the RPS19 gene in the pathogenesis of the disease is presently unknown. To investigate a possible role for RPS19 in erythropoiesis, we looked for proteins associated with mouse RPS19 using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified a novel protein, which we named S19 binding protein (S19BP). The deduced amino acid sequence of S19BP derived from cDNA defines a calculated mass of 15,849 and an isoelectric point of 11.3. No known functional motifs were found in S19BP except a short polylysine tract embedded in a putative nucleolar localization signal. Immunolocalization experiments revealed that S19BP was highly concentrated in nucleoli after 6 h of transfection in Cos-7 cells. S19BP was expressed ubiquitously at a basal level but a significantly high level of expression was observed in some tissues.
