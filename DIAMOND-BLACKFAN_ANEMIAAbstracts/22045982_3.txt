Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital BM failure syndrome characterized by hypoproliferative anemia, associated physical abnormalities, and a predisposition to cancer. Perturbations of the ribosome appear to be critically important in DBA; alterations in 9 different ribosomal protein genes have been identified in multiple unrelated families, along with rarer abnormalities of additional ribosomal proteins. However, at present, only 50% to 60% of patients have an identifiable genetic lesion by ribosomal protein gene sequencing. Using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism array to evaluate for regions of recurrent copy variation, we identified deletions at known DBA-related ribosomal protein gene loci in 17% (9 of 51) of patients without an identifiable mutation, including RPS19, RPS17, RPS26, and RPL35A. No recurrent regions of copy variation at novel loci were identified. Because RPS17 is a duplicated gene with 4 copies in a diploid genome, we demonstrate haploinsufficient RPS17 expression and a small subunit ribosomal RNA processing abnormality in patients harboring RPS17 deletions. Finally, we report the novel identification of variable mosaic loss involving known DBA gene regions in 3 patients from 2 kindreds. These data suggest that ribosomal protein gene deletion is more common than previously suspected and should be considered a component of the initial genetic evaluation in cases of suspected DBA.
