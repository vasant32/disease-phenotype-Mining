Iron chelation therapy must be associated with the regular blood transfusions required for thalassaemia and other chronic anemias. We report here a study concerning 4 groups of patients, aged 6 to 28, regularly transfused at Necker Enfants-Malades hospital: a) 20 with thalassaemia major; b) 6 with thalassaemia intermedia; c) 2 with sickle cell disease and d) 2 with Blackfan-Diamond syndrome. The transfusion regimen consisting of monthly or quarterly transfusions varied as a function of the groups. Desferal was used in all patients. The dosage and the route of administration (IV, IM, SC) were adapted to the amount of iron transfused and to the nature of the disease. The serum ferritin level was considered as the indicator of the iron overload. Comparisons were established between the quantities of iron transfused, ferritin levels, and parameters such as dosage, route of administration and compliance to Desferal. During the period of study 3 patients died from cardiac failure due to transfusional hemosiderosis. Endocrine complications (diabetes 2 cases, hypocalcemia 3 cases, hypothyroidism 1 case and delayed puberty 7 cases) were observed. This high incidence of complications induced by post-transfusional iron overload has recently prompted us to improve the quality of chelation therapy through the use of the services of a specialized center where patients as well as their families can be trained more adequately in home care and self-treatment.
