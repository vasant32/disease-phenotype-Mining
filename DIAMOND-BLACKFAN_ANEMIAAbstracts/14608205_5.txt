After failing a trial of corticosteroid therapy, molecularly proven identical twins were treated for transfusion-dependent Diamond-Blackfan anemia with cyclosporine A, resulting in a robust erythropoietic response and a reversal of anemia. Clonogenic assays of marrow hematopoietic progenitors from both patients showed exuberant growth of BFU-E colonies but absent CFU-E. Clinically, the response has been sustained, and both patients have continued cyclosporine therapy and have been transfusion-independent for more than 27 months.
