Cord blood transplantation (CBT) has been increasingly used to treat patients with hematological diseases, but active immunizations for patients have not been described. Patients certainly need immunizations following CBT, since transplanted cord blood is naive. The authors previously reported successful hematopoietic reconstitution following cord blood transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling in a transfusion-dependent child with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. No graft-versus-host disease, either acute or chronic, has been observed so far. Here, the authors report that immunological recovery of the patient has been rapid shortly after CBT and immunization has been done successfully. Vaccines (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, rubella, measles, and BCG) were administered during 22-34 months post-transplant. Seroconversion to these vaccines was excellent without significant adverse effects. These results indicate that both toxoid and live vaccines have been safely administered in the patient who underwent related cord blood transplantation.
