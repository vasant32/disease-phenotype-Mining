We describe a mother and son with congenital hypoplastic anemia. The mother has apparently normal thumbs and forearms but her son has bilateral radial hypoplasia. They provide a further example of dominant inheritance of Diamond-Blackfan anemia/Aase syndrome and suggest that thumb and radial abnormalities are a component of this syndrome.
