Congenital red cell aplasia (Diamond-Blackfan anemia) is occasionally associated with hematologic defects other than a deficiency of red blood cell progenitors, but such alterations have not been well studied. The frequency and magnitude of abnormalities in platelet count and platelet function were therefore examined in 38 patients. Thrombocytosis was seen in 21 patients, and 12 had mild thrombocytopenia on at least one occasion. Elevated platelet counts were demonstrated repeatedly in nine children. The three patients with the lowest platelet counts also had leukopenia. Platelet aggregation was normal in all 16 patients in whom it was studied, and bleeding times were within the normal range in 14 of them. Bleeding signs and symptoms were not observed. It is concluded that thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia often occurs but that platelet function is normal in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.
