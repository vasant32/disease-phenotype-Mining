Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare disorder of erythrocyte production which is believed to have an autoimmune basis in most cases. Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is one type of congenital PRCA. Since PRCA has been reported to respond to intravenous gamma-globulin (IVGG) therapy, we administered IVGG to a 2 year old girl with DBA resistant to corticosteroids and observed slight therapeutic effect.
