A review of the published world experience with heart transplantation for iron overload cardiomyopathy (IOC) between 1967 and 2003 as well as review of unpublished cases from the database of the United Network for Organ Sharing since 1992, identified a total of 16 patients (14 men and 2 women). Mean age was 31 years (range, 14-63 years). IOC etiology was hemochromatosis in 11 patients (69%), thalassemia major in 4 (25%), and Diamond-Blackfan anemia in 1 (6%). The 30-day mortality was 12%. Three patients (19%) died within 1 year of the transplant, all of infectious complications. An additional patient died at 7.14 years (unknown cause). The actuarial Kaplan-Meier 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 81% for all 3 time intervals. The actuarial 10-year survival was 41%.
