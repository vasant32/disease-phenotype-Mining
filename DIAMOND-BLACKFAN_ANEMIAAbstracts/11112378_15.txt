Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital disease characterized by defective erythroid progenitor maturation and physical malformations. Most cases are sporadic, but dominant or, more rarely, recessive inheritance is observed in 10% of patients. Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein (RP) S19 have recently been found in 25% of patients with either the dominant or the sporadic form. DBA is the first human disease due to mutations in a ribosomal structural protein. Families unlinked to this locus have also been reported. In an investigation of 23 individuals, we identified eight different mutations in 9 patients. These include five missense, one frameshift, one splice site defect, and one 4-bp insertion in the regulatory sequence. Seven mutations are new; one has so far been found in 8 patients and is a relatively common de novo event. Two mutations are predicted to generate a truncated protein. We also report the prevalence of RPS 19 mutations in the Italian DBA population, as shown by an analysis of 56 patients. No genotype-phenotype correlation was found between patients with the same mutation. The main clinical applications for molecular analysis are clinical diagnosis of patients with an incomplete form of DBA and testing of siblings of a patient with a severe form so as to avoid using those who carry a mutation and a silent phenotype as allogeneic stem cell donors.
