Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a congenital hypoproliferative anemia known to be associated with diverse physical anomalies affecting the thumb, craniofacial bones, urogenital system, and heart; prematurity; and fetal demise. We report the case of a 16-month-old boy with Diamond-Blackfan anemia noted to have decreased use of his right side since birth. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a large area of encephalomalacia in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Magnetic resonance angiography showed marked attenuation of the left middle cerebral artery, suggesting a remote thromboembolic event. The laboratory results were remarkable for a decreased hemogolobin of 9.5 g/dL and increased platelets of 591,000/microL. He was heterozygous for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene C677T mutation. An echocardiogram demonstrated a patent foramen ovale versus an atrial septal defect with left to right shunting. Perinatal stroke may be a rare complication of Diamond-Blackfan anemia in the setting of other risk factors.
