Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital pure red cell aplasia. Previous studies indicate that mutations of a gene on chromosome 19q13.2, which encodes a ribosomal protein, are responsible for 25% of cases. Recent investigations suggest both the presence of a second candidate region on chromosome 8p and non-19q, non-8p disease. In linkage analysis studies of 28 multiplex DBA families, we identified 8 families with disease linkage to chromosome 1q31. In 4 families, the disease linked exclusively to 1q31. Here, we report that the FLVCR gene on 1q31, which encodes a cytoplasmic heme exporter associated with red cell aplasia in cats, is not involved in DBA in these families.
