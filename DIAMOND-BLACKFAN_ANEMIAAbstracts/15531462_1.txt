In the study of the possible thrombopoietin (TPO)-c-Mpl pathway involvement in the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia, repeatedly increased serum TPO levels were identified in 7/14 patients and changes in c-mpl sequence in 3/14 patients. While elevated TPO levels can represent a compensatory mechanism for impaired erythropoiesis, c-Mpl mutations could influence the disease severity.
