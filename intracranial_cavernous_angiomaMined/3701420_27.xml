<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation was variable: 53.8% of patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 30.8% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 15.4% focal neurological signs, including one unusual case that presented as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263881" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cerebellopontine angle tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The computerized tomography (CT) scans were abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography was positive only when there was mass effect due to associated <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed in 12 cases with good results </plain></SENT>
