<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the cases are from our own series and 126 were collected from appropriately documented reports in the modern literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis indicated that, at the time of diagnosis, one-third of the patients (49 cases) were being evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, one-third (40 cases) for clinical evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and one-third (49 cases) for mass lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike the other two groups, the group presenting with clinical evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was distinguished by a dominant age at the time of diagnosis (41% were diagnosed during the 4th decade of life), by a high incidence of prior neurological evaluation (43%), by a higher rate of diagnosis at autopsy (28%) than at operation, and by the absence of microscopic calcification within the lesion </plain></SENT>
