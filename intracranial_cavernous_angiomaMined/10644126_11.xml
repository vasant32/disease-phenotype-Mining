<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyze the magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging features of familial cerebral cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> in non-Hispanic families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 1996 and June 1997, 51 non-Hispanic families with familial cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in 83 symptomatic subjects and 73 asymptomatic subjects were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spin-echo (SE) and gradient-echo (GRE) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging features of cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> were recorded and, in 91 subjects with both SE and GRE images, lesions were graded as type 1, 2, 3, or 4, according to a published classification scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging features were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, and sensitivities of SE and GRE images were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple lesions were more common than single lesions in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, with no difference in mean number of lesions between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More lesions were detected on GRE images than on SE images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 1 and type 2 lesions were more numerous in symptomatic than in asymptomatic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The numbers of types 2, 3, and 4 lesions increased with age in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The familial form of cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> is characterized by multiple lesions and by a correlation between lesion number and subject age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestation may be more closely related to the type of lesion than to the number of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GRE <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images are more sensitive than SE images for demonstration of cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
