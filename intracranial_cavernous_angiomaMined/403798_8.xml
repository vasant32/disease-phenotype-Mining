<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients who had intracranial cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> confirmed at surgery are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative recognition is greatly aided by a tendency to calcify, as identified both by skull films and more sensitively by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A well demarcated collection of rounded densities of CT scanning, showing mild contrast enhancement and no significant mass effect, should suggest the possibility of cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conventional angiography characteristically reveals a hypovascular appearance without abnormal arterial feeding vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On films of high technical quality, a subtle vascular stain, possibly associated with a few large draining veins, may be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is usually no mass effect unless there has been a previous episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> may manifest a pronounced increase in activity on radionuclide brain scanning </plain></SENT>
