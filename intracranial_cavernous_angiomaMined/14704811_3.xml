<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We report a case of congenital intracranial cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, which was initially found at a gestational age of 34 weeks in utero as a mass lesion associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After birth, the patient was treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> first by external drainage and then by ventricular peritoneal shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The natural course of the mass lesion was observed until the age of 8 months when the histopathological diagnosis confirmed the cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> after tissue was obtained by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scans repeated monthly during this period demonstrated that the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> continuously decreased in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> on serial CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histopathology revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of cavernous vessels with hyaloid changes in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The mechanisms of the decreasing size of the cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> have often been discussed in relation to spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present case suggests a mechanism in which the spontaneous formation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> might be the dominant factor for the decrease in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> formation may result from low perfusion due to the large size of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
