 BACKGROUND: EMR is commonly performed before radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for nodular dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE). OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of EMR before RFA for nodular BE with advanced neoplasia (high-grade dysplasia [HGD] or intramucosal carcinoma [IMC]). DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: University of North Carolina Hospitals, from 2006 to 2011. PATIENTS: 169 patients with BE with advanced neoplasia: 65 patients treated with EMR and RFA for nodular disease and 104 patients treated with RFA alone for nonnodular disease. INTERVENTIONS: EMR, RFA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy (complete eradication of dysplasia, complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia, total treatment sessions, RFA treatment sessions), safety (stricture formation, bleeding, and hospitalization). RESULTS: EMR followed by RFA achieved complete eradication of dysplasia and complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia in 94.0% and 88.0% of patients, respectively, compared with 82.7% and 77.6% of patients, respectively, in the RFA-only group (P = .06 and P = .13, respectively). The complication rates between the 2 groups were similar (7.7% vs 9.6%, P = .79). Strictures occurred in 4.6% of patients in the EMR-before-RFA group. compared with 7.7% of patients in the RFA-only group (P = .53). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study at a tertiary-care referral center. CONCLUSION: In patients treated with EMR before RFA for nodular BE with HGD or IMC, no differences in efficacy and safety outcomes were observed compared with RFA alone for nonnodular BE with HGD or IMC. EMR followed by RFA is safe and effective for patients with nodular BE and advanced neoplasia.
