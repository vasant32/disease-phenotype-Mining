We report herein a case of adenocarcinoma arising from short-segment Barrett's esophagus (SSBE) in a 36-year-old man. An elevated tumor was found at the esophagogastric junction, and a histological evaluation of the biopsy specimen led to a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. The tumor was found to be confined to the mucosa surrounding the SSBE, and endoscopic submucosal dissection was done without complications. Histological examination of the resected specimen showed that the adenocarcinoma had also invaded the muscularis mucosae and provided evidence of lymphovascular invasion. Additional surgical resection and regional lymph node dissection were therefore carried out; however, no lymph node metastasis was found. Adenocarcinoma arising from Barrett's mucosa is rare in young patients, especially in Japan, and this case is therefore particularly noteworthy.
