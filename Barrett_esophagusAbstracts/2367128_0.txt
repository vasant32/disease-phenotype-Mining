The case of a 6.5 years old boy, hospitalised because of recurrent vomiting, epigastrial, periumbilical abdominal pain, is reported. The contrast--medium swallow--x-ray examination showed no alteration, while during repeated continuous 24 hours pH monitoring of the distal esophagus, the pH values permanently were wound to remain under 4. By esophagoscopy, only moderate inflammatory signs could be detected. The long-lasting complaints and the results of pH monitoring indicated serial biopsy from the esophagus-wall. The histological finding showed gastric mucosa 2 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter, i.e. a Barrett syndrome. Upon the treatment administered according to the diagnosis, the complaints of the child considerably improved.
