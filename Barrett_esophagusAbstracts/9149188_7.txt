OBJECTIVES: Prospective evaluation of the prevalence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) within Barrett's esophagus and its association with gastric MALT, gastric MALT lymphoma, and H. pylori infection. METHODS: From Barrett's esophagus patients, a minimum of six gastric biopsies were obtained, in addition to Barrett's surveillance biopsies. Additional gastric biopsies were taken from any ulcer(s), nodule(s), polyp(s), or other lesions. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms without Barrett's esophagus served as controls. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-nine Barrett's patients were included in the study. One hundred and twenty-two of these patients had gastric biopsies for gastric MALT and H. pylori determination. H. pylori was noted in the stomach of 48 patients and within Barrett's mucosa in 14. Barrett's MALT was noted in seven cases, gastric MALT in 16, and gastric MALT lymphoma in two. None of the 101 control patients had esophageal MALT. Two of the seven patients with Barrett's MALT had gastric MALT. Barrett's MALT was associated with esophageal H. pylori in 57.1% cases and gastric H. pylori in 71.4%. The prevalence of gastric and esophageal H. pylori in patients with Barrett's MALT was significantly higher compared to patients with Barrett's without MALT (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.007, respectively). Barrett's MALT was very focal and its esophageal location variable. CONCLUSIONS: Barrett's MALT was associated with both esophageal and gastric H. pylori colonization. Esophageal MALT was associated with Barrett's esophagus. Gastric biopsy sampling is warranted in any patient with Barrett's MALT to detect gastric MALT and H. pylori, which, if found, should be eradicated.
