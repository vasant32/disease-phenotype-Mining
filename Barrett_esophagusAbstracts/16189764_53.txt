BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: High-resolution endoscopy (HRE) may improve the detection of early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. Indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (ICC) and narrow-band imaging (NBI) may be useful techniques to complement HRE. The aim of this study was to compare HRE-ICC with HRE-NBI for the detection of high-grade dysplasia or early cancer (HGD/EC) in patients with Barrett's esophagus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with Barrett's esophagus underwent HRE-ICC and HRE-NBI (separated by 6 - 8 weeks) in a randomized sequence. The two procedures were performed by two different endoscopists, who were blinded to the findings of the other examination. Targeted biopsies were taken from all detected lesions, followed by four-quadrant biopsies at 2-cm intervals. Biopsy evaluation was supervised by a single expert pathologist, who was blinded to the imaging technique used. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were diagnosed with HGD/EC. The sensitivity for HGD/EC was 93 % and 86 % for HRE-ICC and HRE-NBI, respectively. Targeted biopsies had a sensitivity of 79 % with HRE alone. HGD was diagnosed from random biopsies alone in only one patient. ICC and NBI detected a limited number of additional lesions occult to HRE, but these lesions did not alter the sensitivity for identifying patients with HGD/EC. CONCLUSIONS: In most patients with high-grade dysplasia or early cancer in Barrett's esophagus, subtle lesions can be identified with high-resolution endoscopy. Indigo carmine chromoendoscopy and narrow-band imaging are comparable as adjuncts to high-resolution endoscopy.
