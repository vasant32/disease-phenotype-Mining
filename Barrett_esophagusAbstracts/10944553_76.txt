BACKGROUND: Esophageal adenocarcinoma commonly arises from a precancerous condition, Barrett's esophagus, in which the normal squamous epithelium is replaced by a columnar cell-lined epithelium. Genetic alterations occurring in this process could serve as biomarkers for the risk of malignant progression, improve surveillance, and contribute to early diagnosis. We examined two potential biomarkers, cyclin D1 and p53, in a prospective cohort of Barrett's esophagus patients. METHODS: A total of 307 patients were enrolled in an endoscopic surveillance cohort, and esophageal biopsy specimens were collected at each endoscopy. Incident cases of adenocarcinoma were matched to control patients within the cohort by duration of follow-up, age, sex, and length of columnar cell-lined epithelium at recruitment. Biopsy specimens were analyzed for cyclin D1 and p53 protein levels by immunohistochemistry. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 12 cases of adenocarcinoma occurred within the follow-up period, and tumor biopsy specimens from 11 cases stained positive for cyclin D1. Biopsy specimens from eight of these patients taken at recruitment also stained positive for cyclin D1. A case-control analysis of biopsy specimens obtained at recruitment revealed a statistically significantly increased risk of progression to adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus patients whose biopsy specimens were cyclin D1 positive (odds ratio [OR] = 6. 85; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.57-29.91; P =.0106) but not in patients whose biopsy specimens were p53 positive (OR = 2.99; 95% CI = 0.57-15.76; P =.197). CONCLUSIONS: Cyclin D1-positive staining could be a useful biomarker in identifying Barrett's esophagus patients at high risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given the complexity of genetic alterations in the natural history of this cancer, additional biomarkers will be required to increase the sensitivity and specificity of molecular diagnosis.
