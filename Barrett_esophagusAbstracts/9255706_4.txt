A delta 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) bioadhesive gel has been developed and evaluated in an in-vivo mouse model for photodynamic treatment of gastric cancer or Barrett's oesophagus. Four gels were tested: noveon AA-1, keltrol T, lutrol and blanose. An initial in-vitro study of gel adhesion showed that noveon and keltrol had longer polyethylene transit times than lutrol and blanose. In-vivo assays indicated that protoporphyrin IX was synthesized by gastric mucosa when ALA-noveon and ALA-lutrol were used (preferable results for noveon). Keltrol was eliminated from the study after these investigations. Only ALA-noveon gel was retained for studies of the relationship between ALA dose and fluorescence. Fluorescence measurements in-vivo showed that ALA concentration and application time had an influence on protoporphyrin IX synthesis. Maximum intensity (2091 counts s-1) was found with 2 mg mL-1 ALA, and fluorescence intensities differed with application time, reaching 1805 counts s-1 after 240 min. ALA-noveon, showing good adhesion and enabling efficient diffusion of ALA at a pH < 6, was considered the best formulation for maintaining ALA stability.
