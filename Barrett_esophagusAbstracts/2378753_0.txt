In the present paper we analyze the importance of gastro-oesophageal reflux in 20 patients with Barrett's oesophagus and in 20 patients with esophagitis without Barrett's mucosa; ten of this last group had mild esophagitis and ten severe inflammatory changes. In all the cases the oesophageal pH was measured during 24 hours; the results showed that although the reflux was more important in the group of patients with Barrett's esophagus than in the whole group of patients with esophagitis without Barrett's esophagus, figures were similar in the group with severe oesophagitis and the group with Barrett's oesophagus. We conclude that the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus includes factors other than gastroesophageal reflux.
