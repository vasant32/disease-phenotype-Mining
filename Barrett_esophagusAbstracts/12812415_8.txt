Biological tissues undergoing inflammation and dysplasia seem to exhibit changes in the intercellular space that can be sensed using low frequency electrical impedance methods. Basically, low frequency electric current flows through this space and its widening as well as the disruption of the tight junction decrease the resistance, facilitating current flow. The electrical changes accompanying structural changes from columnar tissue to adenocarcinoma in Barrett's metaplastic mucosa and gastric tissue are illustrated using resected tissue from 32 patients. Two hundred and fifty-eight biopsies were analysed, correlating their electrical resistivity (R) at 9.6 kHz and their histopathological interpretation. Compared to non-inflamed non-dysplastic columnar tissue (R = 4.9 ohms m), the results suggest a small but statistically significant decrease of electrical impedance in columnar tissue showing inflammation (R = 4.2 ohms m, p = 0.016) and a larger decrease when dysplasia is present (R = 3.4 ohms m, p = 0.040). If this method is validated further, this technique could be used to obtain guided biopsies from patients undergoing surveillance programmes for Barrett's oesophagus. We aim to refine this technique using a new system with lower frequencies and, possibly, in vitro (cultured cells) and in vivo (rats) models of Barrett's oesophagus.
