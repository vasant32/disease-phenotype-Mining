 BACKGROUND: Recently, the rate of postoperative long-term survival has increased in cases of esophageal cancer. We report on our analysis of postoperative reflux esophagitis (RE) at Tokai University. METHODS: We enrolled 48 patients who underwent gastric tube reconstruction after esophagectomy. The diagnosis of RE was confirmed by endoscopy. RESULTS: Of the 48 patients, 28 (58.3%) were found to have RE. Among the 28 patients with RE, only four (14.3%) reported symptoms. The distribution of the severity of RE according to the Los Angeles classification in the patients was as follows: grade M, 1 (3.6%); grade A, 2 (7.1%); grade B, 6 (21.4%); grade C, 17 (60.7%); and grade D, 2 cases (7.1%). Barrett's epithelium was detected in 9 of the 28 patients (31%) with RE and in 3 of the 20 (15%) patients with no evidence of RE. CONCLUSIONS: To detect the presence of RE as well as monitor for recurrence and development of metachronous cancer, we consider it important to perform endoscopy regularly over the long term. As Barrett's epithelium is frequently encountered, care should be exercised to detect the specialized columnar epithelium showing dysplastic changes.
