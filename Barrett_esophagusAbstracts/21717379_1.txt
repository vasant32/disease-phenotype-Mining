Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an effective treatment for high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus in ablation-naïve patients, but no studies have evaluated its use in patients in whom ablative therapy has previously failed. We describe 14 patients with residual high-grade dysplasia following aminolevulinic acid or Photofrin (porfimer sodium) photodynamic therapy (PDT). An overall complete reversal of dysplasia was achieved in 86 % with a combination of RFA and rescue endoscopic mucosal resection. The median total follow-up is 19 months. The rate of strictures was 7 % (1/14) and there was a low rate of buried glands (0.5 % follow-up biopsies). These data suggest RFA is both safe and effective for eradication of high-grade dysplasia in patients in whom PDT has failed.
