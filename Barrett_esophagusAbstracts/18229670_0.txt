Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a problem frequently occurring among physically and intellectually disabled individuals. In this group of patients GERD is often overlooked, since the symptoms are usually non-specific. We present two cases of disabled children, who developed complications of GERD in the form of Barrett's esophagus, Barrett's ulceration and bleeding, the life-threatening events which were not preceded by typical GERD complaints.
