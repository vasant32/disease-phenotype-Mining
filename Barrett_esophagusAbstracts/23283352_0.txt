Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the premalignant lesion from which esophageal adenocarcinoma near the esophagogastric junction arises. The management of BE and the treatment of Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma (BEA) are important clinical issues in Europe and the United States. As the Helicobacter pylori infection rate in Japan is decreasing in the younger population, the incidence of BE and adenocarcinoma arising from BE may start increasing. Thus, we review the current status of BEA and its management. Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging is important for diagnosing dysplasia arising from BE. In Japan, adenocarcinoma arising from BE is managed the same way as squamous cell carcinoma in the same location. Strategies to prevent BEA may include medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and proton pump inhibitors, and anti-reflux surgery. Understanding the pathophysiology of BE will help to reduce the incidence of BEA.
