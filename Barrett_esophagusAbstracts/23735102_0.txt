The incidence of Barrett's-related adenocarcinoma of the esophagus continues to increase at an alarming rate. Studies to date show great promise for optical coherence tomography (OCT) in screening, surveillance, and guiding management of Barrett's esophagus. With continued innovation in rapid, accurate scanning systems, such as volumetric laser endomicroscopy or optical frequency domain imaging, advanced OCT seems likely to have an important impact. The next few years are likely to see the initiation of large clinical studies that will define the extent and significance of this impact.
