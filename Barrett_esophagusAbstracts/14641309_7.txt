Patients with Barrett's esophagus have been reported to have impaired visceral sensitivity to acid perfusion and distension compared with non-Barrett's refluxers, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Esophageal motility and clearance mechanisms may be important, and this study explored the relationship of motility with symptoms. Seventy-four patients with Barrett's esophagus were compared with 216 patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) with abnormal acid reflux scores, and 50 symptomatic patients who had normal acid exposure. All patients had esophageal manometry and 24-h pH monitoring. Thirty-six Barrett's patients also had 24-h bile reflux monitoring. Symptoms were assessed by Symptom Index (SI) during 24-h pH monitoring. Barrett's patients with normal motility had a significantly lower SI than GERD patients for similar acid exposure (P < 0.001). Barrett's patients with abnormal motility had higher acid exposure than those with normal motility (P < 0.05), but the SI values for this group was not significantly different from the GERD patients. SI and Bile reflux in Barrett's esophagus was not significantly different in patients with normal or abnormal motility. Barrett's patients had less sensitivity than GERD patients for similar acid exposure. Normal motility in Barrett's esophagus is associated with the poorest sensitivity and the presence of increased acid exposure is required in order to achieve sensitivity levels comparable with GERD patients.
