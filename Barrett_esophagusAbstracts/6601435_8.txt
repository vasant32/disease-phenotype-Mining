Three cases of patients with esophageal involvement by scleroderma, chronic reflux esophagitis, and adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus are presented. An underlying columnar metaplasia (Barrett esophagus) was identified in two patients and postulated in the third. It is believed that scleroderma patients with symptomatic chronic gastroesophageal reflux should be investigated for Barrett epithelium. If it is present, these patients should be followed and considered as having an increased risk for development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
