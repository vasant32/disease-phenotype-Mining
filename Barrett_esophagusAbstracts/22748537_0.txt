Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has gained popularity as treatment for Barrett's esophagus. Inclusive series of patients from initiation of our Barrett's Therapy Program were studied. Review of patients undergoing RFA for Barrett's was performed from September 2008 to May 2011. Patients'  outcomes were recorded and analyzed using standard statistical methods. Seventy patients were treated. Average age was 61 (28-70); 80 per cent were male. Seventy-four per cent had dysplasia; 44 low-grade and eight high-grade. A total of 75.7 per cent of patients had long and 24.3 per  cent had short segment Barrett's. Procedures per patient ranged from one to seven. Number of treatments in long- and short-segment groups were not different (P = 0.11). The maximum number of treatments in the short-segment group was five with a median of three (44.3%). For long segment,  the maximum of RFA procedures was seven, with a median of three (30.8%). Average procedure time was 20.8 minutes for long and 17.9 minutes for short segment. Mean follow-up was 16.1 (2-38) months. Complete response was accomplished in 81 per cent. There were 93.3 per cent of complete  responders in the short-segment group versus 75 per cent in the long (P = 0.24). Complications included dysphagia (1), transient chest and cervical pain (1), and abdominal pain (1). Comparing the first 25 per cent of the RFA procedures to the later 75 per cent or first 50 per  cent to second 50 per cent, there was no difference in operative time or complications. Two patients recurred, both in the long-segment group. RFA is a safe and effective means to eradicate Barrett's. By measure of treatment time, complication rate, and efficacy of therapy, there is minimal  or no "learning curve" for experienced endoscopists.
