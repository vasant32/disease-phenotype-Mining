Cellular autofluorescence was characterized in normal human esophageal cells and in malignant esophageal epithelial cells. The study was performed under excitation at 351 nm where the cell fluorescence is mainly due to the reduced pyridine nucleotides (NAD(P)H) with a very small contribution from the oxidized flavins (FMN, FAD) or lipopigments. The autofluorescence emission of squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma on Barrett's mucosa and normal cells was characterized by microspectrofluorimetry on monolayers and by spectrofluorimetry on cell suspensions. The relative contribution of each fluorophore to the fluorescence emission of the different cell types was evaluated by a curve-fitting analysis. A statistically highly significant difference was observed between the average intensity of the raw spectra of the different cell types. Tumoral cells had a fluorescence intensity approximately twice as high as that of normal cells. The results of the NAD(P)H quantitation analyzed by microspectrofluorimetry on single living cells and spectrofluorimetry on cell suspensions were consistent with those obtained by biochemical cycling assays, showing that the amount of intracellular NAD(P)H is higher in tumoral cells than in normal cells. Bound NAD(P)H concentration was found to be quite stable whatever the cell type while the amount of free NAD(P)H showed a very important increase in tumoral cells.
