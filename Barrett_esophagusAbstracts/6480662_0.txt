We reviewed the radiographic findings in thirty patients with columnar-lined (Barrett's) esophageal mucosa. Gastroesophageal reflux was observed in 90%, hiatal hernia in 83%, stricture in 80% and esophageal ulceration in 33%. Superficial nodular mucosal changes were detected on 50% of the air contrast esophagrams. Prominence of this pattern may be associated with dysplastic or early malignant change. In addition, four conditions associated with secondary lower esophageal sphincter incompetence were identified in our patient group. These were scleroderma, previous myotomy for achalasia, previous gastric surgery and long-term indwelling nasogastric tubes.
