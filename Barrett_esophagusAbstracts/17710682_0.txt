Helicobacter pylori infection is considered to be an important factor in the development of gastric cancer, while duodenogastroesophageal reflux is claimed to be the main cause of development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. A pronounced activation of PAR-2 receptors may be a common denominator in triggering the development of these cancers, and possibly pancreatic and colonic cancers as well. Evidence supporting such a concept is presented.
