The bcl-2 proto-oncogene encodes a protein that blocks programmed cell death (apoptosis). Although bcl-2 has been shown to be involved in the development of follicular lymphoma via a chromosomal translocation t(14;18), little is known about its function in non-hematolymphoid neoplasms. The bcl-2 protein is normally expressed in the regenerative crypt compartment of the colon, small intestine, and stomach, and has been found to be abnormally overexpressed as an early event in the dysplasia-carcinoma sequences of both ulcerative colitis-related and gastric neoplasias. This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of bcl-2 in the Barrett's metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. Thirty-six esophageal resection specimens were studied, using a monoclonal antibody to the bcl-2 protein on fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. Barrett's mucosa was present in each specimen: low-grade dysplasia in 35, high-grade dysplasia in 34, intramucosal carcinoma (IMC) in 23, and submucosal carcinoma in 13. In addition, a section of the gastric resection margin was evaluated for bcl-2 immunoreactivity in each case. In all cases, the regenerative compartment of the gastric mucosa in the resection margins stained for bcl-2; however, no immunoreactivity was seen in any of the cases of Barrett's mucosa with or without dysplasia or carcinoma. We conclude that, in contrast to its role in gastric neoplasia, bcl-2 alterations are not an important molecular marker in the neoplastic progression of Barrett's mucosa.
