Barret's esophagus (BE) is defined as a situation in which the distal esophageal squamous epithelium was replaced by columnar epithelium, with or without goblet cells. BE is considered a significant risk factor for the development of esophageal cancer, however, screening is recommended only for high risk patients. The new guidelines determine the proper terminology of the endoscopic appearance of BE and the way that biopsies should be taken. After BE is confirmed, surveillance is extremely important as its performance has been shown to prevent cancer and death. The surveillance is based on the endoscopic and pathological findings, highlighting the importance of advanced endoscopy and specialized pathology expertise. The guidelines determine the place of the endoscopic ablative technology and specialized surgery in these patients.
