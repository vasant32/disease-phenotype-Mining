The authors present their experience with the radionuclide esophagogram. Cases illustrating achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm, nutcracker esophagus, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, reflux esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux, Barrett's esophagus, hiatal hernias, pharyngoesophageal diverticulum, and malignant tumors of the esophagus are included. The radionuclide esophagogram proved to be a useful procedure in the diagnosis and follow-up of many esophageal diseases.
