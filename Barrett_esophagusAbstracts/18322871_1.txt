 BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Recently, several endoluminal procedures for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have been introduced. Most of these techniques have been abandoned because they lack long-term efficacy or have serious side effects. In a recently published prospective randomized, sham-controlled trial, the Plicator was shown to be effective at controlling reflux symptoms and esophageal acid exposure. In all previous studies, only a single implant was used. The aim of the present pilot study was to determine the safety and efficacy of two serially placed Plicator implants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients requiring maintenance therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were enrolled in this single-center pilot study. All patients received two Plicator implants. Exclusion criteria were hiatus hernia larger than 3 cm, grade IV esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal motility disorders. The primary study end point was at least 50 % improvement in the GERD Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) score. Secondary end points included GERD medication use, esophageal acid exposure, esophagitis grade, and heartburn/regurgitation scores. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients underwent endoscopic full-thickness plication using two serially placed Plicator implants. At 6 months after treatment, the proportion of patients achieving at least 50 % improvement in GERD-HRQL score was 68 %. Complete cessation of PPI treatment was achieved in 59 % of patients. In pH studies conducted at 6 months (n = 29), median percentage of time for which pH was below 4 decreased by 36 %, with 28 % of patients experiencing pH normalization. There were no serious adverse events requiring intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic full-thickness plication using two serially placed Plicator implants was both safe and effective in reducing esophagitis, GERD symptoms, medication use, and esophageal acid exposure.
