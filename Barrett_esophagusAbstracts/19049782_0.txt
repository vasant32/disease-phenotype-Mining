Esophago-pericardial fistula is a rare complication of benign esophageal pathologies. We present the case report of a patient with Barrett's esophagus complicated by an esophago-pericardial fistula managed by a multi-therapeutic approach to close the fistula using an autologous pericardial patch; placement of a coated, expandable, metallic esophageal stent; and a feeding jejunostomy.
