BACKGROUND: Obesity has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for the development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). AIM: To perform a prospective cohort study to determine whether there was a difference in body mass index (BMI) between patients with GERD and patients with Barrett's oesophagus (BE). METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients undergoing endoscopic evaluation for GERD and collected information regarding BMI, tobacco and/or alcohol use, and family history of GERD. Patients with non-erosive reflux disease underwent confirmatory 24-h pH testing. RESULTS: Seven hundred and fifty one patients with GERD (mean +/- s.d. age of 55.4 +/- 14.2 years, 74% male) entered the study, and BE was present in 165 (22%, 90% male, 79% Caucasian) patients. The mean GERD symptom duration was 10.3 +/- 0.4 years (range 1-62 years) with a mean body mass index of 27.8 +/- 0.2 kg/m(2) (range 15-55) Compared with patients having GERD alone, patients with BE were more likely to be older (P = 0.001), male (P < 0.001), current or prior tobacco users (P = 0.002), and with greater duration of GERD symptoms (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the BMI for patients with and without BE. CONCLUSIONS: While obesity is a risk factor for both GERD and BMI, patients with BE did not demonstrate increased BMI compared with patients having chronic GERD.
