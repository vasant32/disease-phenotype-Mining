BACKGROUND: Effective esophageal peristalsis is a major determinant of esophageal clearance function. The relation of esophageal body function with a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter and the development of esophageal mucosal injury in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease is unclear. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the relations among the manometrically determined esophageal clearance function, lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction, esophageal acid exposure, and the presence and severity of esophageal mucosal injury in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Normal values for the manometric assessment of esophageal clearance function were established in 50 normal volunteers and subsequently applied to 160 symptomatic patients with increased esophageal exposure to gastric juice and various grades of esophageal mucosal injury (no minimal surgery, esophagitis, stricture, and Barrett's esophagus). RESULTS: Defective clearance function was present in 47.5% of the patients; a defective lower esophageal sphincter was documented in 63.1%. Compromised esophageal clearance function was significantly more common in patients with a defective lower esophageal sphincter than in those with normal sphincter function (55% versus 33.8%). Esophageal acid exposure time and the prevalence and severity of esophageal mucosal injury were highest in patients with a defective sphincter and compromised clearance function. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that esophageal motor function deteriorates with increasing severity of mucosal injury. This appears to be due to persistent reflux of gastric juice across a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter. This may influence the choice and outcome of antireflux surgery. Surgical correction of a mechanically defective sphincter before the loss of esophageal body function is advocated.
