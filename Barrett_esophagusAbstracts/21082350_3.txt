 BACKGROUND: Obesity, gastroesophageal reflux, and Barrett's esophagus have all been linked to esophageal adenocarcinoma. In addition, the decline in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in affluent societies has also been suggested to be a major factor in the recent rise in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma. If H. pylori infection has a protective role, populations with a naturally low prevalence of H. pylori infection such as the ethnic Malays of Northeastern Peninsular Malaysia should have high rates of esophageal adenocarcinoma. AIM: To test this hypothesis, we investigated the incidence of esophageal carcinoma among the ethnic Malays of the state of Kelantan in Northeastern Peninsular Malaysia. METHODS: The pathology services in the state of Kelantan are provided by two main hospitals. The histopathological records of both hospitals were systematically examined to retrieve all cases of esophageal carcinoma diagnosed between 2004 and 2008. Incidence rates were determined based on the most recent population census. RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence rates (per 100,000 population) of esophageal adenocarcinoma among Malay men and women were 0.75 and 0.69, respectively. The corresponding rates for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were 0.66 and 1.34, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The low rates of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus in the study area, despite the fact that H. pylori infection is virtually absent, does not support the hypothesis that the absence of H. pylori infection is a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of these cancers.
