 BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Up-regulation of epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and down-regulation of E-cadherin are correlated with genesis, progression, invasion, and metastasis of tumor; however,their expressions,especially their association,in esophageal carcinoma have seldom been reported. This study was to detect expressions of EGFR and E-cadherin in esophageal carcinoma, and to analyze their relationship. METHODS: Expressions of EGFR and E-cadherin in 50 specimens of esophageal squamous carcinoma and 8 specimens of esophageal adenocarcinoma were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Positive rates of EGFR, and E-cadherin in esophageal squamous carcinoma were 72.0% (36/50), and 22.0% (11/50); while those in esophageal adenocarcinoma were 75.0% (6/8), and 25% (2/8). Positive rates of EGFR in esophageal squamous carcinoma of grades I, II, and III were 63.6%, 75.0%, and 81.3%, respectively. The expression of EGFR negatively correlated with that of E-cadherin (r=-0.341, P=0.008). CONCLUSION: The expression of EGFR in esophageal carcinoma is increased, while that of E-cadherin is decreased;down-regulation of E-cadherin may be associated with up-regulation of EGFR.
