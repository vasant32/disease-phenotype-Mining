The Barrett-esophagus develops as a consequence of chronic reflux disease. Though the columnar epithelium is a self-protection against gastric fluid nearly all complications of reflux-disease are combined with an endobrachyesophagus. The different types of columnar-epithelium require careful primary diagnosis. The treatment of symptomatic patients consists in an adequate therapy of the reflux disease. Long-term endoscopic and histologic controls are necessary in every case of Barrett's syndrome.
