 BACKGROUND: Few in vivo models of esophageal reflux and fundoplication suitable for the study of the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer exist. We describe a modification of a rat model of duodenoesophageal reflux that incorporates Nissen fundoplication and uses it to study the role of fundoplication in ameliorating esophageal reflux. METHODS: A previously described rat model of duodenoesophageal reflux was modified to include Nissen fundoplication. Reflux threshold (RT), defined as the gastric pressure required to cause gastroesophageal reflux during transgastric instillation of saline, was measured in 12 Sprague-Dawley rats at baseline, after cardiomyotomy with esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis (EGDA), after subsequent Nissen fundoplication, and, finally, after takedown of Nissen fundoplication (NF). RESULTS: Cardiomyotomy with EGDA induced no significant change in RT compared with baseline (mean RT +/- SD: 4.0 +/- 1.9 mmHg and 6.0 +/- 2.5 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.741). Nissen fundoplication led to a 14-fold increase in RT (56.4 +/- 18.2 mmHg) compared with cardiomyotomy. RT pressure reverted to baseline levels after NF takedown (4.7 +/- 2.9 mmHg, p < 0.001). Antegrade esophageal flow was demonstrated without an increase in distal esophageal pressure after NF. CONCLUSIONS: Nissen fundoplication creates a one-way antireflux mechanism that eliminates gastroesophageal reflux in this rat model. This modification of an in vivo model of duodenoesophageal reflux represents a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of NF on cardiomyotomy-induced reflux and distal esophageal exposure to duodenogastric refluxate, and could be useful in the study of the role of NF in preventing progression to BE and ECA.
