A 92-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for rehabilitation. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed 2 weeks after admission because of vomiting which was found to be due to a Barrett's esophageal carcinoma at the lower esophagus. We chose chemotherapy with TS-1 at the dose of 50 mg/day in consideration of his age and performance status. His difficulty in swallowing disappeared rapidly. After 7 days of treatment, grade 3 anorexia appeared, so the dosage of TS-1 was reduced to 25 mg/day. After the reduction of TS-1, anorexia soon disappeared. The regimen consisted of TS-1 every 6 weeks as 1 cycle. After 7 cycles of treatment, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and upper gastrointestinal series revealed that the tumor had a completely disappeared. The effects of chemotherapy were judged as CR. This case suggests that administration of TS-1 is an effective choice of chemotherapy not only for gastric carcinoma but also Barrett's esophageal carcinoma.
