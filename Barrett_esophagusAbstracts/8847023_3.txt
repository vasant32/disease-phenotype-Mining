BACKGROUND/AIMS: The role of DNA ploidy of tumor cells as a prognostic factor for survival after resection was evaluated in 40 patients with an adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus (28 men and 12 women; mean age, 61 years). MATERIALS AND METHODS: After resection of the esophagus, staging was performed according to the TNM-classification (UICC 1987). Tumor tissue specimens were reviewed for the histological differentiation grade and flow cytometry was performed on paraffin embedded tissue according to the method described by Hedley. RESULTS: There was no significant correlation between DNA-ploidy and TNM-stage or histological differentiation grade of the tumor. DNA ploidy, stage and grade as prognostic factors for the survival were evaluated by multivariate analysis. DNA ploidy significantly (p= 0.04) correlated with survival, also univariately. Patients with diploid tumors had 3- and 5-year survival rates of 51% and 25% respectively, as compared to 10% and 0% respectively for patients with aneuploid or tetraploid/increased G2 tumors. CONCLUSION: DNA ploidy is an independent prognostic factor for the survival of patients with an adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus.
