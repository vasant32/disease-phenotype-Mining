Adenocarcinoma arising in ectopic gastric mucosa has been reported more than 40 years ago. This report reviews our experience with Barrett's adenocarcinoma over 8 years. The definition remains subject to controversy. More than 50% of patients in our study had unfavorable course of disease. The hope for cure lies almost in early detection of tumors at which point a truly curative resection could be done. There is no difference in terms of survival comparing to the adenocarcinoma arising on normal esophagus.
