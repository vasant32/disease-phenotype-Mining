 BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to compare patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with or without Barrett's esophagus for severity and frequency of symptoms and their response to antireflux surgery. METHODS: Eighty patients with GERD and Barrett's esophagus and 93 concurrent patients with GERD alone, all of whom underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, were compared by using symptom scores graded by a Likert scale. RESULTS: Before fundoplication, patients with Barrett's esophagus had higher DeMeester scores. Symptom scores were not different for patients with versus without Barrett's esophagus before or after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. CONCLUSIONS: Before and after fundoplication, patients with Barrett's esophagus, despite more severe reflux, have symptoms nearly identical in frequency and severity when compared with patients with GERD alone. Regardless of presence of Barrett's, all improve dramatically with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Barrett's esophagus does not impact presentation before or outcome after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.
