Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a metaplastic lesion of the distal esophagus arising as a consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease. Multiple studies show that BE is associated with increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Epidemiological studies and animal models demonstrate that chronic inflammation triggered by repeated exposure to refluxate predisposes to the development of BE and EAC. The chronic inflammation is associated with cytokine alterations. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that stimulates cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance is frequently increased in different cancers. Importantly, IL-6 and transcriptional factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) that is activated by IL-6 are also increased in BE and EAC. This review critically appraises the role of IL-6/STAT3 pathway in progression of BE to EAC from the published evidence currently available.
