 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A new catheter-free outpatient oesophageal pH-meter system (Bravo) has recently been developed. The objective of this study is to test the tolerance, safety and efficacy of the system in the measurement of gastric-oesophageal reflux by comparing it with a conventional pH system. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The study was performed on a control group consisting of 10 healthy volunteers (group 1) and in a group of 40 patients with symptoms of gastric-oesophageal reflux disease (groups 2 and 3). An upper digestive system endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and oesophageal pH measurements with a conventional system and/or with the Bravo catheter-free system, was performed on all patients. All patients who had both tests done (groups 1 and 2) filled in a questionnaire on any physical problems and changes in their daily activity. RESULTS: The test tolerance was higher with the Bravo system in the 9 parameters studied. In the group of healthy volunteers (group 1), the median (range) of the total percentage of pH < 4 was 1.1% (0.5-3.1) with the conventional pH and 1.7% (0-3.4) with the Bravo. When comparing the patients with symptoms of gastric-oesophageal reflux disease (group 2) with those who had only one type of pH measurement made, the acid reflux was significantly higher in patients with Barrett's oesophagus than in the rest of the groups, with conventional pH as well as with the Bravo. If we analyse the patient group with disease due to gastric-oesophageal reflux with those on whom both techniques were used (group 3), 7 of the 10 patients had a pathological reflux that only showed up on measuring pH with the Bravo system. CONCLUSIONS: Catheter-free pH measurements (Bravo) is better tolerated and with better satisfaction for the healthy volunteers and patients than with conventional PH, even, on occasions being more efficient for studying acid reflux due to the lower incidence of negative results.
