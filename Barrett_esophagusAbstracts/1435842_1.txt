The case of a patient who had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome caused by a primary peripancreatic lymph node gastrinoma is presented. Accompanying diffuse pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia, a well-documented occurrence in hypergastrinemia, was present. A perforated esophageal ulcer in a Barrett's esophagus led to right-sided necrotizing pleuritis, septicemia, and death. The diffuse parathyroid hyperplasia also noted in the patient is thought to be secondary to chronic hypertensive renal failure rather than MEN-I syndrome.
