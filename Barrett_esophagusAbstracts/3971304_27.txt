Based on a retrospective review of nine patients with adenocarcinoma in a Barrett's esophagus and the reports of similar cases in the literature, a staging system for this malignancy was devised. A progression of changes could be identified that corresponded to the stages. These changes consisted of dysplasia progressing to carcinoma in situ and invasive malignancy with metastases. Stage III disease carried the same grim prognosis as a similar stage of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Earlier stages of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus appeared to have a better prognosis. White men with symptoms of reflux esophagitis, esophageal strictures, and/or hiatal hernias who have Barrett's esophagus extending proximal to the distal 10 cm of the esophagus appear to have a propensity to develop adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Consideration should be given to antireflux surgery and close follow-up by periodic esophagoscopy and biopsy of the esophagus in these patients. If neoplasia is found, the thoracic esophagus should be totally removed with the stomach or left colon anastomosed to the cervical esophagus. Because of the poor prognosis of Stage III disease, postoperative chemotherapy should be considered.
