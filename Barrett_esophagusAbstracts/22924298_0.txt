 INTRODUCTION: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a well established precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Both, surveillance and therapeutic strategies have been proposed over the years. Recent deve-lopment of endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) brought new perspectives in the treatment of BE, with excellent initial results. METHODS: The study of 40 pts with macroscopically visible BE on endoscopy and biopsy proven goblet cells presence, was conducted from January 2010 until March 2012. In all pts a complete symptomatic, endoscopic and manometric evaluation was performed. Initially RFA HALO 90 and 360 were performed in 28 and 12 pts respectively. Repeated treatments were conducted in 7 pts. The overall number was 50, while the mean number of RFA procedures per patient was 1.25. RESULTS: The mean circumferential length and maximal extent of BE were 1.61 and 3.29 cm respectively. We did not encounter esophageal perforation or hemorrhage during the procedure. Complications were transient short-term retrosternal pain (23 pts) and dysphagia (11 pts). Three months after the RFA mean values of cumulative symptom and heartburn score dropped significantly (p < 0.05). Functional diagnostics did not disclose any statistically significant decrease of lower esophageal sphincter pressure or esophageal body contraction amplitudes. One year foIlow-up was obtained in 26 pts and revealed a complete macroscopically visible BE eradication. So far, in 19 pts a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed up to 3 months after complete RFA BE eradication. CONCLUSION: HALO RFA procedure is safe and very effective in the treatment of pts with BE, does not lead to esophageal function impairment, and produces no long term and serious side effects.
