We have shown that a novel NADPH oxidase isoform, NOX5-S, is the major isoform of NADPH oxidases in an esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) cell line, FLO, and is overexpressed in Barrett's mucosa with high-grade dysplasia. NOX5-S is responsible for acid-induced reactive oxygen species production. In this study, we found that mRNA levels of NOX5-S were significantly higher in FLO EA cells than in the normal human esophageal squamous cell line HET-1A or in a Barrett cell line, BAR-T. The mRNA levels of NOX5-S were also significantly increased in EA tissues. The data suggest that NOX5-S may be important in the development of EA. Mechanisms of functional regulation of NOX5-S are not fully understood. We show that small G protein Rac1 was present in HET-1A cells, BAR-T cells, and EA cell lines FLO and OE33. Rac1 protein levels were significantly higher in FLO and OE33 cells than in HET-1A or BAR-T cells. Knockdown of Rac1 with Rac1 small interfering RNA significantly decreased acid-induced increase in H(2)O(2) production in FLO EA cells. Overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 significantly increased H(2)O(2) production, an increase that was blocked by knockdown of NOX5-S. By immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation, we found that NOX5-S was present in the cytosol of FLO EA cells and colocalized with Rac1 and SERCA1/2 Ca(2+)-ATPase which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We conclude that Rac1 may be important in activation of NOX5-S in FLO EA cells.
