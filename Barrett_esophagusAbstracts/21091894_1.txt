Barrett's esophagus (BE) is defined as abnormal specialized columnar metaplasia with intestinalization in place of the normal squamous esophageal epithelium. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a known risk factor for BE; nonetheless BE is also detected in asymptomatic individuals. Other risk factors for BE include smoking, male gender, age over 50 and obesity. Patients diagnosed with BE (without dysplasia) are recommended to undergo endoscopic surveillance every 3-5 years. Advances in imaging techniques (such as narrow band imaging, autofluorescence imaging and confocal laser endomicroscopy) have the potential to improve the detection of dysplasia and early cancer, thus making surveillance a more cost-effective endeavor. Patients with high grade dysplasia (HGD) and early cancer have a high rate of progression to invasive adenocarcinoma and traditionally these patients were treated with esophagectomy. The rapid advancement of endoscopic therapeutic techniques along with a low risk of complications have made endoscopic therapy an acceptable alternative to an esophagectomy in patients with HGD and early cancer. Several endoscopic treatment techniques such as endoscopic mucosal resection, multipolar electrocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, argon plasma coagulation, cryotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation have been studied for endoscopic treatment.
