 INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a risk factor for gastroesophageal reflux and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. However, only a few studies have examined obesity and lifestyle risk factors in relation to Barrett's oesophagus. In this prospective study we assessed the presence of oesophagitis and Barrett's oesophagus in obese patients selected for laparoscopic gastric banding. METHODS: 1049 obese patients were referred for laparoscopic gastric banding (233 males; mean age 41.0±10.7 years). oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed before surgery to check for upper gastrointestinal tract disorders, especially hiatal hernia, signs of inflammation and/or erosions and/or ulcers of the oesophageal mucosa, and Barrett's epithelium. RESULTS: Mean body mass index was 45.15±6.46 kg/m(2). Overall 86/1049 (8.2%) patients had endoscopic signs of oesophagitis: 84 grade A, 1 grade B and 1 grade C, according to the Los Angeles classification. Hiatal hernia was detected in 127 patients (12.1%), with a mean size of 2.1±0.7 cm (range 1-4 cm); of these, 38 (29.9%) had oesophagitis (37 grade A and 1 grade B). No patients had any visible length of columnar epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: We could not confirm a high prevalence of Barrett's oesophagus in this series of obese patients.
