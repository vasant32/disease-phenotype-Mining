Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a premalignant lesion in which columnar epithelium (containing goblet cells) replaces esophageal squamous cells. Previous evidence suggested that hydrophobic bile acids and zinc deficiency each play a role in BE development. We fed wild-type C57BL/6 mice a zinc-deficient diet containing the hydrophobic bile acid, deoxycholic acid for various times up to 152 days. All mice fed this diet developed esophagitis by 69 days on the diet and 63% of the mice on this diet for 88 to 152 days also developed a BE-like lesion. Esophageal tissues showed thickened mucosa, increased proliferation, and increased expression of markers associated with oxidative and nitrosative stress. The newly formed BE-like lesions expressed Mucin-2, a marker of columnar differentiation. They also showed translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappaB and beta -catenin to the nucleus and typical histological changes associated with BE lesions. This mouse model of esophagitis and BE is expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of BE pathogenesis and to strategies for prevention of BE progression to cancer.
