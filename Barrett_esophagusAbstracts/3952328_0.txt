Three cases are presented in which double-contrast esophagograms revealed one or more plaquelike lesions in the distal esophagus, representing pseudomembrane formation in patients with severe reflux esophagitis. Although to our knowledge this finding has not been reported previously in the radiologic literature, pseudomembranes have been documented endoscopically in patients with reflux esophagitis and biopsy-proved Barrett esophagus. Radiologists should be aware of this finding, since these pseudomembranes may be indistinguishable radiographically from plaquelike carcinomas arising in Barrett esophagus.
