 BACKGROUND/AIMS: The incidence of Barrett's cancer is increasing in Western countries, but there have been only a few case reports of this condition in Korea. The aim of this study was to elucidate the endoscopic and pathologic characteristics of Barrett's cancer in a single center in Korea. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the demographic, endoscopic, and pathologic characteristics of six patients with Barrett's cancer, defined as a tumor centered above the esophagogastric junction and surrounded by Barrett's esophagus. RESULTS: All six patients were male, and three (50%) were symptomatic. Barrett's cancer had developed from short-segment Barrett's esophagus in all patients. All tumors were located on the right side of the lower esophagus and showed hyperemic mucosal changes. Three patients were treated surgically and three by endoscopic resection. All cases had pathologic evidence of Barrett's cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of Barrett's cancer requires meticulous endoscopic observations of subtle mucosal color and morphological changes around the esophagogastric junction.
