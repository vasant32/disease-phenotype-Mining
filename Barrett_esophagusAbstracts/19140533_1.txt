 OBJECTIVES: Transnasal esophagoscopy (TNE) is rapidly becoming integrated into otolaryngological practice. A recent report has shown an incongruence between an endoscopic diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus and biopsy-proven Barrett's esophagus in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). The goal of this study was to determine whether performing TNE with narrowband imaging (NBI) improves on the diagnostic yield in the otolaryngologist's hands. Narrowband imaging involves the use of filtered light to enhance the mucosal microvasculature pattern and has been shown to be highly sensitive to detecting Barrett's esophagus under conventional esophagoscopy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 111 patients with LPR who underwent TNE by the same otolaryngologist was carried out. Pentax EE-1580K (white light only) and Olympus GIF-N180 (with NBI) endoscopes were used in 58 and 53 patients, respectively. Microcup biopsy of the squamocolumnar junction was obtained when Barrett's esophagus was suspected. RESULTS: Biopsy-proven Barrett's esophagus was found in 13.5% of the patients. According to white light only and NBI, 7 of 58 (12.1%) and 8 of 53 (15.1%), respectively, had biopsy-proven Barrett's esophagus. Three patients had dysplasia on biopsy (2.7%), and all of these cases were detected under NBI (5.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Narrowband imaging may be a useful adjunct in increasing the diagnostic sensitivity of TNE in the hands of the otolaryngologist.
