Despite the wide range of probes commercially available for interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), the supply of locus-specific probes is limited to genes or chromosomal regions commonly altered in genetic diseases or during carcinogenesis. Generation of these probes is therefore desirable to accommodate individual research requirements. Hence, we detail the methodology required to design and produce custom locus-specific interphase FISH probes for any human genomic region of interest and their application was illustrated in cytogenetic investigations of Barrett's tumourigenesis. Previously utilising FISH, we observed that Barrett's tissues demonstrated chromosome 4 hyperploidy [Gut 52 (2003) 623], but as centromeric probes were used in this analysis, it was not known if the whole chromosome was amplified. We consequently generated single-copy sequence probes for the 4p16.3 and 4q35.1 subtelomeric loci. Multicolour FISH was subsequently performed on interphase preparations originating from patients with Barrett's esophagus at varying histological grades, thus demonstrating the whole region of chromosome 4 was amplified within the tissues. Additionally, probes for the DNA methyltransferase genes were produced to determine if gene dosage alterations were responsible for increasing methylation activity during Barrett's neoplastic progression. No significant alterations at the DNMT1 and DNMT3a loci were detected. An increased copy number of these genes is therefore not the basis for the hypermethylation commonly observed in this premalignant lesion.
