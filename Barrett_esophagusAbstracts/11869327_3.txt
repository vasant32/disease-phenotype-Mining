It has been shown previously that patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not always have increased esophageal acid exposure on 24 h pH monitoring. The recent recognition of carditis as a sensitive marker for GERD raises the possibility for patients with mild disease to have normal esophageal acid exposure but inflamed cardiac mucosa on biopsies of the cardia, which may be an early sign of GERD. To test this hypothesis, 171 consecutive patients evaluated for symptoms of GERD and no increased esophageal acid exposure, Barrett's esophagus or erosive esophagitis were divided into those with and without carditis. Esophageal acid exposure and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) characteristics were compared between the two groups. Comparisons were done using the Mann-Whitney U-test for non-parametric data. There were 82 patients with histologic evidence of carditis and 89 patients without carditis. Patients with carditis had a more deteriorated sphincter, determined by overall and abdominal length and resting pressure, and significantly higher esophageal acid exposure (P < 0.05). Patients with symptoms of GERD and histologic evidence of carditis may have early or mild reflux disease, which is confined to the sphincter.
