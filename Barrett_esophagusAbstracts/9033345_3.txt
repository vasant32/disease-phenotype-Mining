Transhiatal herniation of colon is uncommon after transhiatal esophagectomy. Two patients with this complication are presented. Presenting symptoms vary depending on the size and contents of the hernia. Patients may be asymptomatic. The diagnosis is suggested by plain chest radiography, and treatment, in symptomatic patients, is surgical reduction of the hernia via a laparotomy.
