We have evaluated the correlation between vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) plasma concentration and severity of gastroesophageal reflux in patients with Barrett's esophagus and the possible differences in the VIP values of these patients compared with healthy volunteers. We also evaluated the relation between VIP plasma concentration and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure in 24 patients with Barrett's esophagus. The mean VIP plasma concentration in 14 patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux was 25.6 +/- 0.75 pg/ml, significantly higher than the mean value observed in 10 patients with moderate reflux (18.9 +/- 0.67 pg/ml) (p less than 0.01). The mean LES resting pressure was significantly lower in the group of patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux than that observed in patients with moderate reflux (3 +/- 0.64 and 10.3 +/- 0.69 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.01). The mean VIP plasma concentration in 11 healthy volunteers (20.6 +/- 0.65 pg/ml) was significantly lower than the mean value observed in the subgroup of patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux (p less than 0.01). VIP values in patients with moderate reflux were not significantly different from those observed in our volunteers. There was a significant correlation between LES pressure and VIP plasma level (r = -0.9253; p less than 0.01). In conclusion, it is possible that the decreased LES resting pressure observed in patients with Barrett's esophagus and severe gastroesophageal reflux may be due to impairment of the VIPergic innervation, resulting in an increased local VIP release with possible overflow to peripheral plasma.
