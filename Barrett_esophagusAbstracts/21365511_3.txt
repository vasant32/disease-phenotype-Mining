 INTRODUCTION: Multiband mucosectomy (MBM) is a relatively new technique for endoscopic resection in Barrett's esophagus. This ligate-cut technique uses a modified variceal band ligator allowing for six consecutive resections without prior submucosal lifting. The aim was to evaluate the safety of MBM and its efficacy for complete endoscopic removal of delineated target areas in Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: Prospective registration of all MBM procedures in Barrett's esophagus was carried out between November 2004 and October 2009 in two hospitals. Prior to MBM, the target area was delineated with coagulation markings, followed by endoscopic resection until the delineated area was completely resected. Primary end points were acute (during procedure) plus early complications (<30 days) and the rate of complete endoscopic resection of the delineated target area. RESULTS: A total of 243 MBM procedures, with 1060 resections, were performed in 170 patients. MBM was performed for focal lesions (n=113), for Barrett's esophagus removal as part of a (stepwise) radical endoscopic resection protocol (n=117), and as escape treatment after radiofrequency ablation (n=13). The only acute complication was bleeding (in 3%, endoscopically managed); no perforations occurred despite absence of submucosal lifting. Early complications consisted of delayed bleeding (in 2%, endoscopically managed) and stenosis, which occurred in 48% of patients treated in a (stepwise) radical resection protocol; patients treated for focal lesions or in escape treatment showed no stenosis. Complete endoscopic resection was achieved in 91% of the focal lesions, in 86% of cases treated under the (stepwise) radical endoscopic resection protocol, and 100% for escape treatment after radiofrequency ablation. CONCLUSION: MBM is a safe and effective technique for the removal of delineated target areas in Barrett's esophagus.
