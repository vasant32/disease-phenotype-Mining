The incidence of adenocarcinomas in Barrett's esophagus has been rising in the last two decades in the United States and Western Europe for yet unknown reasons. We reported previously a large multi-institutional trial implicating p53 mutations as being involved in the pathogenesis of Barrett's cancer and representing an early marker for the malignant potential of Barrett's epithelium. A prospective study was performed to evaluate the prognostic impact of p53 mutations on survival in 59 patients with Barrett's cancer. Tissue for DNA analysis was obtained by endoscopic biopsy or immediately after surgical resections from the tumor, Barrett's epithelium, and normal stomach and esophagus. p53 mutation analysis was performed by PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism screening of exons 5-9 and DNA sequencing to unequivocally prove the presence of a mutation. p53 mutations were identified in 30 of 59 (50.8%) patients. The presence of a p53 mutation in the tumor had a significant impact on survival after curative resections (RO-resections) with cumulative 5-year survival probabilities of 68.8+/-9.7% for mutation-negative tumors and 24.3+/-9.9% for mutation-positive tumors (log rank: P < 0.001). By Cox proportional hazard analysis, including the parameters of gender, age, Union International Contre Cancer tumor stage, grading, and p53 mutation status, only Union International Contre Cancer tumor stage (P < 0.0001) and p53 mutation status (P < 0.02) were of significant independent prognostic importance. p53 mutation analysis by DNA sequencing is of significant independent prognostic importance next to histopathological tumor stage in patients with curatively resected (RO-resection) Barrett's cancer. It appears that p53 mutational status is a valuable parameter to define low-risk (p53 mutation-negative) and high-risk (p53 mutation-positive) groups for treatment failure after curative resections.
