 BACKGROUND: Human chorionic gonadotrophin beta (hCGbeta) is expressed in several non-trophoblastic tumours, and this is usually associated with aggressive behaviour. Little is known about hCGbeta expression in Barrett's adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the hCGbeta profile in a large series of surgically resected Barrett's adenocarcinoma (a) at mRNA level using real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and (b) at protein level using immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal antibody and with a monoclonal antibody specific for free hCGbeta. We then sought links between the hCGbeta protein expression pattern and clinical and pathological parameters, including patient outcome as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. RESULTS: hCGbeta protein expression was observed in 43 of 76 (57%) Barrett's adenocarcinomas. We showed a strong correlation between hCGbeta protein abundance and CGB mRNA level. We observed a statistical link between hCGbeta protein expression and infiltrative tumour type ( P=0.023), perineural neoplastic invasion ( P=0.007) and VEGF protein expression ( P=0.016). hCGbeta expression tended to be associated with a poor outcome (16% versus 36% survival 8 years after resection). CONCLUSION: Expression of hCGbeta correlates with specific infiltrative characteristics and is associated with higher VEGF expression. Both molecules may play a co-ordinated role in the development of Barrett's adenocarcinomas.
