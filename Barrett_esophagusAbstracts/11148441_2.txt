BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic rise in incidences of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. It has been suggested that the introduction and use of acid suppression therapy may be a factor in the rising incidences of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: This was a record linkage study, using a prescribing database and an endoscopy database. Patients who had undergone their first endoscopy during the period 1992-1995 and received the diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus or oesophagitis were identified. The prescribing of acid suppressants was compared for the 3 years prior to endoscopy, between those with Barrett's oesophagus and those with oesophagitis. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the Barrett's patients and the oesophagitis patients in the proportion that had been exposed to acid suppression therapy (53.4% vs. 51.7%, P=0.704). The mean number of days of prescribing among those who had been exposed to acid suppression therapy was higher in the Barrett's group (340.5 vs. 237.0 days, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Barrett's oesophagus have received more acid suppressant therapy prior to diagnosis. The reasons for this are not clear. However, 46.6% of Barrett's patients have not been exposed to acid suppressant therapy.
