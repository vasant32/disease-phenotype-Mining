The current animal models of esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus consist of surgeries that divert the gastroduodenal contents to the esophagus. The limitations of these models are the inability to control the amount and concentration of the refluxate and the causing of significant postoperative stress and morbidity. Eighteen adult rats were cannulated at the upper esophagus and connected to a subcutaneous osmotic micropump to perfuse the esophageal lumen with bile and acid. Animals were sacrificed after 7 days of perfusion. Histological changes were determined. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione were measured. Histopathological changes in the bile- or acid-perfused esophagus were consistent with the findings associated with reflux esophagitis. Enhanced proliferation and apoptosis were seen, along with increased oxidative stress. The external esophageal perfusion model enabled precise control of the injurious agent. It induced the histologic and cellular injury of reflux esophagitis after 7 days.
