Our study aimed to determine, by counting sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus (MN) frequencies, whether genetic impairment and DNA damage have an effect on the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus (BE). This study was conducted between June 2007 and November 2008 in the Erzurum Training and Research Hospital. We analyzed SCE and MN frequencies in 30 patients with BE, and in 30 control cases. SCE was significantly increased in BE patients compared with controls (6.89 +/- 1.04 vs. 5.01+/- 0.88, P < 0.001). Similarly, MN was significantly increased in BE patients compared with controls (3.48 +/- 1.08 vs. 1.83 +/- 0.64, P < 0.001). Our data indicate that the increased SCE and MN rates in lymphocytes of patients with BE may reflect genomic instability or deficiency of DNA repair capacity.
