 BACKGROUND: The Barrett's to adenocarcinoma sequence is characterized by molecular changes including activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and related cytokines. In this observational nonrandomized study this molecular environment was compared in matched asymptomatic cohorts who had undergone either fundoplication or therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). METHODS: Asymptomatic patients with long-segment Barrett's esophagus had endoscopic biopsy specimens taken from 2 cm below the squamocolumnar junction for measurement of activated NF-kappaB and a panel of cytokines and growth factors. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were recruited (surgical: n = 18, medical: n = 19). The mean patient age was 51 years, and the mean follow-up period was 5.6 years. There were no differences in the length of Barrett's segment and endoscopic and histopathologic features in both groups. Mean activated NF-kappaB p50 and p65 subunits, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, and interleukin-8 levels, were significantly (P < .05) lower in the surgically treated group. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proxy support to the thesis that antireflux surgery may provide an environment that is less inflammatory and tumorigenic than that observed in medically treated patients.
