Savary's ulcer is a rare and little known peptic ulcer situated just above Barrett's esophagus. It is predominant in elderly women, bleeds less than Barrett's ulcer and is almost always associated with peptic stenosis. It is, like Barrett's and Wolf's ulcers, a complication of gastroesophageal reflux and not of Barrett's esophagus.
