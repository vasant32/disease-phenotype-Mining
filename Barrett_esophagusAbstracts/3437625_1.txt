A 66-year-old woman, who had a stricture of the distal esophagus with Barrett's epithelium caused by gastroesophageal reflux, was operated upon by means of the fundic patch method. Preoperative manometric and pH studies revealed that the patient had a cardiac incompetence and a delayed acid clearance of the esophagus. Endoscopic biopsies between 33-35 cm from the incisors, above the gastroesophageal junction, showed columnar metaplasia with a villiform surface, mucous glands, intestinal goblet cells, moderate inflammatory changes and focal mild dysplasia. After the operation, relief of the dysphagia and reflux symptoms were obtained successfully, and an endoscopy done 7 months later demonstrated that the esophageal lumen was adequate enough for passage, and that there was improvement of the esophagitis, though persistent Barrett's esophagus without malignancy still existed. These results indicate that the fundic patch operation with the formation of a mucosal valve and 270 degrees fundoplication is a useful method of choice for benign strictures of the lower esophagus.
