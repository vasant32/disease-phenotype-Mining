Reflux of acidic gastric contents and bile acids into the lower esophagus has been identified to have a central role in esophageal malignancy and is reported to upregulate caudal-related homologue 2 (CDX2), a regulatory gene involved in embryonic development and axial patterning of the alimentary tract. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of CDX2 in a well-defined series of human esophageal tissues, comprising reflux-induced esophagitis, premalignant Barrett esophagus (BE), and primary esophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC). To explore potential molecular regulatory mechanisms, we also studied the expression of beta-catenin, SOX9, and CDX2 promoter methylation in esophageal tissues, in addition to the effect of bile acids and nitric oxide (NO) on CDX2 expression in the normal human esophageal cell line Het1A. Relative to matched normal esophageal epithelia, CDX2 was overexpressed in esophagitis (37% for RNA; cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in 48% of tissues), a high proportion (91%) of BE tissues, and in EADC (57% for RNA; cell nuclear immunopositivity in 80%). An association with beta-catenin expression was seen, but not with SOX9 or CDX2 promoter methylation. In Het1A cells, CDX2 was upregulated following exposure to bile acids and NO, alone and in combination. These results further implicate CDX2 and beta-catenin in the molecular pathogenesis of human EADC. The observed synergistic effect of NO on the efficacy of bile acid-induction of CDX2 suggests a novel role for NO in modulating the development of the Barrett phenotype and esophageal adenocarcinogenesis.
