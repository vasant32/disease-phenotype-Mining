HYPOTHESIS: Preoperative assessment can identify the predictors of esophageal shortening in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. DESIGN AND SETTING: Patient comparison study in a university-based tertiary care center. PATIENTS: A total of 236 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease underwent primary antireflux procedures. Sixty-five patients were suspected of having a short esophagus and underwent a transthoracic approach. In 37 patients, a lengthening procedure was necessary to avoid tension on the repair. The remaining 28 patients were thought-after complete esophageal mobilization-to have sufficient length for a repair without needing a gastroplasty. An abdominal approach (laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication) was performed on 171 patients judged to have normal esophageal length. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Univariate and multivariate analyses of preoperative variables were performed to identify predictors of a short esophagus. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, manometric esophageal length below the fifth percentile of normal was associated with esophageal shortening. On multivariate analysis, only the presence of an esophageal stricture predicted the need for a Collis gastroplasty (odds ratio, 7.5). The presence of Barrett's esophagus of 3 cm or greater identified patients in whom the transthoracic esophageal mobilization alone was sufficient (odds ratio, 3.4). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a stricture was associated with esophageal shortening sufficient to require a gastroplasty. Transthoracic esophageal mobilization alone was usually sufficient to perform a safe repair without tension in patients with a Barrett's esophagus of 3 cm or greater.
