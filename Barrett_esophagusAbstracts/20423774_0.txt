The endoscopic therapy has been used in the treatment of early stage neoplastic esophageal lesions with great success. The endoscopic ultrasound is a useful tool for the correct staging of these lesions. The staging accuracy of esophageal cancer with endoscopic ultrasound reaches 80% for T stage and 77% for N stage. The endoscopic approach provides complete resection of lesions confined to the mucosal layer, is a safety procedure with complications reported to occur from 3% to 13%. The morbidity and mortality rates after an endoscopic mucosal resection have been reported to be less than those posterior to esophagectomy. We present a case of a patient with high surgical risk, who underwent an upper endoscopy because of long history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and uncontrollable hiccup with successful endoscopic mucosal resection with plastic cap and polipectomy loop of an early stage esophageal adenocarcinoma derived of Barrett s esophagus. Key words: endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic ultrasound, early stage esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophagectomy, Mexico.
