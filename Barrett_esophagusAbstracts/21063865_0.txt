OPINION STATEMENT: Progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) or scleroderma is characterized by fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs. Gastrointestinal disease occurs in up to 90% of patients, with the esophagus being the most commonly affected organ. Heartburn, dysphagia, and regurgitation occur in most patients. Esophageal manometry aids in diagnosing PSS. Endoscopy rules out complications, such as Barrett's esophagus, Candida esophagitis, and cancer. Lifestyle modifications should be implemented, including avoidance of alcohol, nicotine, and NSAIDs. Proton pump inhibitor therapy should be instituted, although it is unclear whether the dose should be adjusted according to symptoms or to 24-hour pH monitoring. Prokinetic agents are useful in the early stages of PSS when gastrointestinal musculature is still intact. Metoclopramide improves reflux, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and gastric emptying but has an inconsistent effect on esophageal peristalsis. A decision on when to perform antireflux surgery, if at all, is controversial. Esophageal disease in PSS is a common and difficult-to-treat problem.
