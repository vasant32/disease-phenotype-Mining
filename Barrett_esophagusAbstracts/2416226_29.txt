To evaluate the consequences of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, six patients with esophageal mucosal biopsies showing dysplastic Barrett's mucosa in the absence of clinically evident esophageal carcinoma were identified and their clinicopathologic features reviewed. The patients, four men and two women, averaged 60 years and had long histories of gastroesophageal reflux. Four patients had high-grade dysplasia; two had low-grade. Dysplastic Barrett's mucosa appeared to arise most commonly from specialized-type Barrett's mucosa. After a mean follow-up of 29 months, four patients, all with high-grade dysplasia, had esophageal resections. Three of the four were found to have invasive adenocarcinoma, which extended through the esophageal wall in two patients. The fourth patient had a noninvasive adenomatous polyp ("Barrett's adenoma"), an infrequently described form of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus. The two patients with low-grade dysplasia had developed no clinical indications of carcinoma. The results confirm that dysplastic Barrett's mucosa, particularly the high grade, is a morphologic marker for adenocarcinoma. Biopsy surveillance of patients with Barrett's esophagus is histologically feasible, but prospective studies are required to prove its effectiveness.
