In the current paper we present results of application of endoscopic time-domain OCT (EOCT) with lateral scanning by forward looking miniprobe. We analysed material of clinical studies of 554 patients: 164 patients with urinary bladder pathology, and 390 with gastrointestinal tract pathology. We reviewed the materials obtained in different clinics using the OCT device elaborated at the Institute of Applied Physics. We demonstrate results of EOCT application in detection of early cancer and surgery guidance, examples of combined use of OCT and fluorescence imaging. As a result, we show the diagnostic accuracy of EOCT in specific clinical tasks. The sensitivity of EOCT cancer determination in Barrett's esophagus is from 71% to 85% at different stages of neoplasia with specificity 68% for all stages. As for bladder carcinoma, the sensitivity and specificity are 85% and 68%, respectively. In colon dysplasia EOST demonstrates high efficacy: sensitivity 92% and specificity 84%.
