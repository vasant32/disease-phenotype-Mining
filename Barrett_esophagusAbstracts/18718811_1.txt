 BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been reported in squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus and has been recently described in Barrett's oesophagus, a premalignant condition which may give rise to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. OBJECTIVES: To investigate HPV infection in Barrett's oesophagus in a UK population. STUDY DESIGN: DNA was extracted from 73 Barrett's oesophagus biopsies and examined for the presence of DNA for 14 high risk (HR) and 6 low risk (LR) HPV types. RESULTS: HPV DNA was present in only 1 of 73 samples; genotyping indicated this was a high risk type 51 infection. CONCLUSIONS: HPV infection appears unlikely to be a significant factor in the aetiology of Barrett's oesophagus in the UK.
