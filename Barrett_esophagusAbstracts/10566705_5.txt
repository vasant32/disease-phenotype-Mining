OBJECTIVE: The significance of intestinal metaplasia found in biopsy specimens taken from healthy appearing squamocolumnar junction is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of intestinal metaplasia at the esophagogastric junction in Japanese patients with no clinical diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: A total of 103 specimens from consecutive surgeries were studied. All subjects underwent surgical resection for squamous carcinoma of the esophagus. Microscopic examination was performed from the squamocolumnar junction to 4 cm distal to the squamocolumnar junction. The extent of intestinal metaplasia was investigated in detail. Microscopic columnar-lined esophagus was defined as columnar epithelium with esophageal-type submucosal glands. RESULTS: The extent of intestinal metaplasia varied and was usually identified at intervals. Intestinal metaplasia exactly at the squamocolumnar junction was identified in 29 of 103 specimens (28%). Microscopic columnar-lined esophagus was identified in five of the 103 (5%), four of which had intestinal metaplasia in the columnar-lined esophagus. CONCLUSION: Intestinal metaplasia occurs frequently in the region of the esophagogastric junction in Japanese patients with squamous cell cancer of the esophagus.
