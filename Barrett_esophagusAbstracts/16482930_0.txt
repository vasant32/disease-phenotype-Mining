Here, we report a case of long-term survival after resection of an adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus with metastasis to Virchow's node. A 71-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a tumor in the lower third of the thoracic esophagus, located just beneath the tracheal bifurcation because of an hiatal hernia. On admission, she had a palpable lymph node in Virchow's node. The esophageal tumor and this lymph node were biopsied. They were pathologically found to be an adenocarcinoma in the esophagus which had metastasised to the lymph node. She underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection. The pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus with the UICC stage classification of pT1, pN1, pM1-LYM, Stage IVB. She received postoperative chemotherapy of cisplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil. The patient is well without recurrence at 14 years to date after surgery. We recommend thoracoabdominal esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy for an advanced carcinoma in the upper and middle thoracic esophagus regardless of histological types.
