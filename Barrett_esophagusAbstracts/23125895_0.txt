Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a premalignant lesion for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Observational studies suggest that endoscopic surveillance is associated with the detection of dysplasia and EAC at an early stage along with improved survival, but controversies still remain. The management of patients with BE involves endoscopic surveillance, preventive and clinical measures for cancer, and endoscopic and surgical approaches to treatment. Deciding upon the most appropriate treatment is a challenge. This study presents the results and the effectiveness of these practices.
