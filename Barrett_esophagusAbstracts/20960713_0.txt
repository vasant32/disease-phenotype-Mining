The esophageal epithelium of vertebrates was studied in phylogenetic aspect and in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). The comparative investigation was undertaken to detect phylogenetic recapitulations in the course of BE development. The complex of histochemical methods for selective demonstration of mucins and proteins was used. It was shown that in the phylogenetic series amphibians-reptiles-mammals, the formation of a protective barrier occurred in different ways. In BE, within the areas of metaplasia and dysplasia, partial recapitulation of a histochemical type of protective barrier, peculiar to the esophagus of amphibians and reptiles, seems to take place.
