 BACKGROUND & AIMS: The efficacy and safety of long-term acid suppression remains a subject for debate. We report data from patients with refractory reflux esophagitis who were undergoing maintenance therapy with >/=20 mg omeprazole daily for a mean period of 6.5 years (range, 1.4-11.2 years). METHODS: Patients with severe reflux esophagitis resistant to long-term therapy with H(2)-receptor antagonists and who were not eligible for surgery were evaluated at least annually for endoscopic relapse and histological changes in the gastric corpus. RESULTS: In 230 patients (mean age, 63 years at entry; 36% were >/=70 years), there were 158 relapses of esophagitis during 1490 treatment years (1 per 9.4 years), with no significant difference in relapse rates between Helicobacter pylori-positive and -negative patients. All patients rehealed during continued therapy with omeprazole at the same or higher dose. The annual incidence of gastric corpus mucosal atrophy was 4.7% and 0.7% in H. pylori-positive and -negative patients, respectively, which was mainly observed in elderly patients who had moderate/severe gastritis at entry. In patients with baseline moderate/severe gastritis, the incidences were similar: 7.9% and 8.4%, respectively. Corpus intestinal metaplasia was rare, and no dysplasia or neoplasms were observed. The adverse event profile was as might be expected from this elderly group of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term omeprazole therapy (up to 11 years) is highly effective and safe for control of reflux esophagitis.
