Gastroesophageal acid reflux (GER) is the primary risk factor for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In long segment Barrett's esophagus (LSBE) duodenogastroesophageal reflux (DGER) parallels acid reflux. The role of GER and DGER in short segment Barrett's esophagus (SSBE) remains to be determined. The aim of the present prospective study was to investigate the esophageal bile and acid reflux in patients with LSBE, SSBE and patients with GERD. Three groups of patients were studied: Patients with LSBE (n = 12), SSBE (n = 20) and patients with GERD without intestinal metaplasia (n = 33). Subjects underwent esophageal manometry and simultaneous 24-h pH and bile monitoring (Bilitec 2000). The thresholds for GER and DGER were a deMeester score > 14.7 and an absorbance value > 0.2 for 10.9% of total period, respectively. GER did not differ between the groups (p > 0.05). However, DGER differed between patients with LSBE, SSBE and GERD (14.7 vs 2.1 vs 2.1, respectively; p < 0.05). H. pylori status did not influence GER and DGER significantly. In contrast to patients with LSBE the DGER does not seem to play an important role in patients with SSBE and patients with GERD. This result indicates a different etiopathology of both long and short segment Barrett's esophagus.
