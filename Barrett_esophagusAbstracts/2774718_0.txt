Three patients with Barrett's esophagus and strictures between the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus, of 5 to 26 years duration at the time of the plasty, were treated with an infradiaphragmatic Nissen fundoplication and gastric vascular pedicle patch esophagoplasty, based on the right gastroepiploic vessels. Follow-up for 2 patients has been 6 and 7 years; both patients are asymptomatic except for periodic mild dysphagia in 1. The third patient developed cancer after 1 symptom-free year, and had esophagectomy with colon interposition. The results of this operation justify its use in recalcitrant lower intrathoracic esophageal strictures that do not respond to antireflux operation or dilation.
