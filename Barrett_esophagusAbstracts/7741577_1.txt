A 7 year old girl referred for investigation of hypogammaglobulinaemia had hypoalbuminaemia and severe necrotising oesophagitis on oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. Nissen fundoplication resolved all clinical and laboratory abnormalities, but she remains under surveillance because of histological findings of Barrett's oesophagus. Erosive reflux oesophagitis can present with minimal localising symptoms, and hypogammaglobulinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia, presumably from protein loss.
