Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) traditionally has been approached as a spectrum-continuum, suggesting that patients may progress over time and develop a more severe esophageal mucosal involvement. The spectrum-continuum conceptual model had a profound impact on the research priorities in GERD, as well as on proposed diagnostic algorithms and therapeutic strategies. Natural course studies in GERD are almost always retrospective and commonly afflicted with a plethora of shortcomings. Factors that affect quality of natural course studies in GERD include the following: index endoscopy results are taken at face value; antireflux treatment is consumed until index endoscopy and/or offered during the follow-up phase; pathophysiologic, anatomic, and genetic factors are overlooked; and lack of confirmation of the durability of the new esophageal mucosal finding. Functional heartburn is common and likely to affect a large subset of patients presenting with heartburn. Evidence to support progression of functional heartburn to nonerosive reflux disease (NERD), erosive esophagitis, or Barrett's esophagus is very scarce. The largest population-based or longest-duration natural course studies report that only 10% of patients progress from NERD to erosive esophagitis over time. The other GERD patients remained within their respective phenotypic presentations of GERD.
