Antireflux surgery, highly selective vagotomy (HSV) and Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy have been suggested for control of pathophysiological factors involved in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of this technique in patients with complicated (n = 21) and noncomplicated (n=45) BE. Complete evaluation of esophageal function, endoscopic histologic and clinical control was carried out before and 2 years after surgery. Post-operative results show recurrence of ulcer in patients with complicated BE, but no recurrence in patients with non-complicated BE. Preoperative esophageal ulcer and stricture were present in 85.3% and 14.3%, respectively, of patients with complicated BE. In this group, recurrence of these complications was 38.1% and 9.5% respectively. The technique offers excellent results in patients with non-complicated BE. However, in patients with complicated BE, the recurrence rate is higher, mainly because of the persistence of acid reflux into the esophagus.
