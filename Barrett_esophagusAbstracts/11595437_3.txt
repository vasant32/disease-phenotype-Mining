The physiologic importance of afferent sensory pathways in the esophageal motor functions has been recently recognised. Capsaicin-sensitive sensory afferents were shown to play a role in the maintenance of mucosal integrity of the GI tract, and regulation of human esophageal motility. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of topical application of capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce (Tabasco, 25%v/v, pH:7.0) suspension on the phasic activity of the human esophagus of healthy volunteers and patients with Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: The diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus was based on the findings of esophagoscopy and histology taken from the squamocolumnar junction of the esophagus. Esophageal motility was measured by perfusion manometry before and after application of red pepper sauce. RESULTS: Capsaicin containing red pepper sauce increases the motility response (LES tone, contraction amplitude, propagation velocity) of the human esophagus in healthy volunteers. This response failed in patients with Barrett's esophagus. CONCLUSION: Impaired esophageal sensory motor function may serve as one etiologic role in the development of Barrett's esophagus.
