Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a metaplastic process in which the normal squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus is replaced by columnar lined epithelium. The aim was to gain more insight in the process of metaplasia and to identify which genes are specifically expressed by the epithelial cells and the surrounding tissues in BE. Hereto, the gene expression profile of a BE epithelial primary cell culture was compared to that of a BE biopsy. To specifically obtain the epithelial cell layer, epithelial cells from biopsies of BE were cultured using a Barrett specific culturing medium. Serial analysis of gene expression was applied to obtain a transcription library of the primary epithelial cell culture. The transcriptome was analyzed and compared to a previously described transcriptome of a BE biopsy. Validation of results by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed using tissues of 16 BE patients and 16 primary cell cultures. Over 43,000 tags were sequenced. Genes specifically expressed by the Barrett epithelial cells were for instance Lipocalin 2 and Cyclin D1, whereas annexin A10, trefoil factor (TFF)1 and TFF2 were specifically expressed in the BE biopsies. The comparison of the gene expression profiles of BE primary cultured epithelial cells with BE biopsy defines a subset of genes that are specifically expressed by the epithelial cells and another subset that most likely is expressed by the underlying stromal tissues in the BE biopsy specimens.
