BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) was assessed in patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) using pH study and different quality-of-life indexes. We correlated both types of data and hypothesised that improvement in quality of life following LNF does not necessarily correlate with improvement in pH values. METHODS: Seventy patients presenting with typical symptoms of GERD (14 with Barrett's esophagus) underwent LNF between May 1997 and December 2000. All patients were evaluated both prior to and 3 months after surgery using 24-h pH study, endoscopy, and a validated quality-of-life questionnaire. RESULTS: Following LNF, reflux was reduced to normal in all but six patients. Howevers despite persistent reflux, the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GQLI), of these six patients improved postoperatively from 79.5 +/- 12.2 to 111.7 +/- 8.3. These results correlate with those of patients who had normal postoperative pH studies-namely, 88.5 +/- 19.3 to 112 +/- 16.7. There was no difference in quality-of-life improvement between patients with Barrett's esophagus and those without it. CONCLUSION: There is only a weak correlation between quality-of-life assessment and pH study. Because the patient's quality of life is likely to improve following LNF, an objective means parameter of assessing the effectiveness of antireflux surgery, such as pH study or endoscopy, is recommended.
