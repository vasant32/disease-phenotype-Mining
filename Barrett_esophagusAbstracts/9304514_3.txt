Establishment of cells in tissue culture from Barrett's columnar epithelium has been difficult. The aim of this study was to develop a successful tissue culture method employing a serum-free medium for cultivation of Barrett's epithelial cells. Fragments of Barrett's mucosal tissue were explanted in a 3:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium and Ham's F12, to initiate the outgrowth of epithelial cells. Subsequently, a commercial serum-free medium (formulated for the growth of keratinocytes) was used for the propagation of Barrett's oesophagus cells without fibroblast growth. Cells established in culture retained their epithelial morphology, stained positive for cytokeratin, and contained Alcian blue (pH 2.5) and periodic acid-Schiff reagent-positive/diastase-resistant vacuoles, confirming their origin from Barrett's epithelium. Electron microscopy showed tonofilaments, microvilli and desmosomes. Coating the surface of culture vessels was not required and four cell strains could be passaged up to 20 times with no fibroblast growth, in the keratinocyte serum-free medium.
