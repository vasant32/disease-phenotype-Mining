BACKGROUND: Management of Barrett's esophagus requires reduction of gastric acid secretion and screening for the development of adenocarcinoma. However, the current therapeutic options are ineffective in reducing the Barrett's mucosa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of endoscopic thermal coagulation of Barrett's mucosa as an alternative therapeutic approach and the recurrence of the disease in the long term. METHODS: Fourteen patients (11 men, 3 women; mean age 45.7 years) with Barrett's esophagus participated in the study. They underwent laparoscopic fundoplication and were symptom free with no defective fundoplication wraps before therapeutic endoscopy. Endoscopic thermocoagulation was performed with a flexible videoendoscope and a bipolar probe. Mucosal areas were treated once a month until the Barrett's mucosa disappeared. Endoscopy was performed 1 and 7 months after completion of the treatments and once a year thereafter. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 21.6 months (range 18 to 30 months). The mean length of Barrett's esophagus was 4.8 cm. Successful ablation of the columnar epithelium was achieved in 3.7 sessions, as defined by demonstration of normal squamous epithelium at histologic examination of biopsy samples collected after completion of the treatments and at follow-up evaluations. Three patients experienced short-term (10 days) odynophagia or dysphagia. All patients were symptom free with no evidence of Barrett's esophagus at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar electrocoagulation after antireflux operations is effective in promoting regression of Barrett's esophagus and has few complications. Endoscopic thermal coagulation might reduce risk for adenocarcinoma among these patients.
