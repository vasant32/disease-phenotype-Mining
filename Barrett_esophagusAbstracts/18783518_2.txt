In 2007 Helicobacter pylori research continued to deal with some controversies raised in the last decade. The main problems remain unsolved: peptic ulcer disease negative for H. pylori, synergism of H. pylori infection and aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclooxygenase 2 specific inhibitors, the role of H. pylori eradication in uninvestigated and nonulcer dyspepsia, and the possible protective effect of H. pylori infection against gastroesophageal reflux disease and its complications such as Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma. The incidence and prevalence of peptic ulcer disease as well as ulcer-related mortality are continuing to decline all over the world. The increasing consumption of anti-inflammatory and antisecretory drugs was not found to change the trend over the last period and therefore H. pylori was considered the key factor in causing ulcer-related mortality. Some progress has been achieved in understanding H. pylori-induced immunological processes, and attack mechanisms, as well as specific pathogenesis in uremic and cirrhotic patients. There is still a lot to learn about the bacterium and host factors related to H. pylori infection and its complications.
