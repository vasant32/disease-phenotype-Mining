 BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated whether infection with Helicobacter pylori and signs of chronic active gastritis and intestinal metaplasia in gastric biopsy samples were inversely associated with Barrett's metaplasia. METHODS: We studied gastric biopsy samples from 78,985 unique patients. Histologic findings were correlated with sociodemographic patient characteristics using multivariate logistic regression to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: H pylori infection, chronic active gastritis, and intestinal metaplasia had similar epidemiologic patterns. The presence of each, based on histology analyses, was significantly associated with that of the others. They were also characterized by similar geographic distributions within the United States. All 3 disorders were more common among men and among Medicaid patients (compared with those with other insurance) and were inversely associated with Barrett's metaplasia (less frequent in patients with Barrett's metaplasia). CONCLUSIONS: H pylori infection and associated disorders, such as chronic active gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, are inversely associated with Barrett's metaplasia.
