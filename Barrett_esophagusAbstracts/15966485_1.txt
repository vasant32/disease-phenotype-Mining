Barrett's esophagus is usually diagnosed by the endoscopic and histological finding of columnar epithelium with intestinal metaplasia in the distal esophagus. The prevalence of Barrett's esophagus (long segment) is <2% in the general population and 3-5% in patients with chronic reflux symptoms. Barrett mucosa predisposes patients to adenocarcinoma that develops in approximately 0.5% of these patients per year (Barrett mucosa --> dysplasia --> cancer sequence). The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma over the past few decades; the present incidence, however, is still rather low and is reported to be approximately 4 and approximately 0.5 per 100,000 in males and females, respectively. The malignant potential of the Barrett mucosa increases with dysplastic changes. Guidelines for surveillance and therapy are based on the presence and the degree of dysplastic lesions. Long-term studies on cost-effectiveness of these guidelines are, however, still missing.
