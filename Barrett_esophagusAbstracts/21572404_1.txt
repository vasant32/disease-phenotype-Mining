Adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction continues to rise in incidence. An intestinal metaplasia (Barrett esophagus)-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence induced by gastroesophageal reflux disease is well established. However, a significant number of adenocarcinomas in the vicinity of the esophagogastric junction are seen in the background of gastric/cardiac-type mucosa without intestinal metaplasia. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of Barrett esophagus (intestinal-type mucosa) in the classification and prognosis of tumors of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction. Clinicopathological and molecular characteristics were examined in 157 consecutively resected adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction and were compared between tumors arising in association with intestinal-type and cardiac-type mucosa. Intestinal-type mucosa-associated adenocarcinomas were more likely to be associated with younger age (P=0.0057), reflux symptoms (P<0.0001), proximal location (P=0.0009), lower T stage (P<0.0001), fewer nodal metastases (P=0.0001), absence of lymphatic (P<0.0001), venous (P=0.0060) or perineural (P<0.0001) invasion. Histologically, intestinal-type mucosa-associated tumors were more likely to be low-grade glandular tumors (P=0.0095) of intestinal or mixed immunophenotype (P=0.015) and express nuclear Î²-catenin (P=0.0080), whereas tumors arising in a background of cardiac-type mucosa were more frequently associated with EGFR amplification (P=0.0051). Five-year overall survival rate was significantly higher in patients with intestinal-type mucosa-associated tumors (28 vs 9%, P=0.0015), although no survival benefit was seen after adjusting for potential confounders. Our findings support the theory that multiple distinct pathways of tumorigenesis exist in the vicinity of the esophagogastric junction, including one in which tumors arise from dysplastic intestinal metaplasia (intestinal pathway), and one potentially involving dysplasia of the cardiac-type mucosa (non-intestinal pathway). Additional studies are warranted to further clarify their pathogenesis and the molecular mechanisms involved.
