The objective of this study was to investigate if esophageal bacteria are associated with Barrett's esophagus (BE). This study was comprised of a retrospective (Part 1) and a subsequent prospective (Part 2) study. In Part 1, Gram stains were performed on esophageal biopsy specimens obtained in 47 patients. Bacteria were quantitated from 0 to 4. In Part 2, Gram stains and cultured bacterial counts of esophageal biopsies were obtained in 18 GERD patients (9 with BE and 9 without BE). Part 1 results were as follows. Bacteria were found in 37 of 47 esophageal biopsies. Quantitative bacterial stain scores for BE (2.5 +/- 0.2) were higher than for non-BE (1.5 +/- 0.3; P = 0.02). The quantitative bacterial stain scores correlated with increasing severity of dysplasia (r = 0.37, P = 0.028). In Part 2, bacteria were found in 8 of 18 esophageal biopsies by Gram stain (6 of 9 patients with BE vs. 2 of 9 non-BE). The distal esophageal bacterial stain scores in BE patients (1.6 +/- 0.5) were higher than in those without BE (0.4 +/- 0.3; P = 0.07). Patients on proton pump inhibitors tended to have higher bacterial stain scores (1.2 +/- 0.4) than patients who were not (0.7 +/- 0.3; P = 0.45). Bacterial colony counts were similar in patients with BE compared to those without BE. In conclusion, bacteria in esophageal biopsies were detected more often in BE than non-BE. Increasing bacterial stain scores were associated with metaplasia and increasing dysplasia. Esophageal bacteria, possibly related to stasis or gastric acid suppression therapy, may play a role in the pathogenesis of BE and dysplasia.
