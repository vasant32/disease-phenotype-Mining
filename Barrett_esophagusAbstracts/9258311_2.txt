Short segment Barrett's esophagus (SSBE) is a frequent finding in patients having endoscopy, but its clinical significance is not fully understood. With the rising incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a potential role of SSBE has been suggested. Biopsy of such lesions may have to be done when seen on endoscopy.
