Artifacts related to barium flow during double-contrast esophagography may obscure mucosal surface details. Double-contrast esophagograms with flow artifacts of 35 patients were evaluated to determine the effect on radiographic interpretation and to assess the method of examination. Initial radiographs obtained during swallowing of barium were compared with those obtained after a slight delay while patients repeatedly dry swallowed. When severe surface flow artifacts were present, the extent of mucosal disease was underestimated in all cases. Mild surface flow artifacts interfered with the demonstration of the reticular pattern of Barrett esophagus, and luminal flow artifacts caused misinterpretation. The demonstration of strictures was unaffected by flow artifacts. This study suggests that the dry swallowing maneuver and some delay improve depiction of esophageal surface details on double-contrast radiographs and obviate interpretive error from barium flow artifacts.
