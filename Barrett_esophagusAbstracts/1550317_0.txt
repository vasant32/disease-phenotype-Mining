Fifty patients were reoperated for failed antireflux procedures or post-fundoplication symptoms. Cases of severe esophagitis, that is stenosis or Barrett's esophagus, were excluded. The usual cause of failure was a technical error. All of the operations, a new fundoplication in 35 cases and a total duodenal diversion in 15 cases, were performed via an abdominal incision. Operative mortality was nil. After a 42 months follow-up, according to the patient, the clinical results were good or excellent in 93% of the cases. The objective results-fibroscopy, pHmanometry, X-Ray were normal in 86%.
