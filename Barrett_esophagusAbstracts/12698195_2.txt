Barrett's oesophagus is a premalignant condition whose incidence is rising dramatically. Molecular markers are urgently needed to identify Barrett's patients at the highest risk of cancer progression. To this end, we have used a rapid molecular technique, restriction site mutation (RSM), to detect low-frequency mutations in the p53 tumour suppressor gene in premalignant Barrett's tissues of cancer-free patients. In total, 38 endoscopically diagnosed Barrett's patients with a range of histological stages of Barrett's progression, plus four control patients without Barrett's oesophagus, were analysed for early p53 mutations. Tissue samples taken from these patients (93 samples in total) were analysed for the presence of low-frequency p53 mutations at hotspot codons: 175, 213, 248, 249, 282. In total, 13 of the 38 Barrett's patients were shown to possess a p53 mutation in at least one sample (no mutations in the four control patients). Although no statistically significant associations were found, p53 mutations reflected histological progression in Barrett's patients with p53 mutations found in 30% of metaplasia patients (P=0.4) and low-grade dysplasia patients (P=0.33) and 45% of high-grade dysplasia patients (P=0.15). Detected p53 mutations were mainly GC to AT transitions at CpG sites.
