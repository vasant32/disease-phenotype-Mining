 AIM: To examine use of acid-decreasing medications, especially proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) with and without Barrett's oesophagus (BO) in a large-scale study. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed BO (ICD-9 code 5302) and patients with GERD and no BO (ICD-9 53081, 5301) in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) databases. Filled prescriptions for oral PPI and histamine2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) were identified in the VA Pharmacy Benefit Management database during 365 days following diagnosis. Groups with or without PPI or H2RA were compared in unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses. Chart review was used to validate diagnoses in a subset of patients with and without BO. RESULTS: We evaluated 7732 patients with BO and 13 457 with GERD and no BO diagnosed between 1/2000 and 12/2002. At least one PPI prescription was filled during the first year following diagnosis in 91.5% of BO and 61.4% of non-BO patients (P < 0.0001), and one H2RA in 31.7% of BO and 59.4% of non-BO patients (P < 0.0001), respectively. However, 6.1% of BO patients were prescribed neither. Median duration for PPI filled prescriptions was twice as long for BO (221.7 vs. 106.9 days) compared with non-BO patients. The ratio of PPI or H2RA filled prescription days to available follow-up days among BO subjects was 0.66 (122.8 days were not covered with prescription for either), and 0.55 in GERD patients with no BO (165.0 days on neither). CONCLUSIONS: Veterans Affairs patients with BO are 50% more likely to be prescribed a PPI than patients with GERD and no BO. However, on average, PPI prescriptions cover only 60% of follow-up time for BO patients.
