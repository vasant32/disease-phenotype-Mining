Primary esophageal adenocarcinoma is rare. Nineteen such cases treated in our hospital during 1972-1985 are reported. Of these patients, 15 were treated by surgery. Only one of them survived for more than 3 years. The prognosis was worse than that of the squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is of three origins: ectopic gastric mucosa, esophageal intrinsic gland, and Barrett's esophagus. In our series, only one case was proved to be due to malignancy of the Barrett's esophagus.
