 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Esophagogastric junctional lesions, such as mucosal breaks with Los Angeles grade A or B reflux esophagitis, lacerations in Mallory Weiss syndrome, and short segment Barrett's esophagus, are mainly found in the right anterior wall of the distal esophagus. Asymmetrical lower esophageal sphincter pressure and resting radial asymmetrical acid reflux may be causes of this asymmetrical distribution of reflux esophagitis and short segment Barrett's esophagus. We developed a novel pH and pressure catheter to investigate the asymmetrical distributions of pH and intra-esophageal pressure in the distal esophagus. METHODS: One healthy male volunteer was enrolled in this study. Acid reflux and motor function in distal esophagus was investigated using simultaneous measurements of intra-esophageal pH and pressure in 8 directions with novel sensor catheter. RESULTS: Thirty-six acid and weak acid reflux events were observed, of which 22 were circumferential refluxes with pH drops in all channels and 14 were partial refluxes with pH drops in some channels. Increase in transient circumferential intraesophageal pressure was observed just after 72.7% of the circumferential reflux and 42.9% of the partial reflux events. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel sensor catheter, 2 different types of acid reflux events were identified in the present study.
