No data are available on the localization of Pepsinogen A (PGA = PG I) and Pepsinogen C (PGC = PG II) positive cells in Barrett's epithelium. Endoscopic biopsy specimens were taken from the columnar epithelium from 23 patients (n = 93), and in addition from the cardia from eight healthy control subjects (n = 38). The tissue was stained by the immunoperoxidase technique with specific anti-pepsinogen antisera, and double immunostained for PGA and PGC. In the Barrett's epithelium PGA was found in 28 out of 93 biopsy specimens (30.1%) and PGC in 55 out of 93 (59.1%). Chief cells always stained both for PGA- and PGC +. PGA + and PGC + cells were found each in 100% of the biopsy specimens with fundic type epithelium, in 21.7% and 70.7% of biopsy specimens with junctional type, in 0% and 26.1% of biopsy specimens with specialized epithelium and in 12.5% and 43.5% of biopsy specimens with mixed junctional/specialized features respectively. Dysplastic epithelium stained always negatively with both anti-pepsinogen antisera. In most control cardia biopsy specimens PGA as well as PGC were demonstrable; occasionally clear mucous glands were PGA - and PGC+. It is concluded that pepsinogen-containing cells can be accurately identified in the Barrett's epithelium; their presence seems related to the histological cell type. Identification of pepsinogen positive cells may contribute to a more accurate morphological classification of the Barrett's epithelium.
