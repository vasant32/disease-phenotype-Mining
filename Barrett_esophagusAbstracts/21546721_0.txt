 BACKGROUND/AIM: Laparoscopic fundoplication can alter the natural course of Barrett's esophagus (BE). This study was undertaken to assess this role in patients with non-complicated BE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October 2004 to October 2009, 43 patients with BE (32 men and 11 women) underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication surgery in the Department of Surgery at Minia University Hospital. The median age of these patients was 46 years (range: 22-68 years). Patients with high-grade dysplasia, invasive cancer, or previous antireflux surgery were excluded. All 43 patients had gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. Heartburn was present in all patients, regurgitation in 41 (95.3%), dysphagia in 8 (18.6%), retrosternal pain in 30 (69.8%), upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 6 (13.9%), and respiratory symptoms in 19 (44.2%). Nissen fundoplication was performed in all patients. Thirty-four patients (79.1%) had concomitant hiatal hernia and nine patients (20.9%) had low-grade dysplasia. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 25.6 months. There was significant improvement of symptoms after surgery (P<0.05). Eight (18.6%) of those with short-segment BE had total regression and four (9.3%) of those with long-segment BE had a decrease in total length. Among the nine patients with preoperative low-grade dysplasia, dysplasia disappeared in seven, remained unchanged in one, and progressed to in situ adenocarcinoma in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: laparoscopic fundoplication succeeded in controlling symptoms but had unpredictable effect on dysplasia and regression of BE. Laparoscopic fundoplication does not eliminate the risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma and therefore, endoscopic follow-up should be continued in these patients.
