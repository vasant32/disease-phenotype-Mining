We report a rarely documented case of adenocarcinoma of esophagus with signet-ring cell features arising in a Barrett's esophagus. This was diagnosed by employing combined endosonography and fine-needle aspiration cytology. The patient had progressive dysphagia and a poorly circumscribed mass involving the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. An incisional biopsy was performed which showed Barrett's esophagus with highly atypical glands suspicious for adenocarcinoma. Following that, an ultrasound-guided endoscopic fine-needle aspiration revealed a cellular specimen with multiple groups and singly dispersed atypical glandular cells with a predominance of signet-rings features. These findings represented an adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell features arise in Barrett's esophagus.
