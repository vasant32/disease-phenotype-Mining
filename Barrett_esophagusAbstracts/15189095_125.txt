This study was performed to examine the usefulness of medical endoscopic imaging utilizing narrow-band illumination. The contrast between the vascular pattern and the adjacent mucosa of the underside of the human tongue was measured using five narrow-band illuminations and three broadband illuminations. The results demonstrate that the pathological features of a vascular pattern are dependent on the center wavelength and the bandwidth of illumination. By utilizing narrow-band illumination of 415+/-30 nm, the contrast of the capillary pattern in the superficial layer was markedly improved. This is an important benefit that is difficult to obtain with ordinary broadband illumination. The appearances of capillary patterns on color images were evaluated for three sets of filters. The narrow, band imaging (NBI) filter set (415+/-30 nm, 445+/-30 nm, 500+/-30 nm) was selected to achieve the preferred appearance of the vascular patterns for clinical tests. The results of clinical tests in colonoscopy and esophagoscopy indicated that NBI will be useful as a supporting method for observation of the endoscopic findings of early cancer.
