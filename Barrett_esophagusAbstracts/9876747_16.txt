 BACKGROUND: Recent advances in laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgery have made it possible to perform esophagectomy using minimally invasive techniques. The aim of this report was to present our preliminary experience with minimally invasive esophagectomy. METHODS: We reviewed our experience on eight patients who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy using either laparoscopic and/or thoracoscopic techniques from June 1996 to May 1997. Indications for esophagectomy included stage I carcinoma (5), palliative resection (1), Barrett's with high grade dysplasia (1) and end stage achalasia (1). RESULTS: The average age was 68 years (54-82). The surgical approach to esophagectomy included laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis (n = 4), thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis (n = 1), and laparoscopic mobilization with right mini-thoracotomy and intra-thoracic anastomosis (n = 3). Conversion to mini-laparotomy was required in two patients (25%) to complete esophageal dissection and facilitate gastric pull-up. The mean operative time was 460 minutes. The mean intensive care stay was 1.9 days (range of 0-7 days) with a mean hospital stay of 13.8 days. Minor complications included atrial fibrillation (n = 1), pleural effusion (n = 2) and persistent air leak (n = 1). Major complications included cervical anastomotic leak (n = 1), and delayed gastric emptying requiring pyloroplasty (n = 1). There was no perioperative mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary experience suggests that minimally invasive esophagectomy is safe and feasible in centers with experience in advanced minimally invasive surgical procedures. Further studies are necessary to determine advantages over open esophagectomy.
