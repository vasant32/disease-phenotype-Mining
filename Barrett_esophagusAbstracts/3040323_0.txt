Eight patients who had Barrett's oesophagus confirmed by histology are presented. All had barium swallow examinations and technetium-99m sodium pertechnetate (99Tcm-pertechnetate) scintigraphy, the findings of which are reviewed and discussed. The most valuable diagnostic signs on barium swallow examination related to the site of the stricture and the presence of mucosal outpouchings. Scintigraphy was positive in all eight cases. Patients suspected of having Barrett's oesophagus on barium swallow examination should undergo scintigraphy. When the latter is positive, the endoscopist should be alerted to obtain biopsies not only at the site of stricture but serially as far as the gastrooesophageal junction.
