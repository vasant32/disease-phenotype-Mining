Background: There is a need to evaluate the process of quality improvement in health care services. Aims: To determine quality indicators, frequencies into the registry of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies in a tertiary academic hospital in Mexico City. Material and methods: A retrospective, observational and transversal study was performed in the Specialty Hospital Dr. Antonio Fraga Mouret IMSS between July 2007 and June 2008. Registry of several quality indicators for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was sought. Results: A total of 485 endoscopic reports were included. The reason for upper endoscopy was as follows: Barrett's esophagus 161, esophageal dilation 133, gastric ulcer 82, peptic ulcer 120, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding 130. The indicators evaluated were: Informed consent 91.3%, complete examination 97.7%, Barrett's esophagus measured and biopsy specimens taken 85.7% y 96.2% respectively. Biopsy specimens were taken in gastric ulcer 87.8%. Description and localization of upper gastrointestinal lesion 99.2%, ulcer haemostatic treatment 98.2%, and haemostasis documented 94.6%, proton pump inhibitors were recommended to patients undergone esophageal dilation and peptic ulcer 80.3% y 29.2% respectively. Conclusions: Registry frequencies of quality indicators were high for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, completeness of examination and Barrett's oesophagus. Pharmacological treatment recommendation in peptic disease is an area that has to be improved. It was not possible to establish either the indicator or only its register was omitted.
