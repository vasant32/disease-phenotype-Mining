 INTRODUCTION: Barrett's esophagus undergoes malignant transformation in 0.5-1% of patients per year following the sequence of low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. The aim of the present study was to present our experience in the surgical treatment of Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Of a group of 128 patients with a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus, 8 (6.2%) developed high-grade dysplasia during a median follow-up of 7 years (2-25). A further 5 patients with high-grade dysplaing out side the study were referred for evaluation and surgical treatment. Eight patients were under medical treatment with omeprazole (40 mg daily) while the remaining 5 patients had undergone open Nissen fundoplication, with a diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia at a median of 5 years (1-16) after treatment initiation. After confirmation of the diagnosis by a second pathologist and tumoral staging, transthoracic esophagectomy with anastomosis at the apex of the thorax was performed in all patients. RESULTS: Postoperative mortality was nil. Morbidity was 36% (5 patients). Definitive histological analysis of the surgical specimen revealed high-grade dysplasia in 7 patients (54%) and adenocarcinoma in 6 (46%). All patients remain alive after a median follow-up of 4.7 years (1-14). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia, the best therapeutic option is surgical resection, which can be performed with nil mortality in experienced centers. In almost half of surgical patients, the surgical specimen shows adenocarcinoma. Five-year survival is higher than 90%.
