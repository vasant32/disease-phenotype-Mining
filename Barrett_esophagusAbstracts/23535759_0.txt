Total esophagogastric disconnection (TED) is an alternative surgical procedure in resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease. We report two severe not yet described long-term complications of TED occurring in 4 children with a past history of esophageal atresia. Three children presented with stenosis of the esophagojejunal anastomosis 5 months to 9 years after TED requiring repeated dilations associated with mitomycin C application in one of them. Barrett's esophagus was observed in 3 children 8 to 9 years after TED. Careful long-term clinical and endoscopic follow-up of children who underwent TED is required.
