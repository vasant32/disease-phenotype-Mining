We evaluated diffuse reflectance spectroscopy implemented as a small field-of-view technique for discrimination of dysplasia from metaplasia in Barrett's esophagus as an adjuvant to autofluorescence endoscopy. Using linear discriminant analysis on 2579 spectra measured in 54 patients identified an optimum a 4-wavelength classifier (at 485, 513, 598 and 629 nm). Sensitivity and specificity for a test data set were 0.67 and 0.85, respectively. Spectroscopic results show that this technique could be implemented in wide-field imaging mode to improve the accuracy of existing endoscopy techniques for finding early pre-malignant lesions in Barrett's esophagus. Results show that the discrimination occurs likely due to redistribution of blood content in the tissue sensed by the optical probing with the wavelength-dependent sampling depth.
