A variety of premalignant lesions, including Barrett's esophagus, colonic polyps, ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, intraductal mucin secreting papillomatosis are now well recognized and accessible to direct endoscopic assessment and biopsy or brushing. This review emphasizes the potential usefulness of genetic markers, in particular Ki-ras oncogene and p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations, in the endoscopic surveillance of these premalignant conditions. The adjunction of Ki-ras and p53 assays in material collected during endoscopic procedures may help the clinician detect earlier and with a higher accuracy neoplastic progression.
