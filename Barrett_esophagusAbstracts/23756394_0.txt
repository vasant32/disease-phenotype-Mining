Esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence is rapidly increasing which may be due to the growing incidence of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and obesity. The mechanisms linking obesity and progression of Barrett's carcinogenesis is poorly understood. The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of adipokines receptors in BE and in normal squamous epithelium in the same patients in correlation with obesity parameters. Methods: Expression of adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 protein (AdipoR1, AdipoR2) as well as leptin receptor protein (ObR) in biopsies from 27 BE and normal squamous epithelium (N) in the same patients as well as in obese and normal controls were assessed with Western-blot analysis. These correlations were confirmed with the quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). AdipoR1 and ObR protein levels were similar in BE mucosa and squamous epithelium in the same patients in Western-blot analysis (2303 vs. 2448 OB units; 106927 vs. 103390, respectively; p>0.05). RT-PCR analysis confirmed this observation for AdipoR1, R2 and ObR genes expression (0.11±0.08 vs. 0.19±0.24, p=0.78; 0.24±0.36 vs. 0.33±0.49, p=0.5375; 0.71±0.8 vs. 1.33±2.95, p=1.0; respectively). Using linear correlation analysis we found the positive correlation between AdipoR1 expression in Barrett's epithelium compared to squamous epithelium in the same patients (N) (r=0.5; p=0.008) and between ObR expression in BE and N (r=0.8; p<0.001). The AdipoR1 and ObR protein levels were significantly higher in BE patients compared to controls and obese controls (2303 vs. 895 vs. 1674 and OD units, p<0.05). Conclusions: in opposite to the prior hypothesis adiponectin and leptin receptors activation in BE may be not caused by obesity.
