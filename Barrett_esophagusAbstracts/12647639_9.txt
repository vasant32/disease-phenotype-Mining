 BACKGROUND: It has been reported that there are four zones of distinct venous patterns around the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ); i.e. truncal, perforating, palisade (PZ) and gastric zones. Using the distal end of PZ as a marker for GEJ, this study was done to assess the length and patterns of PZ in Koreans, and to assess the prevalence of endoscopic Barrett's esophagus (E-BE) and hiatal hernia (E-HH). METHODS: 847 consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic endoscopy were included. During endoscopy, PZ, squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) and pinchcock action (PCA) were identified. Patterns were classified according to the relationships of the distal end of PZ with SCJ and PCA; A: all three at the same level, B: SCJ proximal to the other two which are at the same level, C: PCA distal to the other two which are at the same level, D: SCJ proximal to the distal end of PZ which is proximal to PCA. Cases with patterns B and D were thought to have E-BE, and those with patterns C and D to have E-HH. RESULTS: Patterns A, B, C and D were 79.2%, 12.1%, 3.8% and 4.9%, respectively. Length of PZ was 3.0 +/- 0.1 cm. E-BE and E-HH were found in 17.0% and 8.7%, respectively. Both E-BE and E-HH were more frequently found in males and in cases with reflux esophagitis. CONCLUSION: E-BE and E-HH are not so infrequent in Koreans as previously thought, if we use the distal end of PZ as an endoscopic marker of GEJ.
