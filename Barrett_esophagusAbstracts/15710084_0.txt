Resistance to proton pump inhibitors (PPI) in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which has been described in patients treated with omeprazole, could explain some exceptional cases of treatment failure and the need for surgery. The objective test of resistance to PPI is obtained with 24-hour intragastric pH-metry performed during treatment. A gastric pH of less than 4 for more than 50% of recording time indicates resistance. We present a patient with non-erosive GERD and treatment failure to omeprazole and proven resistance to esomeprazole which, to our knowledge, has only been reported in patients with Barrett's esophagus.
