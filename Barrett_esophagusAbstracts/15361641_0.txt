Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC) is a rare form of cancer that arises primarily in the upper aerodigestive tract. Esophageal BSCC is extremely rare, accounting for less than 2% of primary esophageal malignancies. It is histopathologically distinct from squamous cell carcinoma and has an aggressive biological behavior with poor survival outcomes. There is no known association of Barrett's esophagus with esophageal BSCC. Here, we report what we believe is the first such case of esophageal BSCC occurring in the setting of Barrett's esophagus.
