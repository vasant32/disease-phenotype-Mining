Pathologic evidence of gastroesophageal reflux demonstrated by either Barrett's esophagus or esophagitis was present in 33% of patients undergoing laryngopharynoesophagectomy, while secondary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas were present in 25% of the specimens. Overall, 54% of all the patients undergoing laryngopharyngoesophagectomy had esophageal disease. This incidence of reflux and secondary esophageal malignant neoplasia is higher than in the general population. Careful assessment of the patient's preoperative history for gastroesophageal reflux, contrast swallowing studies, and esophagoscopies correctly diagnosed most but not all of the esophageal lesions found on pathologic examination. Interestingly, all of the esophageal carcinomas removed in the laryngopharyngoesophagectomy specimens were small and sometimes not evident clinically. Although gastroesophageal reflux has been postulated as an additional etiologic agent in the development of laryngeal carcinoma, all the patients in our study had heavy alcohol and tobacco consumption, and therefore reflux could not be evaluated separately as a risk factor.
