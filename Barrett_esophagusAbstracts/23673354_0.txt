BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although patients with patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) commonly undergo endoscopic surveillance, its effectiveness in reducing mortality from esophageal/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas (EAs) has not been rigorously evaluated. METHODS: We performed a case-control study in a community-based setting. Among 8272 members with BE, we identified 351 EAs-70 in persons who had a prior diagnosis of BE (who were eligible for surveillance); 51 of these patients died, 38 as a result of the cancers (cases). Surveillance histories were contrasted with a sample of 101 living persons with BE (controls), matched for age, sex, and duration of follow-up. RESULTS: Surveillance within 3 y was not associated with a decreased risk of death from EA, (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-2.75). Fatal cases were nearly as likely to have received surveillance (55.3%) as were controls (60.4%). A BE length >3 cm and prior dysplasia were each associated with subsequent mortality, but adjustment for these did not change the main findings. Although all patients should be included in evaluations of effectiveness, excluding deaths related to cancer treatment and patients who failed to complete treatment, changed the magnitude, but not the significance, of the association (OR=0.46; 95% CI 0.13-1.64). CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic surveillance of patients with BE was not associated with a substantially decreased risk of death from EA. The results do not exclude a small to moderate benefit. However, if such a benefit exists, our findings indicate that it is substantially smaller than currently estimated. The effectiveness of surveillance was partially influenced by the acceptability of existing treatments and the occurrence of treatment-associated mortality.
