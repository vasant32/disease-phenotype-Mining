 BACKGROUND: The origin of intestinal metaplasia at the esophagogastric junction has clinical importance. However, it can be difficult to differentiate between intestinal metaplasia of short-segment Barrett's esophagus and cardiac intestinal metaplasia due to Helicobacter pylori infection. Specific patterns of cytokeratin (CK)7 and CK20 have been detected in long-segment Barrett's esophagus. The aim of the present study was to assess the immunostaining patterns associated with short-segment Barrett's esophagus. AIMS: Paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens were prepared from 128 patients with intestinal metaplasia of long-segment Barrett's esophagus (n = 3), short-segment Barrett's esophagus without H. pylori infection (n = 22), short-segment Barrett's esophagus with H. pylori infection (n = 22), and cardiac mucosa (n = 49) and gastric mucosa from antrum and fundus (n = 44) with H. pylori infection. Sections were prepared and immunostained for CK7 and CK20. RESULT: A Barrett's CK7/20 pattern was present in all three patients (100%) with long-segment Barrett's esophagus, 21 of 22 patients (95%) with short-segment Barrett's esophagus without H. pylori infection, and six of 22 patients (27%) with short-segment Barrett's esophagus with H. pylori infection (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Intestinal metaplasia of short-segment Barrett's esophagus in patients without H. pylori infection is thought to be similar to that seen in long-segment Barrett's esophagus.
