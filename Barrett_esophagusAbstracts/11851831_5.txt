BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An increased prevalence of reflux esophagitis has been reported following Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in patients with duodenal ulcers in Western countries. However, it has remained unknown whether this might also appertain to individuals with other diseases. We therefore carried out this study to determine the effect of eradicating H. pylori infection in a series of Japanese patients. METHODS: Of a total of 203 H. pylori-positive patients successfully cured of infection, 82 cases (58 males, 24 females) with gastric disease, but not duodenal ulcers, were included in the present study; median age 56 years (range 18-80) and median follow up of 24 months (range 6-65). The patients were investigated clinically and endoscopically at regular intervals. RESULTS: Mild reflux esophagitis developed after eradication in three of 55 (5.5%) patients formerly without this condition, while it improved after eradication in five of 27 (18.5%) patients, with the disease endoscopically diagnosed prior to eradication. The estimated incidence of esophagitis within 3 years was 4.8% after cure of infection. Short segment Barrett's esophagus developed after eradication in six of 58 (10.3%) patients who did not have it prior to the therapy, while the condition did not improve in 24 patients affected before eradication. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic esophageal changes after H. pylori eradication in the present series of Japanese patients were relatively infrequent and mild. This therapeutic approach thus appears to be safe and unproblematic.
