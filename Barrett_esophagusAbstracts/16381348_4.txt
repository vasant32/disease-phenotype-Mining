 OBJECTIVE: Esophagectomy is an operation with high morbidity and mortality. Its adoption as a minimally invasive operation worldwide has been slow, but the potential benefits of reducing the trauma of surgery need to be considered. Our 30-month experience with transhiatal esophagectomy in a district general hospital is presented herein. METHODS: Patients were considered for surgery after radiological staging had excluded inoperable disease. Laparoscopic staging was initially performed. Patients with tumors of the esophagus and high-grade dysplasia in a Barrett's esophagus were included. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were referred for consideration for resectional surgery. Nine underwent outpatient laparoscopy only. Twenty patients (age range, 34 to 78, 15 males:5 females) underwent resectional surgery. Seventeen transhiatal resections were completed, 2 were converted to open procedures, and 1 transhiatal resection of a benign tumor was performed. Median time of surgery was 415 minutes (range, 320 to 480) and blood loss was 300 mL (range, 200 to 350). The median length of post-operative ventilation and critical care stay were 1 (range, 1 to 4) and 4 (range, 2 to 8) days. Median duration of hospitalization was 17 days (range, 10 to 28). Thirty-day mortality was 0; 1 patient who was converted to an open procedure died after a cerebrovascular event on day 34. CONCLUSION: A zero mortality rate for laparoscopic resection and a low-morbidity rate compare well with morbidity and mortality in reported series using this method and open surgery. Laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy is an advanced, complex procedure that can be performed safely in a district general hospital setting.
