The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation between hiatal hernia and gastro-oesophageal reflux and related histological abnormalities in patients without endoscopic oesophagitis. A consecutive series of 78 patients with a history of gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms and hiatal hernia, as defined by videofluorography combined with a water siphon test, underwent oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and multiple biopsies. Hiatal hernia was confirmed endoscopically in 99% of cases. The water siphon test was positive for reflux in 72% of cases. At endoscopy 42% of patients had oesophagitis and/or Barrett's oesophagus and 58% had no lesions. In the group without endoscopic lesions, at histology oesophagitis-related alterations were found in 98% and intestinal metaplasia in 27%. In conclusion, this study shows that symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux patients with radiologically defined hiatal hernia should undergo endoscopy with multiple biopsies above the squamocolumnar junction, even when endoscopy is normal. This is in order to detect histological gastro-oesophageal-reflux-related alterations, above all, when a positive water siphon test is also present, owing to its known correlation with intestinal metaplasia.
