Initial data from the first nine hospitals registering at least 50 patients each with UKBOR were analysed. This involved 2102 Barrett's oesophagus (BO) cases (M1261:F841), mean 234 patients per centre (range 73-636) and M:F ratio 1.5 (range 1.1-2.3). There was an equal geographical distribution of the hospitals, three each in the north of the country (N), Midlands (Mid) and the south of the country (S). The catchment populations varied from 145,000 to 450,000. The M:F ratio for N, Mid and S was 1.6, 1.3, 1.7, respectively. The mean age at diagnosis in males was 62.0 years (range 53.2-66.3) and in females 67.6 years (range 59.3-73.4), with little geographical variation. The age distribution varied somewhat between the centres; the peak age for males being 40-49 years in one northern hospital, 60-69 years in seven others and 70-79 years in one hospital. For females it was 60-69 years and 70-79 years in each of four hospitals, and 80-89 years in one. The BO diagnosis rate in the under 50s was fairly constant; F mean 14% (range 0-23%); M (eight centres) mean 23% (range 16-27%). However, in one northern centre it was much higher (43%). Information on patients with a diagnosis of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (AC) was available from seven centres. A total of 59 AC were diagnosed (M44:F15, ratio 2.9). The overall mean rate of AC in BO was 3.6% (range 0.5-7.5%). Minor variations in BO patient characteristics may have been due to the hospitals' different policies on diagnostic and reporting criteria. However, the much higher percentage of men under age 50 in the one N centre may reflect a genuine difference in diet and lifestyle, or possibly genetic susceptibility.
