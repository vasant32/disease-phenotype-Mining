The pepsinogen A (PGA) isozymogens in the gastric mucosa and Barrett epithelium of a female patient with Barrett esophagus were studied on different occasions during a 3-year period by electrophoretic analysis of in vivo steady-state pepsinogen in biopsies by activity staining in combination with variant specific monoclonal antibodies and of de novo synthesized pepsinogen by autoradiography. In Barrett epithelium only one (Pg3) or two (Pg3 and Pg5) primary PGA gene products were detected, whereas in gastric mucosal biopsies three (Pg3, Pg4 and Pg5) primary gene products were demonstrated on all occasions. These differences strongly suggest differential expression/activation of individual gene numbers in the PGA gene cluster in Barrett esophagus and are in line with the preneoplastic nature of this condition. The mechanism behind this deregulation is currently under investigation by cell biology and molecular genetic techniques.
