 BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy, radical lymphadenectomy and treatment in high-volume centres have been proposed to improve outcomes for resectable oesophageal tumours. The aim of the present study was to review the oesophagectomy experience of a single surgeon with a moderate caseload who uses neoadjuvant therapy selectively and performs a conservative lymphadenectomy. METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was performed. The study included 125 consecutive attempted oesophageal resections performed by a single surgeon (RC) from 1993 to 2006. RESULTS: All patients were staged with computed tomography and also laparoscopy for lower third and junctional tumours. Endoscopic ultrasound was used in 69%. Seventy-seven per cent were adenocarcinomas. Neoadjuvant therapy was used selectively in 23%. One hundred and twenty-one resections were carried out, giving an overall resection rate of 97% with an R0 resection in 82%. In-hospital mortality was 0.8%, clinical anastomotic leak 1.7% and median length of stay 14 days. Overall median and 5-year survival were 46 months and 47%. Stage-specific 5-year survival was 100%, 71%, 41% and 21% for stages 0, I, II and III, respectively. Isolated local recurrence occurred in 8%. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate volume surgeon with specialist training in oesophageal resectional surgery can achieve a low mortality and anastomotic leak rate with good survival outcomes. The role for neoadjuvant therapy and radical lymphadenectomy is controversial and remains to be clearly defined. Accurate preoperative staging is essential for selection of patients for curative surgery with or without neoadjuvant therapy and for comparison of results.
