Using a Collis-Nissen repair instead of a standard Nissen fundoplication to treat the reflux disease of Barrett's esophagus is controversial. This paper compares the Nissen and Collis-Nissen operations when treating Barrett's esophagus. Thirty-three patients with documented Barrett's esophagus (male : female, 26 : 7, median age, 48.8 years) had a Nissen fundoplication during 1976-1989. Fifty-one patients (male : female = 41 : 10, median age = 53.2 years) underwent a Collis-Nissen operation between 1990 and 1999. Clinical assessments, esophagogram, radionuclide emptying, manometry, 24-h pH study, and endoscopy were obtained pre- and postoperatively. There was no operative death in either group. Median follow-up was 8.0 years for the Nissen group and 6.5 years for the Collis group. Postoperative reflux symptoms were more frequent in the Nissen group (52%) when compared to the Collis group (7%, P < 0.001). These symptoms correlated with the 24-h pH recordings revealing an increased acid exposure in the Nissen group (3.4%) as opposed to 1% in the Collis group (P = 0.003). Endoscopy revealed mucosal erosions and ulcers in 39% of patients receiving a standard Nissen repair while these damages were seen in 7% of patients who were offered an elongation gastroplasty with a total fundoplication (P = 0.007). The cumulative success rate was 83% for the Nissen group and 100% for the Collis group at 5 years, and 63% versus 90% at 10 years (Log-rank test, P = 0.004). The Collis-Nissen fundoplication provides better reflux protection for Barrett's patients than a standard Nissen repair. It lowers the risk of fundoplication failure.
