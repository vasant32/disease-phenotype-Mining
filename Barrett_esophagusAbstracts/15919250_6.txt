 BACKGROUND: A significant percentage of patients with Barrett's oesophagus (BE) will continue to manifest abnormal intra-oesophageal pH profiles regardless of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. AIMS: We conducted a prospective study in order to determine whether a change in PPI therapy would alter intra-oesophageal and intra-gastric acid suppression in BE patients. PATIENTS: Seventeen Helicobacter pylori-negative BE patients (16 males, 1 female; mean+/-S.D. age, 63.5+/-13.2). METHODS: Twenty-four-hour pH monitoring was performed on omeprazole or lansoprazole, followed by repeat pH monitoring on rabeprazole at a dose titrated for symptom relief. Patients completed validated symptom and health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) surveys while on and off therapy. RESULTS: Ten (59%) of the 17 patients had abnormal baseline intra-oesophageal pH profiles. Oesophageal pH monitoring values on rabeprazole were abnormal in five out of five (100%) of the omeprazole cohort and three out of five (60%) of the lansoprazole cohort that had abnormal pH profiles on initial testing. Intra-gastric pH control was inadequate in BE patients on all PPIs; the mean percentage time with intra-gastric pH below 4.0 was 46% on omeprazole, 71% on lansoprazole and 51% on rabeprazole (p=0.25). All of the patients demonstrated the phenomenon of nocturnal acid breakthrough while undergoing PPI therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Change in PPI therapy did not alter intra-oesophageal or intra-gastric control in patients with BE.
