Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has become a popular bariatric restrictive procedure in the USA. The increasing popularity of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band procedure could, in part, be related to the lower cost and lower morbidity compared with laparoscopic gastric bypass. Although its placement is related to a lower number of perioperative complications compared with laparoscopic gastric bypass, its morbidity may be substantial. Barrett's esophagus or esophageal intestinal metaplasia is a known complication of chronic gastro-esophageal reflux disease that, in rare occasions, progresses to dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Barrett's esophagus, after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding placement, is a rare but not unexpected complication after gastric band placement. The incidence of Barrett's esophagus after adjustable gastric banding is not known. We present a case of Barrett's esophagus as a result of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding placement due to a chronically and highly restrictive gastric band in a former morbidly obese patient.
