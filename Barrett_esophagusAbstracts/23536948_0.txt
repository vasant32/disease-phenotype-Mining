 AIM: To study the prevalence and clinical aspects of Barrett's esophagus (BE) in natives and newcomers in East Siberia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Clinical examinations and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were performed in 12975 Caucasoids and 1489 Khakases in Abakan (Khakasia), 1861 Caucasoids and 5829 Tuvinians in Kyzyl (Republic of Tuva), and 1177 Caucasoids in Dudinka (Taimyr). The diagnosis of BE was verified by morphological study. RESULTS: Among the Caucasoids, the total prevalence of BE was 1.6% (2.4% in men and 0.8% in women; odds ratio (OR) was 3.21 with 95% CI 2.40-4.29; p < 0.001); among the Mongoloids, that was 3.1% (4.5% in men and 2% in women; OR, 2.3 with 95% CI 1.75-3.04; p < 0.001). Heartburn and other typical symptoms was more prevalent in patients with BE. The risk factors of BE in all the examined populations were male sex, age over 40 years, smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years or more in men, and obesity. CONCLUSION: There were ethnic differences in the prevalence of BE, which were prevalent in East Siberia in the Mongoloids as compared to the Caucasoids.
