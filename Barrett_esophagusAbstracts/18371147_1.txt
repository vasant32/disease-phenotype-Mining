Barrett's-associated esophageal adenocarcinoma (BEAC) is an important health concern in many western populations owing to its increasing incidence and the paucity of effective treatments. Statins have recently been suggested to induce anticancer effects against a variety of cancers in several, but not all, in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiologic studies. In the accompanying article by Ogunwobi and Beales, three statins were shown to inhibit proliferation and stimulate apoptosis in two EAC cell lines. These effects were achieved by reducing Ras, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and protein kinase B (Akt)-related cellular signaling. Although these results are promising, they are clearly preliminary, and much additional work is needed to confirm or refute the potential anticancer effects of statins in human BEAC. In addition, the work of Ogunwobi and Beales highlights the importance of developing better, more predictive in vitro and in vivo models of BEAC, and of taking promising, low-risk agents, such as statins, into early-phase therapeutic and preventive clinical trials involving cancer patients and patients with Barrett's metaplasia/dysplasia, respectively.
