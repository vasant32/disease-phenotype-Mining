Barrett's esophagus (BE) is an acquired disorder associated with a high incidence of adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus. Moreover, it has been reported that short-segment BE may be associated with adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction. The objective of this study was to define the prevalence of BE and the mucin profile in BE, including the short-segment type, and to compare the mucin profile in BE with the profiles of Barrett's adenocarcinoma and distal esophageal adenocarcinoma among Japanese. In total, 650 adult subjects underwent endoscopic examination for evaluation of BE. Although the prevalence of traditional (long segment) BE was 0.62%, the overall prevalence of BE including short-segment type was 15.7%. In Barrett's epithelium, the short-segment type predominantly had gastric type mucin, while the middle- and long-segment types possessed intestinal mucin, especially colonic type mucin (sulfo-Lewis(a)), with high frequency. In Barrett's epithelium with adenocarcinoma, all Barrett's epithelium adjacent to carcinomas showed a predominance of immunoreactivity to sulfo-Lewis(a). In Barrett's adenocarcinomas, colonic type mucin was detected in 100% by monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 91.9H. Small-intestinal mucin and gastric mucin were stained in 50% and 12.5% of the subjects, respectively. Colonic type mucin was also detected with high frequency (80%) in distal esophageal adenocarcinomas without Barrett's epithelium. These data suggest that the epitope, not of small-intestinal type or gastric type mucin, but of colonic type mucin (sulfo-Lewis(a)), may be associated with, at least in part, the malignant phenotype of BE.
