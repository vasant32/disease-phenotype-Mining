A patient is presented with Barrett's esophagus (lower esophagus lined with columnar epithelium) who also has a band of columnar epithelium in the upper esophagus separated from that below by normal squamous epithelium in the midesophagus. The upper most squamocolumnar junction coincided with or formed a mucosal ring as seen at endoscopy. This ring, which was first seen on barium swallow, has the radiographic appearance of that associated with the Paterson-Kelly syndrome. This patient's unique findings may provide further insight into the etiology of upper esophageal webs or rings (Paterson-Kelly syndrome).
