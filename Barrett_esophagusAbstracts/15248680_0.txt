OBJECTIVE: To examine the occurence and outcomes of African babies born with features of Eagle-Barret syndrome at a tertiary health centre. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University Teaching Hospital, Yaounde, Cameroon. SUBJECTS: Patients were identified through a retrospective review of obstetric records of mothers admitted at the centre within the period 1984 to 1996 inclusive. A total of eleven cases were identified over a period of thirteen years. RESULTS: The most prominent associated defects consisted of clubfoot, pulmonary hypoplasia, Potter's facies, imperforate anus and arthrogryposis. None of our patients survived the perinatal period. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates the need for the establishment of a prenatal and cytogenetic infrastructure in Cameroon to enhance early detection of congenital malformation and chromosomal aberrations. In the meantime, early detection of foetuses with Eagle-Barret syndrome using ultrasound could facilitate timely institutions of antenatal management options and lead to favourable birth outcomes of affected babies.
