Duodenogastric reflux is the retrograde flow of duodenal contents into the stomach that then mix with acid and pepsin. These agents can reflux into the esophagus (ie, duodenogastroesophageal reflux ) and cause gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications, including stricture, Barrett's esophagus, and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Medical and surgical treatments of DGER can be difficult. Best medical treatment is proton-pump inhibitors, which decrease DGER by inhibiting both gastric acidity and volume, making less gastric contents available to reflux into the esophagus. The addition of the gamma-aminobutyric (GABA(B)) receptor agonist baclofen may further reduce DGER in patients not responding to proton-pump inhibitors. Bile acid-binding agents (aluminum-containing antacids, cholestyramine, sucralfate, urosodeoxycholic acid) have physiologic rationale, but their efficacy is unproven. Prokinetic agents can reduce DGER and its upper gastrointestinal symptoms by promoting increased gastric emptying. In patients with medically refractory symptoms, a Roux-en-Y diversion or duodenal switch operation may be helpful.
