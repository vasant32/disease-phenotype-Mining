BACKGROUND: There is a significant interobserver and intraobserver variation in grading dysplasia in Barrett's metaplasia. New markers are needed to optimize the assessment of potential risk of cancer development in these patients. The aim of this study is to explore the use of p53 as a marker of neoplastic progression in Barrett's metaplasia. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to study p53 protein accumulation in 114 specimens from 54 patients with Barrett's metaplasia. RESULTS: Positive staining was found in 0% of the cases negative for dysplasia, 9% of those with low-grade dysplasia, 55% of those with high-grade dysplasia, and 87% of those with adenocarcinoma. Follow-up was available on 24 patients. Two patients who showed low-grade dysplasia and who were positive for p53 on biopsy showed high-grade dysplasia in follow-up biopsies. Of 21 patients who had biopsy specimens negative of p53, only one showed high-grade dysplasia on subsequent biopsy specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that p53 plays an important role in the progression of Barrett's metaplasia to adenocarcinoma. The follow-up study indicates that positive immunostaining for p53 may be an objective marker of neoplastic progression in Barrett's metaplasia.
