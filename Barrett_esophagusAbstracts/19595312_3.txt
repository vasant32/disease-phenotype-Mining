 BACKGROUND: The major risk factors for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma remain long-standing GERD and resultant Barrett's esophagus (BE). Finding the exact method of adequate tissue sampling for surveillance of dysplasia in BE remains a dilemma. OBJECTIVE: We prospectively compared standard large-capacity biopsy forceps with a new jumbo biopsy forceps for dysplasia detection in BE. SETTING/DESIGN: Prospective, single-center investigation. PATIENTS/INTERVENTIONS: We prospectively enrolled 32 patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy for BE. Biopsy samples were obtained in paired fashion alternating between the experimental (jumbo) and control (large-capacity) forceps. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Each sample was assessed for histopathology, specimen size, and adequacy. RESULTS: A total of 712 specimens were available for analysis for this investigation. Six patients were found to have dysplasia, and in 5 of those patients, the dysplasia was only detected with the jumbo forceps. The mean width was significantly greater in the Radial Jaw 4 jumbo group (3.3 mm vs 1.9 mm [P < .005]) as was the mean depth (2.0 mm vs 1.1 mm [P < .005]). Sixteen percent of samples obtained with the standard forceps provided an adequate sample, whereas the jumbo forceps provided an adequate sample 79% of the time (P < .05). LIMITATIONS: A lack of a validated index for assessment of tissue adequacy in BE. CONCLUSION: The Radial Jaw 4 jumbo biopsy forceps significantly improves dysplasia detection and adequate tissue sampling in patients undergoing endoscopy for BE.
