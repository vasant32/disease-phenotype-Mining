Between 1973 and 1990, 285 patients with Barrett's esophagus were treated at the Lahey Clinic. Of these patients, 73 had adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus either when first seen or while under surveillance. Of the remaining 212 patients with benign Barrett's esophagus, 30 had endoscopic evidence of a Barrett's ulcer, for a prevalence of 14%. Initial treatment consisted of aggressive medical therapy, including H2 antagonists and antacids as well as the usual dietary and antireflux measures. In 2 to 4 months, 27 patients underwent repeat endoscopy. Continued endoscopic evaluation in this group totaled 109 patient-years, with a range of 2 months to 13 years (median 2.3 years). Complete healing occurred in 23 of the 27 patients (85%) in 2 to 14 months (median 4 months). Recurrent ulcers developed in seven patients, and these ulcers healed with further medical therapy in five patients. Antireflux procedures were performed in four of six patients with nonhealing Barrett's ulcers, 1 to 1.5 cm in size, and all healed. Two patients refused to have an operation. In our experience, the majority of Barrett's ulcers heal with medical therapy. We reserve surgical intervention for otherwise suitable candidates for operation when no evidence of healing is found within 4 months of medical therapy or for the complications of Barrett's ulcer, namely, perforation, uncontrollable hemorrhage, or malignant degeneration, which were not encountered in this series.
