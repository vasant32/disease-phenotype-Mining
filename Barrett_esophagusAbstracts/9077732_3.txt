We report a case of a synchronous primary small-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus with ectopic gastrin and calcitonin production. The double primary carcinomas appeared to arise from dysplastic Barrett's mucosa in a 43-year-old woman with a long history of reflux esophagitis. She is one of the few reported long-term survivors treated by surgical resection and combination chemotherapy. The histopathology and treatment of this rare tumor are briefly discussed.
