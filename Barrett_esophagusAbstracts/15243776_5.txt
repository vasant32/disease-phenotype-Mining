The colonic segment is the most frequently used material for replacing the esophagus in children; however, the use of a gastric tube has become a reliable alternative operation. Since 1987, we have used an isoperistaltic gastric tube to replace the esophagus in children, and we present a series of 21 patients. Indications for operation included caustic injury (nine), esophageal atresia (eight), peptic stricture (two), congenital stricture (one), and esophageal duplication (one). There was no death or necrosis of the graft during the early postoperative period. The esophagogastric anastomosis leaked in two cases, but both of them closed spontaneously. A temporary dumping syndrome was encountered in two children. Two patients had strictures of their upper anastomosis responding to dilatations. The two patients who had a pharyngogastric anastomosis developed either intractable stricture or nonfunctioning anastomosis. One of them died 9 months later from aspiration pneumonitis. At follow-up, 16 of 21 patients could accept a normal diet (13 were entirely asymptomatic, and three suffered occasional mild dysphagia). Two patients suffered significant dysphagia (one had a durable dilation of his gastric tube), and three needed a feeding jejunostomy. Acid secretion of the gastric tube was proved in nine cases. Two patients were shown to have cervical Barrett's esophagus above the anastomosis. These findings indicate the need for lifelong endoscopic follow-up for these patients.
