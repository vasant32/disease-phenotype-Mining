Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux. Barrett's esophagus is a well-established risk factor for adenocarcinoma. There is no effective method available to prevent the malignant transformation of Barrett's esophagus. Endoscopy is therefore the only means of patients' screening and monitoring. Endoscopic surveillance is recommended to detect precancerous or cancerous lesions at an early stage, where curative treatment can be proposed.
