 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Endoscopic eradication therapy is frequently used to treat dysplasia and early cancers in Barrett's esophagus. This review addresses some of the recent developments in the field of endoscopic eradication therapy for Barrett's esophagus. RECENT FINDINGS: Data on the effectiveness of Barrett's esophagus ablation programs have been published recently, with excellent results for dysplasia eradication. Studies describing long-term results have shed light on the durability of endoscopic ablation, with recurrence of Barrett's esophagus and neoplasia seen in some cases, particularly at the gastroesophageal junction. Risk factors for failed ablation include longer Barrett's esophagus segments and persistent gastroesophageal reflux. New developments include studies combining radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and endoscopic mucosal resection into a single endoscopic session, endoscopic submucosal dissection for Barrett's esophagus neoplasia, and a simplified RFA algorithm. New data on the cost-effectiveness of RFA have also been published, suggesting that RFA is cost-effective for both high-grade and low-grade dysplasia, but not for nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus. A systematic review has shown that lymph node metastases are rare (âˆ¼2%) with intramucosal adenocarcinoma, supporting the use of endoscopic eradication for that lesion. SUMMARY: Research and clinical experience with the endoscopic therapies for Barrett's esophagus continue to grow. Proper patient selection and technique are critical for ensuring a good outcome. Endoscopic surveillance after any of the ablative therapies still appears to be necessary.
