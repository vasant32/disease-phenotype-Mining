A 79-year-old man with peptic stricture of the esophagus was treated by endoscopic aid dilatation using Eder-Peustow dilator. Esophageal perforation was suspected after the second dilatation and conservative treatment was initiated with full recovery. The patient developed Barrett's esophagus despite continuous treatment with ranitidine and metoclopramide. The role of medical treatment in esophageal perforation due to instrumentation was emphasized. Peptic stricture of esophagus is probably not common in our community. The conventional treatment of esophagitis with ranitidine and metoclopramide is not adequate in preventing the occurrence of Barrett's esophagus.
