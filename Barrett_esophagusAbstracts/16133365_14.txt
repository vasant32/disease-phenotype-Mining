Claudins (CLDNs) are key molecules in cell adhesion, polarity, and control of paracellular solute transport. Several studies suggested that changes in claudin pattern have a role in cancer development. This study aimed to detect alterations in CLDN 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 expression patterns in Barrett's esophagus (BE) and adenocarcinoma (ACC) compared with that in foveolar epithelium (FOV), normal squamous epithelium (SQ), and squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC). One hundred twenty five surgically or endoscopically removed, paraffin-embedded cases were studied by immunohistochemistry and analyzed statistically. BE, ACC, and FOV were dissected from 30 paraffin-embedded samples for further mRNA expression analysis. CLDN 7 was the dominating type in all epithelia and carcinomas, but its expression did not differ in normal and altered tissues. CLDN 1 expression was significantly increased in SQCC compared with that in SQ. CLDNs 3 and 4 were significantly elevated both in BE and ACC compared with that in FOV. CLDN 2 expression increased significantly in ACCs compared with that in BE. This is the first report proving similarities and differences regarding claudin expression pattern in BE and ACC compared with that in FOV and SQ. Our data prove a close link in CLDN pattern between BE and ACC, adding further evidence that BE is an alteration preceding esophageal ACC.
