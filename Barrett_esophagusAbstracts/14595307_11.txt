 BACKGROUND: The occurrence of precancerous lesions, such as high-grade dysplasia, in patients with short-segment Barrett's esophagus is controversial. This study assessed the efficacy of autofluorescence endoscopy for detection of high-grade dysplasia in short-segment Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: A total of 34 patients (28 men, 6 women; age range 40-77 years) with histopathologically proven short-segment Barrett's esophagus were studied. Autofluorescence endoscopy was performed by using monochromatized blue light (425-455 nm) filtered from a conventional xenon light source. A total of 136 and 109 biopsy specimens were taken from Barrett's mucosa under control, respectively, white light endoscopy and autofluorescence endoscopy. RESULTS: High-grade dysplasia was found in 9 (8.3%) autofluorescence-guided biopsy specimens, which was significantly greater than the number of white light endoscopy-guided biopsy specimens with this finding (one positive biopsy specimen, 0.7% of total biopsy specimens obtained). Autofluorescence endoscopy detected high-grade dysplasia in 7 patients, 6 more than were identified with white light endoscopy. In the one patient with high-grade dysplasia detected by white light endoscopy-guided biopsy specimens, autofluorescence-guided biopsy specimens revealed only low-grade dysplasia. CONCLUSION: Autofluorescence endoscopy in patients with short-segment Barrett's esophagus increases the detection rate of high-grade dysplasia.
