Barrett's esophagus is a recognized risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Dysplasia in Barrett's epithelium is considered a precursor to malignancy. Several tumor suppressor genes, including p53, have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, the interval between the development of Barrett's esophagus, dysplasia, and frank malignancy is usually very long. A case of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus arising from Barrett's esophagus in a 25-year-old man is discussed. Point mutation in exon 8 of p53 was discovered in this patient's tumor and surrounding dysplastic Barrett's mucosa. To our knowledge, this is the youngest reported case of Barrett's-associated esophageal adenocarcinoma in the medical literature. It suggests that acquired somatic mutations in tumor suppressor genes may occur early in life and that these mutations may contribute to the development of dysplasia and cancer in Barrett's esophagus.
