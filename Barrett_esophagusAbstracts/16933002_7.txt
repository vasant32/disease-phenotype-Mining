 BACKGROUND: The endoscopic grade of the gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV) is suggested to be a good predictor of reflux status. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the GEFV and gastroesophageal and gastropharyngeal reflux. METHODS: A total of 364 patients (151 men and 233 women; mean age, 52.2 years) who underwent endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and ambulatory 24-h dual-probe pH monitoring were included. GEFV was graded I through IV using Hill's classification; then, GEFV was classified into two groups: a normal GEFV group (grades I and II) and an abnormal GEFV group (grades III and IV). Findings of endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and ambulatory pH monitoring were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Increased GEFV grade was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of both reflux esophagitis and Barrett's epithelium (P < 0.001). Lower esophageal sphincter pressure was significantly lower in the abnormal GEFV group than in the normal GEFV group (P < 0.001). All variables showing gastroesophageal reflux in the distal probe were significantly higher in the abnormal GEFV group than in the normal GEFV group (P < 0.001). In addition, all variables, except the supine time of pH < 4, showing gastropharyngeal reflux in the proximal probe were significantly higher in the abnormal GEFV group than in the normal GEFV group (P < 0.001). The frequency of gastroesophageal reflux disease and of gastropharyngeal reflux disease was significantly higher in the abnormal GEFV group than in the normal GEFV group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic grading of the GEFV is easy and provides useful information about the status of gastroesophageal and gastropharyngeal reflux.
