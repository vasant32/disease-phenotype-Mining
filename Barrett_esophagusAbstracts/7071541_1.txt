Two cases of adenocarcinoma in columnar epithelium-lined oesophagus are reported. Two discrete carcinomas were found in one case, and areas of epithelial atypia were demonstrated in regions devoid of tumour in both. Similar observations in the literature together with statistical evidence indicate that Barrett's oesophagus should be regarded as a premalignant condition. Its clinical implications are outlined.
