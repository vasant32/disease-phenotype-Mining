 OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the five-year prospective study the possibility of using the drug UDCA (Ursosan) for the therapeutic management of patients with BE older. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective open randomized, parallel-group 62 patients of BE with a length of metaplasia less than 3 cm in average age 72.8 +/- 2.8 years. Method of "sealed envelopes" were divided into two equal groups. Patients first--received omeprazole at a daily dose of 40 mg, the second--to combine the same dose of omeprazole drug-Ursosan a daily dose of 10 mg/kg. At baseline and after 4.8+1.2 years assessed the frequency of esophageal, extraesophageal and dyspeptic complaints, endoscopic and morphological pattern of esophageal-gastric junction and lower third of the esophagus. Confirm or exclude the diagnosis of BE during follow-up study was performed after a two-fold endoscopy upper GIT using subdivision techniques for sampling biopsy material and subsequent analysis of biopsy samples pathomorphology of various medical institutions. RESULTS: The combination therapy with omeprazole and drug UDCA contributed to the positive dynamics is the lack of intestinal metaplasia in 32.3% of patients with Barrett's esophagus, whereas monotherapy with omeprazole in a daily dose of 40 mg possible to achieve a similar result in 6.5% of patients (p = 0,01). The frequency of diagnosis of erosive esophagitis decreased after 5 years of therapy with 80.6% to 51.6% (p = 0.016) in the omeprazole group and 86.7% to 16.7% (p < 0.001) in the group receiving omeprazole and the preparation of UDCA. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the possibility of combined therapy with omeprazole and the preparation of UDCA (Ursosan) as a promising means for hemopreventciya Barrett's esophagus in the elderly.
