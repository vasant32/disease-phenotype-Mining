 BACKGROUND: Barrett's mucosa resection techniques are time consuming, often difficult to perform, and used with varying success. This report describes the authors' results with a new device and technique for strip endoscopic mucosal resection (SEMR) using a cold excision blade. METHODS: A retrospective review of ex vivo and in vivo animal and human esophagi experiments was conducted to develop the essential design characteristics of a transoral strip mucosal excision device. Depth, size, shape, and technique of excision were serially evaluated. RESULTS: The SEMR device allows precise capsule positioning with satisfactory excision size and depth in ex vivo and in vivo experiments. A total of 10 excisions were performed on five normal ex vivo cadaveric human esophagi. The specimens ranged in size from 3×2.5 to 2.5×2.2 cm. The average specimen thickness was 0.297 mm. For 147 (99.8%) of 150 fields of examination, muscularis mucosa was included. Six additional in vivo experiments demonstrated device safety and feasibility. CONCLUSION: Satisfactory excision depth was reproducible. Further animal survival experiments and clinical trials will define the role of the SEMR device for patients with Barrett's esophagus.
