Five patients with Barrett's esophagus, each with a differing presentation, serve as the basis of this report. Hiatal hernia is noted to be frequently present in Barrett's esophagus, and the incidence of adenocarcinoma is thought to be distinctly increased. The condition is easily diagnosed by fiberoptic endoscopy and verified by direct biopsy. The increasing use of fiberoptic panendoscopy may lead to an increased frequency of diagnosis of the columnar cell-lined lower esophagus and its complications.
