Gastric acid secretion in response to a protein meal and to exogenously administered synthetic human gastrin 17-I was measured in patients with Barrett's esophagus, patients with uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux, and normal age- and sex-matched controls. Acid secretion, both basally and in response to gastrin 17-I, was significantly greater in patients with Barrett's esophagus compared to normal individuals without reflux. Basal gastrin levels and meal-stimulated levels of the hormone were similar among all three groups. Sensitivity to gastrin, expressed as the concentration causing half-maximal acid secretion, was also similar among the study groups. It is speculated that elevated basal acid production in Barrett's esophagus may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disorder.
