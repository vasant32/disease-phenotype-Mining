Reflux esophagitis (RE) and columnar-lined esophagus (CLE) are frequently observed after esophagectomy. The incidence of these conditions according to time and to the route of esophageal reconstruction after esophagectomy remains unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify any changes and differences of the incidence of RE and CLE in patients who underwent gastric tube reconstruction after esophagectomy. A hundred patients who underwent cervical esophagogastrostomy after resection of the thoracic esophagus were included in this study. We reviewed their endoscopic findings at 1 month, at 1 year and at 2 years after surgery, and compared the incidence rates of RE and CLE with the passage of time and among the three reconstruction routes; a subcutaneous route, a retrosternal route, and a posterior mediastinal route. The incidence rate of RE was 42%, 37% and 38%, at 1 month, 1 year and at 2 years after surgery, respectively. There was no significant difference in the incidence of RE according to the time after surgery. The incidence rate of severe RE (Grade C and D in the Los Angeles Classification) was 9% percent at 1 month after surgery, 18% at 1 year after surgery and 22% at 2 years after surgery, significantly increasing with passage of time. The incidence rate of CLE was 0% at 1 month after surgery, 14% at 1 year after surgery and 40% at 2 years after surgery, significantly increasing with passage of time. No difference was observed in the incidence of RE and that of CLE among the three routes of esophageal reconstruction. Severe RE and CLE increase with passage of time after cervical esophagogastrostomy. Therefore, careful endoscopic follow-up is necessary for such patients irrespective of the route of esophageal reconstruction.
