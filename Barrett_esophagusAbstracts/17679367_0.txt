 UNLABELLED: Hiatal hernia seems to be one of the significant clinical problems. The criteria of its diagnosis, occurrence and possible influence on esophageal reflux disease are still controversial. The aim of this paper is to research the incidence of hiatal hernia based on endoscopic criteria of its diagnosis and its influence on other esophageal diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: More than 729 patients, to whom endoscopy was made, were examined. The accepted endoscopic features of hiatal hernia and other lesions which could be related to it and other characteristic features of esophageal reflux disease were searched. RESULTS: On the basis of accepted diagnostic criteria the hiatal hernia was diagnosed in 44.16% of men and in 42.77% of women. There were no difference in hiatal hernia occurrence in relation to age, gender and weight. The endoscopic features of esophageal reflux disease were found in 36.14% of women and 61.47% of men. The statistically significant incidence was observed in patients with hernia 55.99% women and 74.51% men and without hernia respectively in 22.81% and 51.16%. Similar differences took place in specific types of gastroesophageal disease, especially endoscopic features characteristic for Barrett's esophagus were observed nine times more frequently in men with hernia. Types with erosions were observed twice as much in patients with hernia of both sex. Esophagus mucosae cloudiness was observed three times more frequently in women with hernia and 50% more frequently in women. CONCLUSIONS: All the data suggests there is a significant coincidence between hiatal hernia and esophageal reflux disease.
