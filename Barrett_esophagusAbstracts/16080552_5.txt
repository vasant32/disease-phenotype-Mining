A case of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing hepatoid adenocarcinoma in association with Barrett's esophagus with multiple liver metastases, responding to chemotherapy, is reported. A 47-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain after subtotal esophagectomy for an esophageal adenocarcinoma in association with Barrett's esophagus, and was diagnosed as having multiple liver tumors. Most tumor markers were normal, but the serum AFP level was markedly elevated. Dynamic computed tomography and ferumoxide enhanced magnetic resonance imaging did not provide evidence of any primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Since microscopic examination of the resected tumor showed a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma with hepatoid features displaying AFP-immunoreactivity, the liver tumors were thus considered to be metastatic deposits. Surgery was not feasible so chemotherapeutic agents were tried, and the combination of paclitaxel (TXL) and cisplatin (CDDP) gave a partial response and good control for a period. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of effective chemotherapy for liver metastases from an AFP-producing hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
