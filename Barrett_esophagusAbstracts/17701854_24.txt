BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: In patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE), targeted endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of visible lesions of high grade dysplasia (HGD) or intramucosal adenocarcinoma (IMC) is effective, but carries the risk of leaving in place synchronous lesions and Barrett's epithelium with the potential for recurrent disease. We evaluated the safety and long-term efficacy of complete Barrett's eradication EMR (CBE-EMR) for the treatment of patients with HGD or IMC, independently of the presence of macroscopically visible lesions or surgical risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 26 consecutive patients with BE and HGD or IMC underwent CBE-EMRs, which were performed with the endoscopic cap suction method and/or a 2.3-mm monofilament mucosectomy snare. Endoscopic follow up after completion of resection was carried out to assess the rate of residual or recurrent BE with or without HGD or IMC. RESULTS: 24 patients completed the study. They underwent a total of 44 EMR sessions with a median of 3 pieces (range 1-8) removed per session. Two patients with immediate bleeding were successfully managed endoscopically. Three patients developed an early esophageal stricture that was completely resolved with a single endoscopic dilation. After a median follow-up of 28 months (range 15-51 months), persistent endoscopic and histologic eradication of BE was demonstrated in 21 patients (87.5 %). In two patients, Barrett's epithelium was detected beneath the neosquamous epithelium 3 months after completion of the resection. In the remaining patient, IMC was found in a nodule seen and removed by EMR at 12-month surveillance endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: CBE-EMR is a safe and highly effective long-term treatment that should be offered to all patients with Barrett's esophagus with HGD and IMC.
