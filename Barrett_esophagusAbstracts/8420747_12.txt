Helicobacter pylori (HP), known to cause active chronic gastritis, has primarily been found in gastric-type mucosa. Even in the duodenum, the organism was detected in islands of metaplastic gastric mucosa. HP has also been found in gastric metaplasia of Barrett's esophagus in 15-50%. The aim of our study was to determine: (1) the frequency with which HP is found on histopathological sections of heterotopic gastric mucosa (HGM) patch(es) at the upper esophagus, as compared to that of the stomach proper, and (2) the histopathological significance of infection in the HGM patches. From 63 patients with HGM patches at the upper esophagus, 48 patients were found to have concurrent adequate specimen from the stomach for modified Steiner's stain. In 22 patients (45.8%), pair sections from HGM and stomach were negative for HP. Of 26 patients (54.1%) HP-positive on sections from the antrum and/or body (both in 21 cases) nine patients (18.7%) demonstrated HP in the HGM patches. Whereas focal acute inflammatory changes on the H&E section of HGM was present in six patients, HP was detected in HGM only in one. Chronic inflammatory cell infiltration was detected in all nine HP-positive HGM patches and in 37 of 39 HP-negative patches. A mixed acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration was found in five of these 37 patients. Our data demonstrate that HP infection of HGM patches at the upper esophagus is part of the HP gastritis and an independent colonization of HGM patches without gastric infection does not occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
