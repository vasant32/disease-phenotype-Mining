Advanced endoscopic imaging techniques have made the early diagnosis of neoplastic lesions in Barrett's esophagus easier. A new chapter in minimal invasive cancer therapy has been opened. Endoscopic treatment of early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus (high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and mucosal adenocarcinoma) has become the method of choice in most countries. Long-term results for endoscopic treatment in a large group of patients are now available. These emerging data suggest that endoscopic therapy is safe and highly effective with long-term complete remission rates of more than 94%. All visible lesions should be treated by endoscopic resection for histologic confirmation of the neoplastic lesion rather than by ablative techniques. After successful endoscopic resection of all visible and localizable high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and mucosal cancer, ablative treatment of the remaining Barrett's epithelium at risk should be performed to reduce the rate of recurrent or metachronous neoplasia.
