Esophageal adenocarcinoma has demonstrated a rapid increase in incidence over the last 10 years. This increase mirrors a dramatic rise in that of Barrett esophagus, which is associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma in at least 95% of cases. In an attempt to understand the pathogenesis of esophageal adenocarcinoma, attention has turned to the antiapoptotic and oncogenic pathways. Here we demonstrated that Akt was frequently activated in Barrett esophagus-related adenocarcinoma. Remarkably, the levels of Akt activation were associated with tumor progression. After institutional review board ethics approval, 60 archival tissue specimens of esophageal adenocarcinoma arising on a background of Barrett esophagus were selected for immunohistochemical staining with phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) antibody. The slides were scored by 2 independent observers. Approximately 80% of high-grade dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma cases demonstrated strong to moderate Akt activity. Sixty-two percent of Barrett mucosa revealed low Akt activity, the remaining cases being p-Akt negative. None of the low-grade dysplasia cases exhibited strong p-Akt staining, whereas only weak p-Akt activity is seen in a portion of metaplastic Barrett mucosa, Akt is highly activated in high-grade dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma arising from Barrett esophagus. These findings suggest a role of p-Akt in the progression of Barrett esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma and provide the rationale for using p-Akt inhibitor API-2/triciribine, which is currently in clinical trial, in the treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
