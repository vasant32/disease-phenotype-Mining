 BACKGROUND: Because of a rapid increase in the incidence of Barrett's cancer, the appropriate surveillance method for Barrett's esophagus is of interest. Methylene blue chromoendoscopy has been reported to be an effective and inexpensive method to improve biopsy surveillance of Barrett's epithelium. However, the usefulness of this method in short-segment Barrett's esophagus cases is still controversial. AIMS: This study was undertaken to evaluate the abilities of crystal violet and methylene blue chromoendoscopy to detect potentially dysplastic Barrett's epithelium in cases with short-segment columnar-appearing epithelium of the esophago-gastric junction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred patients with endoscopically suspected short-segment Barrett's esophagus were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive chromoendoscopy with 0.05% crystal violet, 0.1% crystal violet, 0.5% methylene blue, or 1.0% methylene blue. During crystal violet and methylene blue chromoendoscopy, biopsy specimens were obtained from stained and unstained columnar-appearing epithelium of the esophago-gastric junction, and the detection rates of Barrett's epithelium were evaluated. The value of pit pattern diagnosis was also evaluated as a possible way to detect dysplastic Barrett's epithelium. RESULTS: Chromoendoscopy with 0.05% crystal violet detected histologically confirmed Barrett's epithelium with the highest sensitivity (89.2%) and specificity (85.7%). Crystal violet clearly stained both dysplastic and nondysplastic Barrett's epithelia and made the surface pit pattern easy to observe without using magnifying endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of crystal violet chromoendoscopy and pit pattern diagnosis is considered to be useful for the surveillance of short-segment Barrett's esophagus.
