The role of reflux in the development of esophagitis, stricture, and Barrett's esophagus is well recognized. However, reflux is not an infrequent cause of atypical chest pain, chronic pulmonary disorders, and pharyngeal and laryngeal changes. Increased insight into the pathogenesis of reflux and the relationship between the gastroesophageal junction and the diaphragmatic crura has led to more effective treatment approaches. Medical therapy, including lifestyle changes, antacids, and systemic agents, is effective in most patients. However, surgery may be necessary in patients with anatomic abnormalities or mechanical dysfunction.
