 BACKGROUND: Although the efficacy and safety of extensive endomucosal resection (EMR) in eradicating Barrett's esophagus (BE) harbouring early neoplasia have been established, factors predicting efficacy remains unclear. AIM: To determine the complete eradication rate of Barrett's esophagus with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or intramucosal carcinoma (IMC), safety, and factors predicting complete eradication by EMR. METHODS: Patients with histological confirmation of Barrett's HGIN/IMC were prospectively identified. EMR was performed using Duette multiband ligator or cap technique by a single operator (NEM). RESULTS: 99 patients (81 males) with median age 67 years [interquartile range (IQR) 60-77 years] and median Barrett's length 4 cm (IQR 2-6 cm) were included. Of 628 index EMRs [mean 6.3, median 5 (IQR 3-8)], 23% showed IMC, 58.5% showed HGIN, and 16% showed low-grade dysplasia only. A median of 8 EMR resections per patient (IQR 6-16, 1,064 resections in 89 patients) resulted in complete eradication of BE harboring neoplasia in 49.4% and eradication of HGIN/IMC in 81% (BE <5 cm subgroup: 65% complete eradication and 91% HGIN eradication) at median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-27 months). On univariate analysis, focal dysplasia (P = 0.003) and Barrett's length <5 cm (P = 0.001) were predictors of complete BE eradication. Barrett's length <5 cm was the only significant predictor [odds ratio (OR) 3.4, standard error (SE) 0.11, P = 0.0006] on multiple logistic regression analysis. Strictures developed in 27% and major bleeding in 2% with no procedure-related perforations or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive EMR for removal of BE with early neoplasia is safe. Outcomes for complete BE eradication are modest at 49.4% and eradication of high-grade dysplasia at 81%. Barrett's length <5 cm is the only significant predictor of complete response.
