The postoperative assessment of free flaps is essential to identify and act on signs of incipient flap failure. Where the flap is completely buried, this becomes almost impossible unless part of the flap is exteriorised or an overlying skin window is used. Alternatively, complicated and often impractical monitoring devices have been advocated, but these have failed to gain widespread acceptance. A simpler solution to this problem has been evaluated in a series of patients using colour duplex Doppler imaging. This re-appraisal of a previously reported technique has been facilitated by updated technology in diagnostic radiology. Duplex Doppler imaging was confirmed as an accurate, non-invasive, and inexpensive tool for the postoperative measurement of blood flow within the pedicles of five buried free flaps in four patients undergoing surgery in our unit.
