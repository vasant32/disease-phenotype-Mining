OBJECTIVES: Lifestyle and demographic risk factors for the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma developing from columnar-lined oesophagus are not well defined. METHODS: Demographic and lifestyle factors, endoscopy and histology reports were extracted from 1,761 subjects from seven UK centres. The associations of columnar-lined oesophagus with demographic and lifestyle factors and the development of adenocarcinoma were examined. RESULTS: 5.5% of patients had prevalent adenocarcinoma (more common in males, older patients, patients diagnosed earlier in the cohort and current or recent smokers). Adenocarcinoma incidence was 23 patients in 3,912 years or 0.59% per annum. Only increased age at diagnosis correlated with an increased risk of incident adenocarcinoma. There was no association with obesity or alcohol history. CONCLUSIONS: Oesophageal adenocarcinoma occurs more commonly in older patients and is more frequent in males than females. Once columnar-lined oesophagus had been diagnosed, there were no other demographic or lifestyle factors which were predictive of the development of incident adenocarcinoma in this cohort.
