Lgr5 (leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5), a recently discovered intestinal stem cell marker, is expressed in premalignant lesions including Barrett's esophagus (BE) and cancers including colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It was also recently found to be expressed in tumor spheres prepared from colon cancer, suggesting that it will likely serve as a cancer stem cell marker. We sought to examine Lgr5 as a biomarker in BE-associated neoplasia. Using standard immunohistochemistry, we performed immunostaining on 81 esophageal specimens (53 biopsy specimens and 28 surgical resections) representing BE, BE-associated dysplasia, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Each immunostain was scored based on intensity of immunostaining and percentage of positive cells. For 24 EAC cases, survival analysis was performed with expression scores and other clinicopathological variables. We found that Lgr5 expression was detected in 70% of BE cases and between 90 and 100% of advanced dysplastic lesions and EAC. The intensity of expression was significantly higher in high-grade dysplasia and EAC than BE. In EAC, high Lgr5 expression scores (> or = 5) were associated with worse survival, independent of stage, age, and neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy (P = 0.03). Our findings suggest that Lgr5 has potential utility as a biomarker for BE-associated dysplasia and EAC.
