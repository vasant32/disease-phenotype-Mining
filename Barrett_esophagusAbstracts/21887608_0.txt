 BACKGROUND: Pre-operative upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy prior to gastric banding surgery remains controversial. We report the finding of asymptomatic oesophageal adenocarcinomas detected at pre-operative endoscopy in our unit. METHODS: Data from a prospectively maintained database concerning the period May 2003 to October 2010 were reviewed. We identified 371 patients who had undergone upper GI endoscopy prior to gastric banding. Endoscopy reports were reviewed to identify any pathology detected. RESULTS: Endoscopy revealed abnormalities in 207 (56%) patients. A range of abnormalities were detected, the most significant of which were two asymptomatic oesophageal adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of two early, asymptomatic oesophageal adenocarcinomas in a high risk patient group justifies our policy of routine upper GI endoscopy prior to gastric banding surgery.
