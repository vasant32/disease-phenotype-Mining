Bronchopulmonary fistula, a communication between the bronchial airway and the pleural space, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality often requiring surgical therapy. A successful closure of a fistula from the posterior trachea to the right apical pleural space in a 60-year-old man with a history of Barrett's esophagus, esophagectomy, multiple pulmonary infections, and right upper lobectomy using an Amplatzer Multi-Fenestrated Septal Occluder via a transbronchial approach is reported.
