We examined 39 samples of metaplastic specialized epithelium (SE), 27 of low-grade dysplasia (LGD), 27 of high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and 46 of adenocarcinoma (CA) derived from Barrett esophagus for c-erb-b2 gene amplification using differential polymerase chain reaction and for overexpression of c-erb-b2 protein using immunohistochemical analysis. Amplification of the c-erb-b2 gene was as follows: SE, 0.0%; LGD, 0.0%; HGD, 11.1%; and CA, 13.6%; and protein overexpression was as follows: SE, 0.0%; LGD, 7.4%; HGD, 18.5%; and CA, 21.7%. In 8 (89%) of 9 samples, c-erb-b2 gene amplification correlated with protein overexpression. The reverse was true in 8 (47%) of 17 samples: c-erb-b2 protein overexpression was proved with simultaneous gene amplification. Amplification of c-erb-b2 is a late event in the carcinogenesis of Barrett esophagus. In contrast, protein overexpression appears more often and earlier Besides gene amplification, other mechanisms to induce protein overexpression must exist.
