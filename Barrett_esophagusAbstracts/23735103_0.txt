Barrett's esophagus has been a focus of confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) research. There are two CLE systems available, one probe-based and the other with a microscope embedded in the tip of an endoscope. Several CLE image classification systems are available. Studies suggest that CLE has good sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy for detecting neoplasia, with good interobserver agreement using the CLE image classification systems. Larger, multicenter studies have been completed evaluating the impact of CLE on treatment of patients with BE. Future developments may include more specific contrast agents and new types of endomicroscopes.
