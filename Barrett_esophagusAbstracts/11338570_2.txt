Systemic sclerosis is a generalized systemic autoimmune disorder frequently involving the oesophagus causing reflux oesophagitis in the majority of patients. Barrett's oesophagus is one of the most serious complication of the reflux oesophagitis, in which the normal oesophageal squamous epithelium is partially replaced by metaplastic columnar epithelium. The clinical significance of Barrett's oesophagus is the significantly increased risk of developing the adenocarcinoma. In our paper, the authors present 5 cases with Barrett's oesophagus among their 52 examined patients with scleroderma.
