 OBJECTIVE: Barrett's oesophagus is associated with abdominal obesity. Adiponectin is a peptide that is secreted from adipocytes and circulates in three multimeric forms: low molecular weight (LMW), middle molecular weight (MMW), and high molecular weight (HMW). The anti-inflammatory effects of adiponectin are specific to individual multimers, with LMW being most anti-inflammatory. We postulated that circulating levels of adiponectin and its multimers would be associated with the risk of Barrett's oesophagus. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Outpatient clinic in North Carolina, USA. PATIENTS: Cases of Barrett's oesophagus and controls undergoing upper endoscopy for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adjusted odds ratios of plasma adiponectin levels and its multimers for Barrett's oesophagus. RESULTS: There were 112 cases of Barrett's oesophagus and 199 GORD controls. Total adiponectin was not associated with Barrett's oesophagus (3(rd) tertile vs 1(st) tertile adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.44 to 1.78). High levels of LMW adiponectin were associated with a decreased risk of Barrett's oesophagus (3(rd) tertile vs 1(st) tertile aOR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.69), and a high LMW/total ratio appeared particularly inversely associated with Barrett's oesophagus (3(rd) tertile vs 1(st) tertile aOR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of LMW adiponectin are associated with a decreased risk of Barrett's oesophagus among patients with GORD. Further human studies are required to confirm these findings, and in vitro studies are needed to understand if there is a mechanism whereby adiponectin may affect Barrett's metaplasia.
