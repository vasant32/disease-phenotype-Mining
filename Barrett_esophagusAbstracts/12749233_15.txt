 BACKGROUND/AIMS: A common genetic abnormality detected in Barrett's adenocarcinoma is LOH (loss of heterozygosity) at the sites of known or putative tumor suppressor genes. Thus, some deletions have also been determined in peritumoral Barrett's epithelium. These findings suggest that a tissue field of somatic genetic alterations precede the histopathological phenotypic changes of carcinoma. We investigated 32 cases of Barrett's esophagus with no evidence of dysplasia for LOH at 5q21 (APC), 3p21, 9p21 (p16) and 17p13.1 (p53) chromosomal regions. METHODOLOGY: Two groups were randomly selected and compared: 16 cases of Barrett's epithelium adjacent to adenocarcinoma and 16 cases of Barrett's epithelium with no evidence of malignant transformation in a 5-10 years follow-up period. In three adenocarcinomas cases several previous endoscopic biopsies of Barrett's esophagus were available. RESULTS: We determined frequent allelic losses in adenocarcinomas at p53 (54%), p16 (50%), 3p21 (40%) and 5q21 (33%). Identical LOH was present in most cases in the Barrett's epithelium adjacent to adenocarcinoma. LOH at these loci was unusual in Barrett's epithelium with no evidence of malignant transformation. However, in cases where sequential endoscopic biopsies were performed in advance to the adenocarcinoma diagnosis LOH was already present in the Barrett's epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that LOH at these loci may be present before the onset of the malignant growth and LOH studies may supplement the histopathological evaluation of Barrett's epithelium. LOH at 3p21, 5q21, 9p21 and 17p13 chromosomal regions in cells of Barrett's epithelium without dysplasia may have a role as a potential marker for individuals with a high risk of developing adenocarcinoma.
