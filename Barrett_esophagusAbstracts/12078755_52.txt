 BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy for high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus has been advocated. Although long-term survival data exist, little is known about functional outcome and quality of life in this particular subset of patients. METHODS: The records of all patients who underwent esophageal resection for high-grade dysplasia from June 1991 through July 1997 were reviewed. Long-term functional outcome and quality of life were assessed using a two-part written survey. RESULTS: There were 54 patients (48 men, 6 women). Median age was 64 years (range, 36 to 83 years). Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy was performed in 34 patients (63%), transhiatal esophagectomy in 10 (18%), extended esophagectomy in 8 (15%), and other in 2 (4%). Invasive carcinoma was found in 19 patients (35%). Five patients (9%) were stage 0, 7 (13%) stage I, 3 (6%) stage IIA, 1 (2%) stage IIB, and 3 patients (6%) stage III. There was one operative death (1.8%). Complications occurred in 31 patients (57%). Median hospitalization was 13 days (range, 11 to 44 days). Follow-up was complete in all patients and ranged from 6 months to 9 years (median, 63 months). Overall 5-year survival was 86% and did not differ significantly from a population matched for age and gender. Five-year survival for patients with only high-grade dysplasia was 96% and 68% for patients with cancer (p = 0.017). Quality of life was measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. For patients with only high-grade dysplasia, the role-physical and role-emotional scores were better than for the control population (p < 0.03). For patients with cancer, the health perception score was worse than for the control population (p < 0.03). Scores measuring physical-function, social function, mental health, bodily pain, and energy/fatigue were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Although perioperative morbidity is significant, surgical resection of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus provides excellent long-term survival with acceptable function and quality of life.
