Three patients who were 8 to 30 years status postmyotomy for achalasia were shown to develop Barrett's columnar metaplasia of the esophagus. In one instance, the patient had multiple areas of severe dysplasia to carcinoma in situ. There have been only a few reports in the world literature of Barrett's metaplasia occurring in postmyotomy achalasia patients. Our experience would indicate it may be a more common complication than previously appreciated. Also, a possible causal relationship between surgical intervention, Barrett's epithelium, and adenocarcinoma in achalasia is suggested.
