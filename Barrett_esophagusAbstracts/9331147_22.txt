When compared to patients with erosive esophagitis, patients with Barrett's esophagus have demonstrated reduced chemo- and mechanoreceptor sensitivity to acid infusion and balloon distension, respectively. However, anecdotal clinical experience suggested an increase in symptom perception in patients after successful elimination of Barrett's epithelium, using multipolar electrocoagulation (MPEC) and high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI). To determine perception thresholds to acid infusion, we evaluated eight consecutive patients after a series of MPEC treatments resulted in complete elimination of Barrett's mucosa and compared them to 10 age-matched patients with nonreversed Barrett's esophagus and 10 patients with symptomatic, endoscopy-documented erosive esophagitis (Hetzel-Dent grade 2 or greater). Chemosensitivity was determined by a modified acid perfusion test, where acid perception thresholds were quantified by the lag time to initial typical symptom perception, sensory intensity rating, and an acid perfusion sensory score (APSS). While patients after successful elimination of Barrett's esophagus had similar sensory intensity ratings and APSS as patients with erosive esophagitis, the lag times differed significantly between the groups, and both groups had significantly higher sensory intensity ratings and APSS than patients with nonreversed Barrett's esophagus. In conclusion, patients after complete reversal of Barrett's mucosa are unexpectedly as sensitive to acid as symptomatic patients with erosive esophagitis.
