In animal models, mixed acid and bile reflux into lower esophagus induces histological changes comparable to Barrett's metaplasia (BM) and neoplasia. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Roux-en-Y (REY) surgery and medical therapy on BM in animals before the development of neoplasia. Vagus preserving esophagojejunostomy operation was performed on Sprague-Dawley rats to achieve gastroduodenal reflux (GDR) into the esophagus in 30 animals. After 3 months, changes were reversed in 10 animals (Group REY) by REY operation, 10 animals (Group proton pump inhibitor [PPI]) were given PPI during the postoperative period, and 10 animals (Group GDR) did not have further intervention. At 4 months, histological examination of the lower esophagus was performed by an experienced pathologist. Physiological parameters were also analyzed in all animals preoperatively and at 4 months postoperatively. The length of columnar mucosa, degree of acute inflammation, degree of metaplasia, and composite BM score were significantly reduced by REY surgery compared with medical therapy and with control (columnar mucosa in cm [mean +/- standard error of the mean] Group REY 0.44 +/- 0.06, Group PPI 0.92 +/- 0.08, P < 0.001/Group GDR 1.17 +/- 0.31, P < 0.03). There was no neoplasia seen in any specimen. At 4 months, postoperatively controls Group REY surgery showed significantly more normalization of physiological parameters to preoperative levels than Group PPI (P < 0.05). REY surgery is potentially more beneficial than medical therapy in reversing the histological and biochemical changes of Barrett's esophagus due to GDR.
