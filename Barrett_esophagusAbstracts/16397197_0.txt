Gastroesophageal reflux is a relatively common condition in dogs and cats and may lead to secondary reflux esophagitis. A consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux that is well described in humans is Barrett's esophagus, which is the replacement of the normal squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus with metaplastic columnar epithelium. Three cats with clinical and endoscopic signs of chronic esophagitis had metaplastic columnar epithelium on biopsy of the distal esophageal mucosa. Suspected underlying causes were cardial incompetence and sliding hiatal hernia. Two cats had complete resolution of the clinical signs after treatment. One cat was euthanized.
