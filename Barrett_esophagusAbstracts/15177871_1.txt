At the gastric cardia, the molecular mechanisms of inflammation and metaplasia are incompletely understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the expression of TFF1, TFF2 and TFF3 at this site and correlate these data with Helicobacter pylori infection or gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). In 27 patients without intestinal metaplasia at the cardia, endoscopic biopsies were obtained for histology and RT-PCR. TFF1 and TFF2 were expressed in all cardia samples. TFF3 expression was significantly more frequent at the cardia (n = 15/24) than in the corpus (n = 2/26). TFF3 expression at the cardia was mainly observed in GERD patients, and there was a clear tendency towards higher interleukin-8 (IL-8) transcription levels; whereas TFF3 expression was not correlated with the H. pylori status or to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression. The expression of TFF3 at the cardia may represent an adaptation to GERD and precede the development of Barrett's esophagus.
