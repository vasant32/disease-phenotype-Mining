Two patients had both scleroderma and a columnar epithelium-lined lower esophagus (Barrett esophagus). Features of Barrett's esophagus included high esophageal strictures in both patients and ulcer craters in the columnar area of one. Biopsy confirmed columnar epithelium in the lower esophagus of each patient. In these patients, the Barrett esophagus probably was a complication of scleroderma and resulted from long-standing gastroesophageal reflux.
