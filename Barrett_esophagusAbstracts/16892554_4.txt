The potential of gene expression profiles to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus was analyzed. Paraffin-embedded endoscopic esophageal tumor biopsies of 38 patients with advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma (Barrett's adenocarcinoma) were included. All patients underwent two cycles of cisplatin and fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy with or without additional paclitaxel (taxol) followed by abdominothoracal esophagectomy. RNA expression levels of 5-FU-metabolism associated genes thymidylate synthase (TS), thymidine phosphorylase (TP), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), MAP7, ELF3, as well as of platinum and taxane associated related genes caldesmon, excision cross-complementing genes (ERCC1 and ERCC4) HER2-neu, DNA damage-inducible gene 45 (GADD45) and multidrug resistance genes (MDR1, MRP1) were determined using real-time RT-PCR. Expression levels were correlated with the histopathological response to chemotherapy assessed in surgically resected specimens. Responding patients showed significantly higher pretherapeutic expression levels of MTHFR (p = 0.012), Caldesmon (p = 0.016), MRP1 (p = 0.007) and MDR1 (p = 0.025). In addition, patients with high pretherapeutic MTHFR and MRP1 levels had a survival benefit after surgery (p = 0.013 and p = 0.015, respectively). Additionally, intratumoral heterogeneity of gene expression of selected genes (TP, DPD, MTHFR, HER2-neu, Caldesmon, ERCC4, MRP1) was additionally verified in 9 untreated Barrett's adenocarcinoma by examination of 5 distinct tumor areas and was observed in 12.7% (5.6%-23.5%, CI 95%) of all cases analyzed. Our results indicate that determination of mRNA levels of a few genes may be useful for the prediction of the success of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in individual cancer patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
