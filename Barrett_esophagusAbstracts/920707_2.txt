Tissue gastrin was determined in 36 biopsies obtained from the esophagus and 35 biopsies from the stomach in 12 patients with Barrett's esophagus. Histology of the mucosa from the area adjacent to the biopsy sites was also examined. Esophageal biopsies were obtained from three different sites in each patient. The gastric biopsies were obtained from the antrum, fundus, and the area just distal to the lower border of the lower esophageal sphincter. The columnar mucosa lining the esophagus was of three distinct types, namely, fundic, transitional (cardiac), or specialized. None of these epithelia nor the squamous epithelium showed any detectable gastrin. In contrast, antral mucosa had very high gastrin content; smaller amounts of gastrin were detected in duodenal epithelium, whereas fundic mucosa sometimes contained small amounts of gastrin.
