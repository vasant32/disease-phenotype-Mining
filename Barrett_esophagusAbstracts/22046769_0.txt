The pathological gastroesophageal reflux disease may lead to the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), manifested as a spectrum of conditions including erosive esophagitis, Barrett esophagus and has been linked to the development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The gastroesophageal reflux has been incriminated in the occurence of a number of pulmonary symptoms and diseases, otolaryngologic symptoms, and other extraesophageal manifestations. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility of some extraesophageal reflux-related manifestations, even in the absence of heartburn and acid reflux, classic esophageal symptoms of GERD. Although the correlation between gastroesophageal reflux disease and the extraesophageal manifestations has been established, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been proved yet. In this article, we present the respiratory manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease, referring to epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment.
