 BACKGROUND: Dysplasia in Barrett esophagus is a premalignant condition that is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma. Unfortunately, clinical investigation aimed at prevention of progression to malignant disease has been hampered by the variable prevalence of dysplasia reported in the literature. The objective of the current study was to more accurately determine the prevalence of dysplasia among individuals with Barrett esophagus who would be available for enrollment in a chemoprevention trial. METHODS: The pathology archives of 3 institutions were reviewed over a 5-year period for all reports of diagnoses of Barrett esophagus. Surgical cases, malignancies, and duplicate or referral cases were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 790 cases of Barrett esophagus were identified. Of these, 37 (4.7%) were cases of low-grade dysplasia (LGD), and 20 (2.5%) were cases of high-grade dysplasia. The University of Michigan Medical Center (Ann Arbor, MI) diagnosed 18 cases of LGD, Henry Ford Hospital (Detroit, MI) diagnosed 15 cases of LGD, and Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA) diagnosed 4 cases of LGD in patients with Barrett esophagus over the 5-year study period. CONCLUSIONS: The confirmed low prevalence of cases of LGD will affect the design of future clinical trials of chemopreventive interventions for Barrett esophagus.
