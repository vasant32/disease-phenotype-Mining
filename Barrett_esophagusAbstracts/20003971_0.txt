 BACKGROUND: Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is frequently associated with Barrett's esophagus (BE). The response of esophageal adenocarcinoma to chemoradiation therapy is well described; however, the effect of chemoradiation on tumor-associated BE has not been specifically reported. OBJECTIVE: To determine the response of tumor-associated BE to chemoradiation therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A single National Cancer Institute Comprehensive Cancer Care Center experience. PATIENTS: The study cohort consisted of 43 patients with stage I to IVA esophageal adenocarcinoma associated with BE who received either neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiation therapy and underwent either esophagectomy or surveillance at our institution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: The presence and extent of BE after chemoradiation therapy of esophageal adenocarcinoma associated with endoscopically documented pretreatment BE. RESULTS: BE persisted after chemoradiation therapy in 93% (40/43) of cases (95% CI, 83%-99%). Twenty-seven patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy before esophagectomy. Persistent BE was detected in all 27 surgical specimens (100%). In 59% (16/27) of the cases, there was complete pathologic tumor response. Sixteen patients received definitive chemoradiation therapy. Persistent pretreatment BE was identified in 88% (14/16) by surveillance endoscopy (95% CI, 60%-98%). The mean length of BE before and after chemoradiation was 6.6 cm and 5.8 cm, respectively (P = .38). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design, small sample size, and single-site data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Chemoradiation therapy of esophageal adenocarcinoma does not eliminate tumor-associated BE, nor does it affect the length of the BE segment.
