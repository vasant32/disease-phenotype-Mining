Previously, we identified P-glycoprotein in primary gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas and in adjacent mucosa. This study is a further investigation of P-glycoprotein expression in adenocarcinomas and benign mucosa. Sixteen resection specimens were studied (seven for gastric adenocarcinoma, seven for esophageal adenocarcinoma, one for adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction, and one for severe dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus). Multiple samples of tumor and mucosa were submitted according to a specimen diagram. Lymph node and distant metastases were studied when available. P-glycoprotein expression was identified in paraffin-embedded tissues by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibody C219 and was scored as the percentage of cells stained. P-glycoprotein was identified in six of 16 resection specimens. Intratumoral variability of C219 score was noted in three resections. No increase in expression was identified in lymph node or distant metastases as compared with primary tumors or in the invasive margin of the tumor as compared to the center. For every case in which tumors expressed P-glycoprotein, it was also diffusely present in all types of benign gastric and Barrett's mucosa, both adjacent to and distant from (up to 8 cm) the tumor. We also studied biopsies from 10 patients with Barrett's esophagus who did not have carcinoma. P-glycoprotein was only focally present in one of the 10 biopsies. Mucosa expressing P-glycoproteins may be the substrate from which a P-glycoprotein positive tumor arises.
