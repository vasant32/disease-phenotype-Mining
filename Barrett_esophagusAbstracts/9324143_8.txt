BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy with extensive lymph node dissection is the best way to give Barrett's patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma a good chance of cure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients underwent subtotal (n = 47) or distal (n = 8) esophagectomy for Barrett's adenocarcinoma (n = 43) or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) (n = 12). Thirteen patients (23.6%) never had had any reflux symptom before disclosure of the neoplastic lesion, and 20 patients (36.4%) had esophageal shortening. Ro resections (n = 50) included removal of the esophageal tube en bloc with the locoregional lymph nodes. RESULTS: An invasive carcinoma was found in the resected specimen of 4 of the 12 patients operated on for HGD. Two of the 5 patients whose metaplasia was surveyed endoscopically were operated on for an advanced lesion (T2N1, T3N1) because they had not strictly complied with the proposed schedule. One of the 4 patients whose HGD was followed up endoscopically until disclosure of deeper mucosal invasion had positive lymph nodes at operation. The prevalence of early lesions (Tis, T1, T2, No) was 7.4% in patients with tumor-related symptoms versus 85.7% in those having unrelated symptoms (P = 0.0000), which resulted in a 5-year survival rate of 33.8% and 82.4%, respectively (P = 0.0012). Five-year survival rate after Ro resection made for invasive carcinoma was 59.3% (all cases), 73.1% (No), 61.5% (< or =5 positive lymph nodes), and 0% (>5 positive lymph nodes). CONCLUSIONS: High-grade dysplasia is an indication for esophageal resection. Early detection of the neoplastic transformation of Barrett's metaplasia prior to the onset of obstructive symptoms gives the best chance of cure. Esophagectomy with radical lymph node clearance is capable of curing a large proportion of the patients having no or a limited number of metastatic lymph nodes.
