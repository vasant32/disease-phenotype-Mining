We report a rare complication after laparoscopic fundoplication using a dual-sided PTFE/ePTFE (Bard® Crurasoft™) mesh fixation. A 53-year-old man was re-operated for a recurrent hiatal hernia. The hiatal hernia was reinforced using a mesh. Two years later, the patient presented with serious dysphagia and weight loss. An endoscopy revealed a migrated mesh in the stomach. The mesh was excreted within the stool without notice. The PTFE/ePTFE mesh, which is designed for treating hiatal defects, is considered to have superior tissue incorporation, together with less adhesion formation and fistulation. As mesh migration into the upper gastrointestinal tract is possible, it should be used with great care in the peri-oesophageal region.
