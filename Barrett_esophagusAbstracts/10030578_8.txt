PURPOSE: To report a case of esophageal adenocarcinoma and areas of gastric differentiation in the esophagus (Barrett esophagus) metastatic to the orbit. METHODS: A 47-year-old man with a history of esophageal carcinoma developed turgescence around his left eye. He underwent a biopsy and histologic examination of a left orbital mass. RESULTS: Histopathology of the orbital tumor was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma from the esophagus. CONCLUSIONS: This metastatic adenocarcinoma to the orbit likely arose in Barrett esophagus.
