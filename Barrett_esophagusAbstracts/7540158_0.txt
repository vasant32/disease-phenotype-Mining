OBJECTIVES: In the curative treatment of the adenocarcinoma of the cardia (AC), the extent of the esogastrectomy and the need for lymph node dissection are still debated. The palliative treatment of AC is now currently non-surgical. The aim of this study was: a) to assess early results of palliative surgery; b) to evaluate the results of curative resection with reference to the influence of the extent of gastrectomy and lymph node dissection on early results and long-term survival. METHODS: From 1979 to 1989, 179 patients (mean age = 60 +/- 12 years) with AC had 45 palliative resections (mean age = 56 +/- 15) and 134 curative resections (mean age = 61 +/- 12). Thirty-eight proximal subtotal esogastrectomies (PSOG) and 7 total esogastrectomies (TOG) were palliative; 72 PSOG and 62 TOG extended to the spleen were curative and associated with lymphadenectomy. RESULTS: The operative mortality rate was 8.9% regardless of the palliative or curative intent of resection. After palliative resection, the mortality rate was 2.6% (1 case out of 38) after PSOG and 42.9% (3 cases out of 7) after OGT (P = 0.01); the median survival was 8 months. After curative resection, the mortality rate was 12.5% (9 cases out of 72) after PSOG and 4.8% (3 cases out of 62) after extended TOG (P = 0.2); actuarial 5-year survival rate was 42% after PSOG and 39% after extended TOG. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that: a) palliative PSOG for AC can be performed with a low mortality; b) resection with extensive lymphadenectomy allows substantial survival regardless of the extent of gastrectomy.
