Barrett's oesophagus is a premalignant condition. The possibility of eradicating at least partially the metaplastic epithelium has been reported recently. In this case report, a patient with Barrett's oesophagus complicated by high grade dysplasia and focal adenocarcinoma was treated by Nd:Yag laser then high dose rate intraluminal irradiation while on omeprazole 40 mg/day. A partial eradication of Barrett's oesophagus and a transient tumoural regression were obtained. Histologically, residual specialized-type glandular tissue was observed beneath regenerative squamous epithelium. Four months after intraluminal irradiation, a local tumoural recurrence was detected while the area of restored squamous epithelium was unchanged on omeprazole 40 mg/day. This indicates that physical destruction of Barrett's oesophagus associated with potent antisecretory treatment can induce a regression of the metaplastic epithelium, even in presence of high grade dysplasia. The persistence of specialized-type glands beneath the squamous epithelium raises important issues about its potential malignant degeneration.
