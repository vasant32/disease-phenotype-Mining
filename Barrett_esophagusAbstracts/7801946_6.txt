OBJECTIVES: It has been suggested that the presence of Barrett's mucosa is a marker for potential malignancy in other organs. Our objective was to study subjects with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus arising in Barrett's epithelium. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and with no esophageal pathology and recorded the occurrence of extraesophageal malignancies and the heavy use of tobacco and alcohol. RESULTS: The prevalence of extraesophageal malignancies was not higher in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (15%) than in patients in either control group (14% each). Patients with either type of cancer of the esophagus had higher rates of tobacco and alcohol use than normal controls (tobacco: p = 0.02 and p < 0.01 for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, vs. normal controls; alcohol: p < 0.01 for each esophageal malignancy vs. normal controls). The rate of tobacco and alcohol use was higher in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma than in those with adenocarcinoma, but only the difference in alcohol consumption was statistically significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus are not at higher risk for development of extraesophageal malignancy. This observation applies to both those with and without underlying Barrett's epithelium. Alcohol and tobacco use appear to be related to the malignant transformation of esophageal epithelium.
