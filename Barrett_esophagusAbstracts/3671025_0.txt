The authors report a case of Barrett's oesophagus in a child. This observation is characterized by the extent of the lesion which is of three types of metaplasic epithelium usually seen in this disease (fundic, cardial and intestinal tissue); the difficulties in differential diagnosis from uncomplicated hiatal hernia justify radiological and endoscopical examinations with multiple biopsies. The discussion centers on the risk of malignant transformation with its therapeutical consequences and the long term follow-up of such patients.
