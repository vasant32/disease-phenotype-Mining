INTRODUCTION: It is widely accepted that long segments of Barrett's esophagus are caused by end-stage gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but little is known about the correlation of severity of GERD and extent of metaplasia. METHODS: Twenty normal volunteers and 142 patients with different extent of intestinal metaplasia (39 with intestinal metaplasia limited to the esophagogastric junction, 48 with short segments of Barrett's esophagus, and 55 with long segments) underwent manometry and combined pH-bilirubin monitoring. RESULTS: The extent of intestinal metaplasia correlated to the exposition of gastric and duodenal juice in the esophagus and inversely with a competent lower esophageal sphincter. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of intestinal metaplasia is related to the severity of GERD.
