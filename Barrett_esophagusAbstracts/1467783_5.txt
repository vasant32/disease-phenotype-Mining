Oesophageal carcinoma has a very poor prognosis unless detected at a pre-symptomatic stage. This can only be done by screening and patients with Barrett's columnar lined epithelium of the oesophagus (CLO) are high risk candidates for an endoscopic screening programme. Surveillance studies in CLO patients, when reviewed, showed that the incidence of adenocarcinoma was between 1 in 52 and 1 in 81 patient years, with a mean of 1 in 76. This paper describes the Nottingham experience with an endoscopic screening programme that was established in 1976. To date it has detected four adenocarcinomas at a mean cost similar to that of detecting breast cancer by screening.
