Increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor linked with abnormalities of chromosome 7 has been described in a number of malignancies, but not in premalignant lesions. We report on one patient of nine studied with Barrett's esophagus who had trisomy 7 and showed increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the protooncogene c-erb-B, which encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, was not amplified. However, increased expression of the corresponding mRNA was evident on dot blot analysis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding studies were consistent with increased expression of the receptor with approximately 2.3 x 10(5) molecules of EGF bound per cell. These data suggest that chromosome 7 abnormalities can occur in Barrett's esophagus.
