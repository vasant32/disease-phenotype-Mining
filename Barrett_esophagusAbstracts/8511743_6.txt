A case of combined adenocarcinoma and carcinoid tumour which occurred in a patient with a Barrett's oesophagus is presented. Its significance is discussed in relation to the potential role of enterochromaffin-like cells in the development of oesophageal malignancy, and the possibility is raised that long term treatment with omeprazole, commonly used in this condition, could promote this.
