Currently, relatively safe, reliable resection techniques are available for most patients with esophageal carcinoma who present with nonmetastatic disease. For optimal results, the surgeon must be familiar with both transhiatal and transthoracic approaches and must individualize the approach depending on the tumor size and location and the patient's functional status. Whereas post-resection survival rates are good for patients with early-stage disease (Stage I or IIa), most patients present with locally advanced, Stage III disease. Although some progress has been made in the past decade in regard to early diagnosis among patients with Barrett's metaplasia undergoing endoscopic surveillance and additional progress has been made in adapting multimodality treatment programs successfully to patients with locally advanced disease, the overall cure rate for patients with esophageal carcinoma remains low.
