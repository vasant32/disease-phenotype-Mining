 BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the most serious complication of GERD. In BE patients, this observational study compares the effects of antireflux surgery versus antisecretory medical therapy. METHODS: Overall, 89 BE patients (long BE = 45; short BE = 44) were considered: 45 patients underwent antireflux surgery and 44 underwent medical therapy. At both initial and follow-up endoscopy, symptoms were assessed using a detailed questionnaire; BE phenotypic changes [intestinal metaplasia (IM) presence/type, Cdx2 expression] were assessed by histology (H&E), histochemistry (HID), and immunohistochemistry. Surgical failures were defined as follows: (1) abnormal 24-h pH monitoring results after surgery, (2) endoscopically evident recurrent esophagitis, and (3) recurrent hiatal hernia or slipped fundoplication on endoscopy or barium swallow. RESULTS: Reversion of IM was observed in 12/44 SSBE and 0/45 LSBE patients (p < 0.01). Reversion was more frequently observed after effective antireflux surgery than after medical treatment (p = 0.04). In patients with no further evidence of IM after therapy, Cdx2 expression was also absent (p = 0.02). The extent of IM was reduced, and the IM phenotype improved in SSBE patients after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with short BE (but not those with long BE) may benefit from surgically reducing the esophagus' exposure to GE reflux; among these patients, successful surgery carries a higher IM reversion rate than medical treatment.
