PURPOSE: Renal transplantation is associated with frequent gastrointestinal complications. Intestinal metaplasia is a feature of atrophic gastritis whereas the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is based on histological demonstration of specialized metaplasia. Both conditions are associated with increased risk of adenocarcinoma. The aim of the present study was to assess whether magnification endoscopy improves the diagnostic accuracy of intestinal metaplasia in stomach and in esophagus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this non-randomized, feasibility study thirty one (12 women and 19 men) renal transplant recipients, with a mean age of 44.0 years were evaluated for the presence of intestinal metaplasia. Standard esophagogastroscopy with methylene blue staining was followed by magnification endoscopy. The presence of gastritis and intestinal metaplasia was classified according to modified updated Sydney classification. RESULTS: Of 31 patients, 16 patients had endoscopic and histopathological evidence of gastric intestinal metaplasia, and standard endoscopy with methylene blue staining was sufficient for diagnosis (15 from 16). Magnification endoscopy allowed identification of 6 patients with specialized intestinal metaplasia in Barrett's esophagus, which would be otherwise missed. CONCLUSIONS: In this study diagnostic accuracy of standard endoscopy for identification of intestinal metaplasia in the stomach was not improved by the use of magnification endoscopy, but the latter was an accurate method of predicting specialized intestinal metaplasia in Barrett's esophagus. The use of magnification endoscopy in the clinical setting of renal transplantation needs further studies.
