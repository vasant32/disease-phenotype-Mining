 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alkaline reflux esophagitis is a complication that might develop in patients with total gastrectomy. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence and severity of reflux esophagitis and the occurence of complications (Barrett's esophagus and esophageal stenosis) in patients with total gastrectomy and Roux en Y esojejunostomy. METHODS: 92 patients with total gastrectomy performed for gastric cancer were included in the study. None of the patients had esophagitis prior to gastrectomy. The patients were assessed clinically and endoscopically after a certain interval from surgery. RESULTS: An important number of patients (14 out of 92, 15.22%) had reflux esophagitis; 5.43% of the patients had also complications of reflux esophagitis (Barrett's esophagus and benign esophageal stenosis) and 6.52% had local tumor recurrence. Of the 14 patients with reflux esophagitis, the majority (9/14) had Los Angeles (LA) grade C esophagitis. The mean interval between surgery and the endoscopic evaluation was 4.43 years. Barrett's esophagus and benign stenosis were diagnosed after a longer period of time (10.33 and 8 years, respectively) as compared to reflux esophagitis (5.29 years). More than half of the esophagitis patients had reflux symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Although Roux en Y esojejunostomy is a reconstructive technique which prevents the reflux, an important percentage of our patients developed alkaline reflux esophagitis. In most cases, the esophagitis was moderate or severe. Complications of alkaline reflux, i.e. benign stenosis and Barrett's esophagus, also occurred after longer periods of time (8 to 10 years) in a small percentage of patients.
