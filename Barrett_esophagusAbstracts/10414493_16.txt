Previous studies have shown that intratumoral microvessel density (IMD) correlates with clinical outcome in a variety of human neoplasms, such as those that arise in the breast, colon, and stomach, suggesting that angiogenesis is important in cancer progression. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prognostic utility of IMD in esophageal Barrett's-associated adenocarcinoma (AdCa) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and to determine the effect of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (chemrad) on this process. Tissue sections of tumor from 67 patients with esophageal carcinoma (45 with Barrett's-associated AdCa, 22 with SCC) were stained with the vascular marker CD31. The IMD was calculated by evaluating at least 5 different 200 x fields of tumor hot spot areas to obtain the mean microvessel count (MVC). The data then were correlated with the clinical and pathological features, chemrad status, and patient survival. The MVC was significantly higher in AdCa (143 +/- 63.2) compared with SCC (77.2 +/- 38.6, P = 0.0001). In AdCa, no correlation was noted between the MVC and any of the clinical or pathological features, including chemrad status. In contrast, in SCC, a statistically significant higher MVC was detected in patients who did not receive chemrad (97.2 +/- 37.3) compared with those who did (48.3 +/- 15.9, P = .002) and in tumors that were larger in size (P = .02). However, the MVC did not correlate with survival in either AdCa or SCC (P > .05). The degree of angiogenesis is not a significant prognostic indicator in either esophageal AdCa or SCC. Preoperative chemrad has a positive effect on reducing the degree of angiogenesis in esophageal carcinoma, particularly SCC.
