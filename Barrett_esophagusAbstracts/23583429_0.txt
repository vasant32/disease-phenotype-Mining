 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Understanding the causes of death in people with Barrett's esophagus (BE) could guide evidence-based practice in the follow-up of these patients. METHODS: We identified individuals diagnosed with BE in the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked their information with that from England's Hospital Episode Statistics database. Eligible patients (N = 8448) were matched with individuals without BE for age, sex, and general practice (controls, N = 155,212). Causes of death were obtained from the UK's Office for National Statistics. Cox proportional hazard regression, excluding data from the first year of follow-up, was used to estimate hazard ratios and cumulative mortality. Absolute excess risks were calculated by subtracting cause-specific mortality values of controls from those of patients with BE. RESULTS: Compared with the control population, patients with BE had increased risks of death from neoplasms and from respiratory and digestive causes but not from circulatory disorders. The annual mortality rate from esophageal cancer among patients with BE was 0.14%; 4.5% of deaths among these patients resulted from this cancer, leading to a cumulative 10-year risk of almost 2%. Nonetheless, the largest single cause of death among patients with BE was ischemic heart disease (5.6 per 1000 patients); 168 patients with BE died of this cause, nearly 4-fold the number that died of esophageal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with BE, approximately 2% will die of esophageal cancer within 10 years. However, patients with BE died more frequently of other causes, such as ischemic heart disease. Evidence-based strategies are available to prevent this disease and might be more cost-effective for reducing mortality among patients with BE.
