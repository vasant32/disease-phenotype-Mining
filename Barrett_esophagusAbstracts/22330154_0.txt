Interesting advances are always reported in Digestive Disease Week. This year's studies on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) stressed the role of weight gain and psychological factors in both symptom production and lack of treatment response. In Barrett's esophagus, radiofrequency ablation has become the treatment of choice in cases associated with dysplasia or neoplasms in situ. Finally, notable studies of eosinophilic esophagitis highlighted the difficulty of distinguishing between this entity and GERD. Topical steroids and exclusion diets are effective therapeutic alternatives.
