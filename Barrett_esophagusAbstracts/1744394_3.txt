A 70-year-old woman with no previous gastroesophageal surgery gave a 6-month history of dysphagia. Barium studies suggested a diagnosis of achalasia. Esophageal manometry showed absence of peristalsis and a high lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Endoscopy showed a dilated esophagus with food residue, and Barrett's esophagus was present. The association of Barrett's esophagus and achalasia must be rare.
