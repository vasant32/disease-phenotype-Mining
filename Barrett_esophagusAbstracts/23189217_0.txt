Endoscopy is an indispensible diagnostic and therapeutic instrument for gastrointestinal diseases. Endocytoscopy and confocal endomicroscopy are two types of ultra high magnification endoscopy techniques. Standard endoscopy allows for 50 × magnification, whereas endocytoscopy can magnify up to 1400 × and confocal endomicroscopy can magnify up to 1000 ×. These methods open the realm of real time microscopic evaluation of the GI tract, including cellular and subcellular structures. Confocal endomicroscopy has the additional advantage of being able to visualize subsurface structures. The use of high magnification endoscopy in conjunction with standard endoscopy allows for a real-time microscopic assessment of areas with macroscopic abnormalities, providing "virtual biopsies" with valuable information about cellular and subcellular changes. This can minimize the number of biopsies taken at the time of endoscopy. The use of this technology may assist in detecting pre-malignant or malignant changes at an earlier state, allowing for earlier intervention and treatment. High magnification endoscopy has shown promising results in clinical trials for Barrett's esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell cancer, gastric cancer, celiac disease, colorectal cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. As the use of high magnification endoscopy techniques increases, the clinical applications will increase as well. Of the two systems, only confocal endomicroscopy is currently commercially available. Like all new technologies there will be an initial learning curve before operators become proficient in obtaining high quality images and discerning abnormal from normal pathology. Validated criteria for the diagnosis of the various gastrointestinal diseases will need to be developed for each method. In this review, the basic principles of both modalities are discussed, along with their clinical applicability and limitations.
