 OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER)related complications after correction of esophageal atresia (EA). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The association of EA and GER in children is well known. However, little is known about the prevalence of GER and its potential complications in adults who have undergone correction of EA as a child. METHODS: Prospective analysis of the prevalence of GER and its complications over 28 years after correction of EA by means of a questionnaire, esophagogastroscopy, and histologic evaluation of esophageal biopsies. RESULTS: The questionnaire was returned by 38 (95%) of 40 patients. A quarter of the patients had no complaints. Swallowing solid food was a problem for 13 patients (34%), and mashed foods for 2 (5%). Heartburn was experienced by 7 patients (18%), retrosternal pain by 8 (21%). However, none of the patients were using antireflux medication. Twenty-three patients (61%) agreed to undergo esophagogastroscopy, which showed macroscopic Barrett esophagus in 1 patient, which was confirmed by histology. One patient developed complaints of dysphagia at the end of the study. A squamous cell esophageal carcinoma was diagnosed and treated by transthoracic subtotal esophagectomy. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high incidence of GER-related complications after correction of EA, but it is still very disputable if all EA patients should be screened at an adult age.
