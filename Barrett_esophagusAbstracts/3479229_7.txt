Barrett's esophagus, a columnar metaplasia of the lower esophagus that is usually associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GER), was found in three children on long-term antileukemia chemotherapy. Two of the children had been on a standard acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) maintenance protocol with 2 to 3 years of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine administration. The third child received daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and 6-thioguanine for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). None of the patients had clinical or pathologic evidence of GER disease. We propose that the Barrett's esophagus in these patients did not result from the usual peptic esophagitis, but rather from chemotherapy-induced esophageal mucosal injury.
