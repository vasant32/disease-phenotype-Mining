Barrett's oesophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion to adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus. Understanding of the molecular alterations in this multistage process may contribute to improved diagnosis and treatment. Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular protein that modulates cell adhesion and growth. Alterations in SPARC expression have been observed in a variety of solid tumours. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and timing of SPARC mRNA expression in Barrett's multistage disease and to investigate the impact of SPARC alterations on the development and progression of this disease. SPARC mRNA expression was measured using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR method in 108 specimens from 19 patients with BE without carcinoma, 20 patients with Barrett's-associated adenocarcinoma (EA), and a control group (CG) of 10 patients without evidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The median SPARC mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in BE tissues compared to paired normal oesophagus (NE) tissues for the BE group (P=0.004) and for the EA group (P<0.001). The SPARC mRNA expression was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus compared to matching NE tissue and compared to Barrett's tissues in the EA group (P<0.001). Furthermore, SPARC expression values were significantly different between metaplastic and dysplastic Barrett's tissues (P=0.014). In histologically normal squamous oesophagus tissues obtained from carcinoma patients (EA group), the SPARC mRNA expression was significantly higher compared to NE mucosa from the BE group and the CG group (P=0.03). These findings suggest that the upregulation of SPARC mRNA expression is an early event in the development and progression of BE and EA, and that high SPARC expression may be a clinically useful biomarker for the detection of occult adenocarcinoma, and that a widespread 'field effect' is present in the NE of patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
