Patients with Barrett's esophagus are frequently treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Those that undergo this procedure have a low risk of developing subsquamous intestinal metaplasia, and none have been reported to develop subsquamous dysplasia or cancer. We report the development of subsquamous neoplasia in 3 patients who were treated with RFA for Barrett's esophagus (2 developed adenocarcinoma and 1 developed high-grade dysplasia). The identification of these cases indicates the need for continued surveillance following RFA, even after complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia, and caution for widespread use of ablation, especially in patients with low-risk Barrett's esophagus.
