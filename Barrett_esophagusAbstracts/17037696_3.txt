The occurrence of strains resistant to metronidazole is causing failure of the 4-drug regimen for eradication of Helicobacter pylori in the Islamic Republic of Iran. This study compared the in vitro efficacy of furazolidone with metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin and tetracycline in 70 H. pylori isolates from dyspeptic patients. Of the isolates, 33% were resistant to metronidazole but all were susceptible to furazolidone. Furazolidone could be considered as an appropriate substitute for metronidazole for H. pylori infections.
