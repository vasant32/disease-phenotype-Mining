In order to determine the molecular genetic alterations associated with tumor invasion, Barrett's adenocarcinoma and its non-invasive precursor lesions were investigated by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Along the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in Barrett's adenocarcinoma gains on 7q, 8q, 20q, 2p, 10q and 17q, and losses on Y, 4q, 5q, 9p 18q and 14q became steadily more frequent. FISH demonstrated increasing DNA copy of numbers of c-erbB-2, 20q13.2 (AIB), c-myc and cyclin D1 during the development of Barrett's adenocarcinoma, and LOH confirmed DNA losses on 5q21 (APC) and 18q (DCC). Some of the chromosomal changes of the non-invasive precursor lesions were significantly different from the alterations detected in invasive carcinoma. Although molecular pathology may be used as diagnostic adjunct in future, the histopathological determination of invasion remains the most important diagnostic criterion of malignancy in Barrett's adenocarcinoma.
