 BACKGROUND: Preliminary studies with qualitative detection methods suggest that 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX fluorescence might improve the detection of dysplastic Barrett's epithelium. This study used quantitative methods to determine whether aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX fluorescence can differentiate between Barrett's mucosa with and without dysplasia. METHODS: Patients were given 10 mg/kg of aminolevulinic acid orally 3 hours before endoscopy. Quantitative fluorescence spectra were acquired by using a nitrogen-pumped dye laser (l 400 nm) spectrograph system. The protoporphyrin IX fluorescence intensity at 635 nm was compared with the histopathologic diagnosis for mucosal biopsy specimens taken immediately after the fluorescence measurements. RESULTS: Ninety-seven spectra were obtained from 20 patients. The mean (+/- standard error) standardized protoporphyrin IX fluorescence intensity was significantly greater (p < 0.05) for high-grade dysplastic Barrett's epithelium (0.29 +/- 0.07, n = 13) than for nondysplastic Barrett's epithelium (0.11 +/- 0.02, n = 43). By using protoporphyrin IX fluorescence alone, high-grade dysplasia was distinguished from nondysplastic tissue types with 77% sensitivity and 71% specificity. Decreased autofluorescence was particularly found in nodular high-grade dysplasia. By using the fluorescence intensity ratio of 635 nm/480 nm, nodular high-grade dysplasia could be differentiated from nondysplastic tissue with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. CONCLUSION: Protoporphyrin IX fluorescence may be useful for identifying areas of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus and for targeting of biopsies.
