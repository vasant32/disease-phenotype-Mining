Three hundred multiphasic examinations of the lower esophagus and esophagogastric region were assessed to determine the individual sensitivities of the full-column, mucosal relief, and double-contrast techniques in the detection of common structural abnormalities, such as hiatal hernia, lower esophageal rings, and peptic strictures. In 159 patients, there were 211 structural abnormalities including 153 hiatal hernias, 35 mucosal rings, 20 peptic strictures, and 3 esophageal diverticula. The overall sensitivity of the full-column technique in detecting these abnormalities was 100% compared to 52% and 34% for the mucosal relief and double-contrast techniques, respectively. We conclude that the prone full-column technique must be incorporated into any examination of the esophagogastric region if these common abnormalities are to be demonstrated reliably.
