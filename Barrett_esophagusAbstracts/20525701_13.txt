 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic resection is safe and effective to remove early neoplasia (ie,high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia/early cancer) in Barrett's oesophagus. To prevent metachronous lesions during follow-up, the remaining Barrett's oesophagus can be removed by stepwise radical endoscopic resection (SRER). The aim was to evaluate the combined experience in four tertiary referral centres with SRER to eradicate Barrett's oesophagus with early neoplasia. METHODS:  DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Four tertiary referral centres. PARTICIPANTS: 169 patients (151 males, age 64 years (IQR 57-71), Barrett's oesophagus 3 cm (IQR 2-5)) with early neoplasia in Barrett's oesophagus < or = 5 cm, without deep submucosal infiltration or lymph node metastases, treated by SRER between January 2000 and September 2006. INTERVENTION: Endoscopic resection every 4-8 weeks, until complete endoscopic and histological eradication of Barrett's oesophagus and neoplasia. RESULTS: According to intention-to-treat analysis complete eradication of all neoplasia and all intestinal metaplasia by the end of the treatment phase was reached in 97.6% (165/169) and 85.2% (144/169) of patients, respectively. One patient had progression of neoplasia during treatment and died of metastasised adenocarcinoma (0.6%). After median follow-up of 32 months (IQR 19-49), complete eradication of neoplasia and intestinal metaplasia was sustained in 95.3% (161/169) and 80.5% (136/169) of patients, respectively. Acute, severe complications occurred in 1.2% of patients, and 49.7% of patients developed symptomatic stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: SRER of Barrett's oesophagus < or = 5 cm containing early neoplasia appears to be an effective treatment modality with a low rate of recurrent lesions during follow-up. The procedure, however, is technically demanding and is associated with oesophageal stenosis in half of the patients.
