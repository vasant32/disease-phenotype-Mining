 BACKGROUND: We investigated Quality of Life (QoL) and Johnsson & DeMeester score of patients after Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2007 to June 2008, 43 patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux underwent laparoscopic Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication; 7 were lost during the follow-up. Patients underwent endoscopy, 24-hour pH-metry, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-Health-Related Quality-of-Life (GERD-HRQL), and Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaires preoperatively, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: Endoscopic findings revealed complete healing of esophagitis in all patients. Barrett esophagus was still present. Six patients reported persistence of symptoms but postoperative pH-metry and endoscopy showed the absence of reflux; 2 patients (5.5%) were still on proton pump inhibitor therapy at 12 months. Seven patients (19.4%) reported dysphagia for solids for at least 3 months. Readmission for dysphagia was required for 2 (5.5%) and 1 patient underwent endoscopic dilatation. At 6 and 12 months, no dysphagia was reported. During the follow-up, no gas-bloat syndrome was reported. The Johnsson & DeMeester score and QoL measurement obtained from GERD-HRQL and SF-36 revealed a significant improvement in the related domain. At 6 months, 23 patients (63.8%) were completely satisfied and after 12 months, 30 patients (83.3%) were satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication is safe and effective for the treatment of GERD, improving QoL.
