This is a case report of the ultrasonic detection of an enlarged urinary bladder in a 20 1/2 week fetus which subsequently was proven to have the prune belly or Eagle-Barrett syndrome. Serial sonograms were used to follow the progress of this abnormal pregnancy and were instrumental in the subsequent clinical management of the patient.
