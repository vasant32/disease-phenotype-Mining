In children, excess of gastroesophageal reflux causes lesions of the esophageal mucosa that we have studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM respectively) in 27 grasp biopsies prelevated during endoscopic procedures. Ultrastructural lesions can be graded on the basis of their severity. In grade I, epithelial cells are well preserved in the deepest layers whereas the superficial cells display ultrastructural alterations such as irregular microridges or reduced intercellular junctions. In grade II, the surface is composed of extruding cells and in the intermediate layer, large intercellular spaces containing lympho-monocytic cells are visible. In grade III, the mucosal surface is characterized by crater-like erosions, degenerating cells are visible in all the layers; in two patients columnar epithelium-lined areas (Barrett's esophagus) have been identified. Our results suggest that in patients with reflux esophagitis, ultrastructural examination of grasp biopsies prelevated by pediatric endoscopes allows a grading of the anatomical lesions providing data that can not be obtained by conventional histology.
