In 12 patients the endoscopic examination raised the suspicion of Barrett's syndrome. By means of guided biopsies and static scintigraphy with gamma camera and 99m-technetium pertechnetate ectopic gastric mucosa was found in the esophagus of 5 of the patients. In one patient a Barrett's ulcer was found. The establishment of a focus of increased radioactivity proximal from the stomach by static scintigraphy is a proof for the presence of ectopic gastric mucosa in the esophagus. Because of the high risk of malignancy a systemic endoscopic biopsy control is necessary for the patients with proved columnar-cell metaplasia in the esophagus.
