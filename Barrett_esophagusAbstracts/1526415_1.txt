Flow cytometry was used to examine the spatial distribution of nuclear DNA content in Barrett's mucosa, in one patient with high grade dysplasia and in 6 patients with Barrett's adenocarcinoma. All tumors were aneuploid. Each adenocarcinoma but the most advanced seemed to arise from a single clone of aneuploid or near-tetraploid cells which was found in all biopsy specimens taken from the tumor. Multiple aneuploid populations of cells were seen in the larger tumors. Eight clones were individualized in the most advanced case of cancer. In all patients with carcinoma, the mucosa surrounding the tumor was aneuploid. Some areas were characterized by the same DNA index as in the tumor, others contained distinct aneuploid cell populations. The spatial distributions of aneuploid clones and dysplastic areas were not perfectly superimposed. These data suggest that neoplastic progression in Barrett's esophagus is associated with genomic instability preceding the development of malignancy. Clonal heterogeneity in Barrett's adenocarcinoma is more marked when compared to other tumors and suggests a majoration of genomic instability during tumor progression.
