 BACKGROUND: Evidence-based selection criteria for endoscopic resection (ER) of Barrett's neoplasia are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To study the histopathology of ER specimens of Barrett's neoplasia and correlate this with endoscopic characteristics to make recommendations for patient management. DESIGN, SETTING, INTERVENTIONS: Histology and correlating endoscopy reports of specimens obtained at 293 consecutive ERs performed at a Dutch tertiary referral center between 2000 and 2006 were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Histologic findings in ER specimens and their relation with endoscopic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 150 ERs were performed for focal lesions: 16% type 0-I, 23% 0-IIa, 7% 0-IIb, 3% 0-IIc, 9% 0-IIa-IIb, and 42% 0-IIa-IIc; and 143 for flat mucosa. Histology revealed no dysplasia in 57 ERs, low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia in 52, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia in 104, T1m in 61, and T1sm in 17; in two cancers, infiltration depth was not assessable because of artifacts. Type 0-I and 0-IIc lesions significantly more often penetrated the submucosa (P = .009): 60% were G1 cancers, 23% were G2 cancers, and 18% were G3 cancers. G2-G3 cancers significantly more often invaded the submucosa (P < .001) or had positive vertical margins (P = .015). Histology of ER specimens led to a change in diagnosis in 49% of the focal lesions and a relevant change in treatment policy in 30%. LIMITATIONS: A retrospective study. CONCLUSIONS: ER is a valuable diagnostic tool that frequently leads to a change in treatment policy. Most endoscopically resected early Barrett's neoplasia are 0-II type, G1 mucosal neoplasia. Submucosal infiltration is more often encountered in type 0-I and 0-IIc lesions and in G2-G3 cancers.
