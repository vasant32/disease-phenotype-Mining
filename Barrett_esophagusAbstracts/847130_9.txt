A review of 26 cases of columnar-lined (Barrett's) esophagus suggests that this lesion is more common than generally appreciated, usually arising consequent to reflux esophagitis. The radiologically detectable lesions frequently do not support the idea that Barrett's esophagus presents only with high esophageal ulcer and/or stricture. Hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux, stricture, ulcers, and even minor mucosal abnormalities may be present alone or in combination, and may be variably located.
