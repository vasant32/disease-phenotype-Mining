The work is based on an analysis of results of treatment of 643 children with gastroesophageal reflux (operations were performed on 69 of them). Methods of anesthesia are described. Conservative treatment was used in correlation with the degree of reflux-esophagitis. Indications to operations were considered to be as follows: hiatal hernias, reflux-esophagitis in children with cerebral paralysis, failure of conservative treatment in the group of children having no anatomical causes of the reflux. A method of surgical treatment is proposed including a combination of fundoplication with the posterior gastropexy and fixation of the esophagus to the diaphragm at a distance of 3 cm from the gastric cuff (43 cases, no recurrences). In patients with a combination of gastroesophageal reflux with the esophagus stenosis resection of the altered portion was made followed by plasty with a colonic transplant or local tissues (10 patients with the diagnosed Barrett esophagus).
