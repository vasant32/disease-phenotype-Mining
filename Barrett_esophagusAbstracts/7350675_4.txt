Carcinoma of the esophagus is found more commonly in association with head and neck tumors, lye stricture, achalasia, and Barrett esophagus than in the general population. Our experience with these associated entities in a population of 680 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus is reviewed. Carcinoma of the esophagus has traditionally had a very poor prognosis which continues to the present. Routine periodic use of double contrast esophagography is advocated to screen populations containing these associated high-risk entities. This may ultimately increase survival through diagnosis of earlier stages of carcinoma of the esophagus.
