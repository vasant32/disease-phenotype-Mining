 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Barrett's esophageal cancer is usually included in gastroesophageal (GE) junction adenocarcinoma in Japanese people. No study on the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophageal cancer in comparison with GE junction adenocarcinoma other than Barrett's esophageal cancer has been reported in Japan. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and pathological characteristics and gastric acid secretion of Barrett's esophageal cancer and GE junction adenocarcinoma other than Barrett's esophageal cancer in Japanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with Barrett's esophageal cancer and 23 patients with GE junction adenocarcinoma other than Barrett's esophageal cancer were enrolled in this study. We evaluated and compared them by assessing the Helicobactor pylori (HP) infection status and gastric acid secretion using the endoscopic gastrin test (EGT). RESULTS: In the patients with Barrett's esophageal cancer, no significant difference was found in the mean EGT value between HP-positive and -negative patients, but in the patients with GE junction adenocarcinoma other than Barrett's esophageal cancer, the mean EGT value in HP-positive patients was significantly lower than that in HP-negative patients. CONCLUSION: Two distinct types of cancer of different origin may be mixed in GE junction adenocarcinomas. One is Barrett's esophageal cancer associated with high gastric acid secretion and reflux of gastric acid into the esophagus, the other is cancer resembling distal gastric cancer associated with gastric atrophy and low gastric acid secretion.
