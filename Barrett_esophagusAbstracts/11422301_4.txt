Acidic fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) is sequentially accumulated in Barrett's esophagus and its expression in glandular dysplasias is independent of esophageal adenocarcinoma. This suggests that FGF-1 immunohistochemistry could be used as an adjunct to the routine histopathologic diagnosis of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus. The data also underscore the important role of fibroblast growth factors in tumorigenesis.
