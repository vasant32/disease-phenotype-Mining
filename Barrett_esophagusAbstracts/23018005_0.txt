Digestive Disease Week always offers interesting advances. Among the notable advances concerning gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in the 2012 meeting were studies on its association with functional dyspepsia. Furthermore, novel data suggest that undetected reflux plays a role in certain extraesophageal diseases. We also discuss the potential utility of impedanciometry of the esophageal mucosa in the diagnosis of GERD and review the management and implications of lack of response to proton pump inhibitors. We also review promising new techniques for screening for esophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus and new data on the efficacy and durability of radiofrequency ablation as the treatment of choice in cases associated with dysplasia or neoplasia in situ.
