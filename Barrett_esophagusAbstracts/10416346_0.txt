Oesophageal cancer includes two distinct tumours: squamous cell cancer is related to alcohol and tobacco consumption; adenocarcinoma develops on a metaplastic columnar mucosa lining the oesophagus (Barrett's oesophagus). In Western countries the ratio of the 2 tumors is 6 to 4. Dysphagia is a late symptom in the evolution and corresponds in most cases to advanced cancer with poor prognosis. Treatment decision required evaluation of the performance status, search for associated tumors (mouth, pharynx and respiratory tract), and evaluation of the locoregional extension of the primary tumour. In the absence of dysphagia, detection of oesophageal cancer at an early stage is compatible with a curative option.
