BACKGROUND: From 1972 to 1996, bowel interposition reconstruction after esophagectomy for benign and malignant conditions was performed in 129 of 131 patients. The indication for operation was benign disease in 94 patients (72.9%) and malignant disease in 35 patients (27.1%). Benign stricture was the most common presentation in the benign group (41 patients), and adenocarcinoma was the most common indication in the malignant group (19 patients). METHODS: One hundred thirty-three conduits were performed in the 129 patients. Four patients (3.1%) required reoperative reconstruction. Of the 97 conduits employed for reconstruction of benign disease, the right colon was used in 70 patients, the left colon in 9 patients, and the transverse colon in 4 patients. A jejunal interposition graft was employed in 11 patients and a free jejunal autograft in 3 patients. The right colon was used in 15 patients with malignant disease, the left colon in 9 patients, and the jejunum in 12 patients. RESULTS: The mean age of the population was 54.5 years (range, 14 to 72 years) with a male-to-female ratio of 1.3:1. The average number of prior thoracic or abdominal procedures was 2.9 (range, 1 to 8) with 50.9% of patients undergoing reoperation. The mean length of stay was 21.7 days (range, 8 to 290 days). Complications occurred in 37.1% of patients with anastomotic leak occurring in 14.8% and ischemic colitis in 3.0% of conduits performed. The in-hospital mortality was 5.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Bowel interposition reconstruction after esophagectomy for benign and malignant disease can be performed with an acceptable morbidity and mortality, despite prior operative procedures in the abdomen or chest. Colonic and jejunal conduits, employed alone or in combination, can effectively restore gastrointestinal continuity.
