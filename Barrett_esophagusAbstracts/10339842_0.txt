OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett's esophagus and to study the characteristics in these patients. METHODS: Between January 1988 and June 1997 was diagnosed 46 patients with Barrett's esophagus. In all tem was analyzed the age, the follow-up period, the chief presenting symptoms leading to endoscopy, endoscopy esophagitis and complications of Barrett's esophagus. RESULTS: The mean age at the time of Barrett's diagnosis was 58 years. The mean follow-up period was 43 months. Presenting symptoms were heartburn in 35 (76%) patients, dysphagia in 3 (6.5%), thoracic pain 3 (6.5%), hemorrhage 2 (4.5%) and others in 3 (6.5%). Endoscopic esophagitis was present in 24 (52%) patients during the follow-up. Complications developed was stricture, ulceration or haemorrhage in 14 (30.4%) patients, two (4.3%) have adenocarcinoma and one dysplasia. Incidence of adenocarcinoma was 1/82 patient-years of follow-up. All three patients with adenocarcinoma or dysplasia was males. Two of the three presented with heartburn and the mean follow-up until development of dysplasia or cancer was 63 months. CONCLUSIONS: Heartburn and endoscopic esophagitis is frequent in these patients. The risk of development of and adenocarcinoma or others complications is high.
