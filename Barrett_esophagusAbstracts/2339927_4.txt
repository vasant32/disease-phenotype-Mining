Between 1978 and 1988, 88 patients were referred for the surgical treatment of nonmalignant Barrett's esophagus. Nineteen patients required esophageal resection. Male/female ratio was 13:6; age range was 13 to 84 years (mean age, 49.8 years; median age, 40 years). Preoperative studies demonstrated strictures in 11 patients and ulcers in 7. Penetrating Barrett's ulcer resistant to treatment was the indication for resection in 5 patients. Ulcers penetrated to the pericardium (1 patient), pulmonary vein (1), lung (1), and mediastinum (2). Other indications for resection included undilatable strictures (2), previous operations (4), high-grade dysplasia (3), parietal cells lining the esophagus (1), patient's refusal of long-term surveillance (2), and the inability to exclude adenocarcinoma preoperatively (2). Reconstruction was achieved by colon interposition (15) or esophagogastrostomy (4), with one postoperative death. Mean follow-up was 41 months and was 100% complete. Of the 18 patients, 3 have occasional regurgitation but none have any dysphagia or weight loss. Esophageal resection is indicated in a select group of patients with Barrett's esophagus. Absolute indications include a deep penetrating ulcer confirmed intraoperatively, high-grade dysplasia, strong suspicion of cancer, and multiple previous operations. Relative indications include strictures not responding to dilation and young patients refusing long-term surveillance.
