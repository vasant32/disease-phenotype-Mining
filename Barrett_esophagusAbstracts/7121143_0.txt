For precise differentiation between organic and functional disorders of the oesophagus, the gastroenterologist makes use of radiology, endoscopy, and manometry, although a questionnaire may establish the final diagnosis in dysphagia with 95% accuracy. Combined therapy is gaining in increasing importance, such as dilatation of achalasia, bouginage of peptic strictures, implantation of prostheses and sclerosing of varices during endoscopy. For early diagnosis of carcinoma, close interdisciplinary cooperation between the ENT-specialist and the gastroenterologist is mandatory in panendoscopy of the squamous epithelium-lined aero-digestive system.
