Goals of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) treatment are symptom relief, healing of esophagitis, prevention of complications, and prevention of relapses. The aims of the current study were to evaluate a selected group of patients referred to our Department of General Surgery for presurgical examination (N = 70: 41 males and 29 females) for their expectations about laparoscopic antireflux surgery and to compare these expectations with the official medical treatment goals. The leading expectations for laparoscopic antireflux surgery were as follows: (1) for 92.8%, abatement of GERD-related symptoms, especially heartburn, regurgitation, and pain; (2) for 84.3%, a return to normal daily activities and life such as eating and drinking habits, sleeping habits, or work-related aspects; (3) for 72.9%, an improvement in quality of life; (4) for 52.9%, a successful surgical intervention without any complications or side effects; and (5) for 48.6%, protection from a Barrett esophagus and cancer risk. In contrast, only two patients answered that they would expect normalization of pH values and healing of esophagitis. The data show that the majority of patients have clear expectations about laparoscopic antireflux surgery. These expectations are partly related to official medical treatment goals. In general, patient-related aspects of outcome concerning expectations should be included as a standard in all official goals of GERD treatment and also in medical outcome studies. One of these aspects should absolutely be patients' quality of life.
