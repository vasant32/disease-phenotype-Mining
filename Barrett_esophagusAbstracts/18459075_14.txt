 BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Radiofrequency ablation is a rapidly evolving therapeutic modality for Barrett's esophagus. The aim of this ongoing 12-month trial is to assess Barrett's esophagus eradication after radiofrequency ablation using a balloon-based (HALO-360) and a plate-based (HALO-90) device. We report here our experience with the first 10 patients (out of 40) who have completed 12 months of follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Following radiofrequency ablation using the HALO-360 device all patients were maintained on double-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy. Endoscopic evaluation was performed at 3 and 12 months postablation. Patients with residual Barrett's esophagus at 3 months underwent repeat ablation. Ten patients, seven with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus, two with low-grade and one with high-grade dysplasia have completed the study to date. RESULTS: Complete Barrett's esophagus eradication was achieved in seven patients, and partial eradication was achieved in three. There were no major complications. One case of buried Barrett's metaplasia was encountered and successfully re-ablated, with complete Barrett's esophagus eradication achieved at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, Barrett's eradication rates were comparable to previously published reports. One case of buried Barrett's metaplasia was identified out of 247 biopsies and was eradicated with repeat ablation.
