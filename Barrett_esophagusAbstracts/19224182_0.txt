We report outcomes of en bloc esophageal resection with a thoracoscopically assisted laparotomy approach. The operation data were as follows: 41 thoracoscopically assisted procedures, 41 intrathoracic anastomoses, conversion rate 0, 100% R0 resection rate, 25 (15-52) lymph node retrievals, leak rate 2, and one mortality. From these results we conclude that minimally invasive esophagectomy with high intrathoracic anastomosis is a safe procedure. The R0 resection rate, lymph node retrieval, and operating time are comparable with those of the open abdominothoracic approach.
