Primary adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, previously considered a rare neoplasm, has shown a dramatic increase in its incidence rate among White men in the United States since 1970. The reason for this increase is unknown. Since the presence of Barrett's esophagus is essential for the development of most esophageal adenocarcinomas, the increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma may be related to an increasing prevalence of Barrett's esophagus, and its precursor, gastroesophageal reflux. An association between this increasing incidence and an increasing use of pharmaceutical agents that relax the lower esophageal sphincter is proposed. The data on the dollar amount and approximate quantity in milligrams purchased per capita through retail pharmacies and hospitals in the United States from 1957 to 1986 are presented for four categories of such agents. An upward trend is observed for all four categories.
