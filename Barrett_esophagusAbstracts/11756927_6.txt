 BACKGROUND: High-frequency catheter US probes provide greater accuracy compared with dedicated echoendoscopes in the staging of superficial esophageal carcinoma. However, it may be difficult and time consuming to obtain acoustic coupling with these devices. The aim of this study was to test a novel catheter US technique for staging superficial esophageal carcinoma. METHODS: Twelve patients underwent examination with a 2-channel endoscope. US images were obtained with a catheter US probe (20 MHz) fitted with a balloon sheath. RESULTS: Adequate endoscopic and catheter US images were obtained in all patients. Depth of tumor invasion as determined with the catheter US probe was confirmed in all 5 patients who underwent surgery. No procedure-related complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: US with a catheter US probe and sheath allows complete endoscopic examination and preoperative determination of depth of invasion of superficial esophageal carcinoma in a single endoscopic procedure. Preliminary results suggest this technique is accurate and safe.
