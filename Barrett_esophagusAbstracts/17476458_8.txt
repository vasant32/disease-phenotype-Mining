Reflux esophagitis (RE) and Barrett's esophagus (BE) belong to the most common esophageal complications of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes play an important role in cellular protection against oxidative stress and toxic foreign chemicals. Therefore, we investigated the hypothesis that polymorphisms in genes for these detoxifying enzymes could influence susceptibility to RE and BE. GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 loci were analyzed by PCR-based methods in 64 patients with RE (and an additional group of 22 subjects with BE as the fourth grade of esophagitis) and 173 unrelated controls. There were no significant differences in the distributions of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes between the controls and patients with RE or BE. Similarly, frequencies of GSTP1 alleles were non-significantly different between the control and RE groups. However, GSTP1 B allele carriers were more frequent among the patients with BE compared to those in the reflux esophagitis group (P=0.04, OR=2.10, 95% CI 0.99-4.44) and most significantly when compared to the controls (P=0.0067, Pcorr<0.05, OR=2.56, 95%CI 1.30-5.05). Although the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes did not show any relationship with reflux disease, the GSTP1 gene might be one of the risk factors associated with susceptibility to RE, especially to BE.
