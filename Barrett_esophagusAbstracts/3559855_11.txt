Columnar epithelium-lined esophagus is an acquired phenomenon arising secondarily to chronic mucosal injury from gastroesophageal reflux. This report documents 11 children with complications of reflux and the histologic finding of gastric mucosa in the esophagus. Five children had strictures, one requiring esophageal replacement and four treated by antireflux surgery followed by sleeve-resection of a short fibrotic stricture. Specimens from two patients showed mild dysplasia and from six others slight nuclear atypia. Intestinal metaplasia was apparent in one case on routine histology and was revealed in six other cases by mucin histochemical strains. The significance of the histopathologic findings is discussed in the context of possible malignant potential.
