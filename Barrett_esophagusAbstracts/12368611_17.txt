 OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome of Nissen fundoplication surgery for the treatment of patients with chronic extraesophageal manifestations of reflux (EER). METHODS: A retrospective medical record analysis was performed. Patient demographics, extraesophageal disease secondary to gastroesophageal reflux (GER), methods of GER diagnosis, acid suppression therapy before antireflux surgery, and response to surgical intervention were evaluated. RESULTS: The charts of 29 patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication surgery for EER were included in the study. Hoarseness was present in 17 patients; laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) was the most common diagnosis (n = 20). Barium esophagram was done in all patients and revealed abnormalities indicative of GER in 26 patients. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory pH study was done in 27 patients and pharyngeal reflux was present in 19. Preoperative esophageal endoscopy was performed in 22 patients. This study revealed evidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in 14 patients with 8 having evidence of Barrett's esophagus. Sixteen of the 29 patients had symptoms or findings of GERD. Twenty-eight patients had laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) and 1 had an open procedure. Twenty-five of the 29 patients (follow-up ranging from 6-108 mo) had excellent results with near-total freedom from symptoms and are taking no acid-suppressive medications. CONCLUSIONS: GER has an important role in the cause of many otolaryngologic and pulmonary disorders. Nissen fundoplication is an effective modality to treat EER in selected cases.
