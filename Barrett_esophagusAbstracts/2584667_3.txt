An alcoholic man with known reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus developed fever, epigastric pain, subcutaneous crepitus, and leukocytosis from an esophageal perforation at a Barrett's ulcer. Possible risk factors for perforation in this patient included alcoholism, severe gastroesophageal reflux, corticosteroid therapy, noncompliance with antacid and H2 blocker therapy, and the presence of acid-secreting parietal cells in the Barrett's epithelium. Five cases of this complication have previously been reported in a review of the literature, which included 536 cases of Barrett's esophagus or esophageal perforation. This entity may present with a clinical triad of a patient (a) in acute distress with fever and epigastric or noncardiac chest pain and without signs of peritonitis, (b) with symptoms of or known gastroesophageal reflux, and (c) with chest examination revealing subcutaneous crepitus, or chest roentgenogram revealing subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, or hydropneumothorax.
