The pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR), derived directly from videofluoroscopy without the need for manometry, requires validation as a surrogate for pharyngeal strength. A correlation of -0.70 was previously identified between PCR and pharyngeal clearing pressures (PP) on separate fluoroscopic and manometric studies. As PP increases, PCR decreases. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the correlation between PCR and PP in 25 patients undergoing simultaneous fluoroscopy and pharyngeal manometry. The effect of the manometric catheter on PCR was also investigated. The correlation between the PCR and averaged pharyngeal clearing pressures was -0.72 (p<0.001). All patients with a PCR>0.25 had a P <60 mmHg. PCR did not differ significantly as a consequence of the manometric catheter. Results suggest the utility of an objective fluoroscopic measure in assessing pharyngeal strength when manometry may not be available or possible.
