From 1975 through 1988, 257 patients with carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus have been treated in our Department. Operability was 90% (232/257), overall resectability 77% (198/257) and for the operated group 85% (198/232). Hospital mortality was 9.6% but decreased to 3% over the period 1986-1988. There were 65% squamous cell epitheliomas and 35% adenocarcinomas. pTNM staging was as follows: Stage I: 11.6%; Stage II: 23.2%; Stage III: 37.9%; Stage IV: 27.3%. Overall survival was 62.5% at 1 year, 42.4% at 2 year and 30% at 5 year. According to the pTNM staging 5-year survival was 90% for Stage I, 56% for Stage II, 15.3% for Stage III and 0 for Stage IV. There were no statistically significant differences according to tumor localisation, pathologic type, sex, age. Introducing extensive resection and extended lymphadenectomy seems to improve significantly survival in the patients in whom an operation with curative intention was performed, the 1-year survival being 90.8% versus 72%, 2-year survival: 81% versus 46%, and 5-year survival 48.5% versus 41% for respectively radical and non radical resections. Barrett adenocarcinomas have no worse prognosis than other esophageal carcinomas with a 5-year survival of 91.5% if lymphnodes negative, and a 54% overall 5-year survival. Functional results after restoration of continuity with gastric tubulation were judged excellent to very good in 86.5% at 1 year, but infra-aortic anastomoses have a much higher incidence of peptic esophagitis: 53% versus 8% for cervical anastomoses. From this study it can be concluded that in experienced hands surgery today offers the best chances for optimal staging, potential cure, and prolonged high quality palliation.
