 BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus is a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) characterized by specialized columnar epithelium that contains goblet cells and replaces the squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus. It is found in about 10% of patients with symptomatic reflux disease and more importantly has been associated with the development of esophageal cancer. Adenocarcinoma arises from dysplasia, which is usually not visible during routine endoscopy, therefore extensive random sampling of the entire Barrett's segment should be performed with biopsies in the 4 quadrants every 1 to 2 cm and of any macroscopic abnormality. CASE REPORT: We report the history of a 60-year-old man who was admitted to hospital because of an ulcer in Barrett's esophagus not healing despite conservative treatment. He has suffered from gastroesophageal reflux disease for more than 30 years and an antireflux surgical procedure had not resulted in regression of Barrett's esophagus. However, close surveillance could not reveal any dysplastic or malignant lesion. Endoscopic fluorescence detection (EFD) after sensitization with 30 mg/kg 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) in this patient demonstrated a selective red fluorescence in a macroscopically normal appearing area near the already known ulcer. Biopsies from this fluorescent area showed an adenocarcinoma. Esophagectomy confirmed the presence of intramucosal adenocarcinoma without lymph node metastases.
