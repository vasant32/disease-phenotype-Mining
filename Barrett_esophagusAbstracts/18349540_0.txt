 BACKGROUND/AIM: True adenomas of the cardia appear to be extremely rare lesions. There are no data on the natural history and histopathological background of these lesions. We report 3 patients with true adenomas of the cardia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three patients with polypoid masses at the cardia below the Z-line were submitted to a tertiary referral center for further diagnosis and therapy. In 2 of the 3 cases Barrett's esophagus with low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia was assumed on the basis of histopathological examination of biopsy specimens taken from the surface of the lesions. Polypectomy was performed in all 3 cases. In 2 of the 3 cases the final histopathological diagnosis of low-grade adenoma of the cardia could only be established after complete removal of the polypoid masses. CONCLUSIONS: Adenomas of the cardia can be mistaken for dysplasia arising from Barrett's esophagus, if the diagnosis is based on endoscopic biopsies only. It is, therefore, reasonable to completely remove any suspicious lesions by endoscopy not only for therapeutic but also for diagnostic reasons.
