BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common and frequently chronic condition that causes considerable costs. AIM: To estimate the economic burden caused by patients with erosive and non-erosive reflux disease, and Barrett's oesophagus. METHODS: The Progression of Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease study includes a total of 6,215 patients. At baseline, patients were categorized as non-erosive reflux disease, erosive reflux disease, or Barrett's oesophagus according to endoscopic findings alone or as confirmed by histology. Direct and indirect disease-related costs were calculated based on 5,273 patients with complete information in the second year of the study. RESULTS: A total of 73% of the Progression of Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease patients had taken GERD medication, 61% had visited a doctor, and 2% had been hospitalized because of GERD during the previous 12 months. Of all employed persons, 6% reported days off work because of GERD. This health resource utilization caused direct costs of 342+/-864 (mean+/-s.d.) and indirect costs of 40+/-473 per patient and year. Total costs for patients with Barrett's oesophagus or erosive reflux disease were higher than those for patients with non-erosive reflux disease. CONCLUSION: Patients with GERD frequently need long-term medication and doctor care. The disorder is associated with a considerable health economic burden to society.
