Hepatoid adenocarcinoma arising in the esophagus is extremely rare. To date, there are only 3 cases in the world English literature. We report the fourth case here. A 76-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital because of the deterioration of nephritic syndrome. He presented with chest burn, and the endoscopic examination of upper digestive tract disclosed the tumor in the lower esophagus. The subtotal esophagectomy was undertaken because of esophageal cancer. The postoperative histologic examination showed the finding of combined tubular adenocarcinoma and hepatoid adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett esophagus. Immunohistochemically, hepatoid adenocarcinoma cells were positive for a-fetoprotein, hepatocyte, a1-antitrypsin, a1-antichymotrypsin, and CDX2, but negative for MUC5AC and MUC6. Esophageal hepatoid adenocarcinoma seems to be closely associated with Barrett esophagus and show the intestinal phenotype rather than gastric phenotype.
