Thrift et al. provide preliminary evidence that younger age of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease exposure is associated with increased risk of Barrett's esophagus. If these findings are confirmed in other studies, the next logical steps are to test whether this, and other age-specific exposures, can help optimize predictive models of Barrett's esophagus and progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Expansion of these models to the general population and the greater Barrett's esophagus population, respectively, will be required for a screening and surveillance approach to be clinically successful and cost-effective.
