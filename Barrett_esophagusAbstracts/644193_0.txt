The clinical picture of endobrachyesophagus (Barrett's Syndrome) which is little known among radiologists, is described, taking the authors' own observations into account. As soon as the complications leading to clinically manifest complaints occur, consisting of high or centrally positioned peptic stenosis and/or ulceration, diagnosis can be established by means of the usually characteristic findings when a barium sulfate contrast medium is made to pass through the esophagus. Endoscopic-bioptic exploration of the esophagus is mandatory to verify the diagnosis, and, in particular, to exclude any malignant process, the more so since malignant degeneration of cylindrical cell metaplasia, on which endobrachesophagus is based, must be reckoned with in up to 10% of the cases.
