In the recent years, the prevalence of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus has substantially increased. At present its prevalence in the USA is comparable to that of squamous carcinoma (5/100,000 a year). In 80-90% of cases esophageal adenocarcinoma is located in 1/3 of the lower esophagus and is mainly derived from Barrett's esophagus (BE). The role of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection in the pathogenesis of gastritis and gastric ulcer disease has been well known and documented. However, its role in the pathogenesis of esophageal reflux disease, its complications, particularly regarding the risk of Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma is still being studied. The relation between Hp infection and BE has been discussed for many years. The importance of the problem is warranted by the wide prevalence of both Hp infection and reflux disease in the population. The above mentioned findings confirm the protective effects of Hp infection in BE. Despite numerous studies some doubts concerning the relations between Hp infection and BE are still to be explained.
