 UNLABELLED: Endoscopic resection (EMR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) form part of the treatment of Barrett's oesophagus (BO), dysplasia, superficial adenocarcinoma (OAC) associated with BO. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 2008 and April 2011, 34 patients underwent treatment with RFA (HALO system(Â®)), in a tertiary centre. For the study, patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 (16 patients of average 60 years old; 14 men, two women) received EMR and RFA. Group 2 (18 patients averaging 59 years age; 14 men, four women) received RFA without EMR in the year preceding the RFA. RESULTS: In group 1, high grade dysplasia (HGD) was eradicated in 12 cases (92%), low grade dysplasia (LGD) in three cases (100%). Complete response occurred in nine cases (56%), partial response in 100% of cases. Mean follow-up was 15 months. In group 2, HGD was eradicated in one patient (100%), LGD in three patients (64%). A complete response was achieved in eight patients, partial response in four cases (77%). Mean follow-up was 10 months. The complication rate for groups 1 and 2 was of 18% and 10% respectively. No complication prevented completion of treatment or continued monitoring. Recurrence was evaluated to 5% in both groups. CONCLUSION: RFA associated with EMR is feasible, offering probably better results and a very important advantage: a more complete histology before follow-up. Our results show effective treatment of BO and associated dysplasia with a low rate of complication. Nevertheless, when new techniques of BO ablation are used, the need to obtain histology before treatment should not be forgotten.
