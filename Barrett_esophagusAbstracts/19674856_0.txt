During the 20th century, gastro-esophageal reflux moved from the status of a rare and severe disease to that of a frequent disease occurring mostly, in the absence of any significant lesions. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of its therapy and are prescribed mainly in an empirical way. Extradigestive manifestations require more accurate diagnostic tests and therapeutic management. The modalities of prescription of the PPIs quickly progressed toward the on-demand therapy and over-the-counter PPIs should become widespread. The relative failures of PPIs led to a profusion of new antisecretory agents but clinical improvements are presently disappointing and the rationale of this escalation is questionable. The concept of non acid gastro-esophageal reflux opens more innovative diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives which, however, must be validated. In this respect, endoscopic treatment needs more reliable techniques and more rigorous trials. Gastro-esophageal reflux refractory to PPIs corresponds mainly to functional esophageal disorders that need diagnostic and therapeutic improvements. Barrett's esophagus constitutes a major challenge for the next few years. Its screening and its prevention seem, for the moment, inaccessible. Its survey and the prevention of its complications should benefit from progress of diagnostic and interventional endoscopy.
