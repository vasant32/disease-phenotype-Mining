It remains unclear whether surgical treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus (BE) decreases the long-term risk of lower esophagus malignancy; yet, proposed reductions in Barrett's epithelial transformation have been used as a rationale for antireflux surgery. We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with a 40-year history of GERD, whose symptoms returned after a Nissen fundoplication. A gastroscopy done 3 years later revealed BE. Despite close surveillance, adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus was diagnosed 8 years after the original surgery. Thus far, there is insufficient evidence to convince practitioners that surgery should be the first line of treatment to prevent malignant change in BE. Further well-standardized, prospective trials are required. Our case demonstrates that antireflux surgery in a patient with GERD and BE cannot be relied upon to prevent adenocarcinoma.
