There is an increased incidence of malignancies in transplant recipients. Accelerated progression from a premalignant lesion to carcinoma has been reported in transplant recipients with skin cancer and colon cancer. Whereas Barrett's esophagus is a common premalignant condition in the normal population, rapid progression to severe dysplasia or carcinoma has not been widely reported in transplant recipients. We report on a liver transplant recipient who developed rapid progression from Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia within 9 months after transplantation.
