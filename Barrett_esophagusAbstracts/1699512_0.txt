Bioptates obtained from 163 mature persons have been studied, using spiral sections. When the conditions of functioning are altered (at the gastro-esophageal reflux) the organ's integument can destroy, but the defects formed in the lining are covered with a simple cylinder epithelium of the cardial glands. A connection between Barrett's syndrome in the esophagus with its cardial gland is demonstrated. The most widely distributed histological forms of Barrett's esophagus are described.
