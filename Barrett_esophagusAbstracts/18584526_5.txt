 OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of a new ingestion protocol for capsule endoscopy (CE) in evaluating patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). METHODS: Oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy (OGD) was performed 1 week prior to CE. The first 28 subjects swallowed the capsule following the original ingestion protocol (OIP) and the subsequent 30 subjects following a simplified ingestion protocol (SIP). CE videos were reviewed by two independent investigators who were blinded to the OGD findings. RESULTS: Of 48 patients included, 24 were diagnosed with reflux oesophagitis (67% male, mean age 49.5+/-13 years) and 24 with Barrett oesophagus (BO) (88% male, 55.6+/-10 years) by OGD. In addition, 10 asymptomatic healthy controls (50% male, 45.8+/-7.1 years) were included. Oesophageal transit time was faster in patients using the SIP compared to the OIP (126+/-26 s versus 214+/-33; p=0.04). Complete evaluation of the Z-line was possible in 19/28 (68%) of the OIPs compared to 28/30 (93%) of the SIPs (p=0.04). Sensitivity for detecting any oesophageal abnormality was higher in the SIP group than in the OIP group (97% versus 89%; p=0.11). Overall, CE detected oesophagitis in 22/24 patients (sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 88%) and BO in 23/24 patients (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 91%). Furthermore, 41/44 (93%) preferred CE over OGD and experienced less discomfort and pain during CE. CONCLUSION: CE is an accurate method for detecting mucosal oesophageal abnormalities. The new ingestion protocol improves the visualization of the Z-line, which is likely to increase the diagnostic yield of CE.
