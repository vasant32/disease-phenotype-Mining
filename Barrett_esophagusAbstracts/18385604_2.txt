Barrett's esophagus is an acquired condition fundamentally related to the presence of severe and prolonged pathologic acid and biliary gastro-esophageal reflux. However, genetic factors may also play a role in some cases. The aim of this study is to present 3 generations of a Spanish family with the largest number of members so far reported with Barrett's esophagus or esophageal adenocarcinoma. Of the 24 members of this family studied over 3 generations, 6 patients developed esophageal adenocarcinoma, 4 Barrett's esophagus, 6 clinical symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease without Barrett's esophagus, and 8 were asymptomatic. In conclusion, patients with familial Barrett's esophagus get the disease more severely with a high rate of malignancy and, therefore, the endoscopic surveillance should be closer than in cases of nonfamilial Barrett's esophagus.
