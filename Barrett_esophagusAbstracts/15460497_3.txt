BACKGROUND: H. pylori infection is accompanied by a lower prevalence of reflux disease. There is still an ongoing debate as to whether H. pylori actually protects against the development of reflux oesophagitis or is merely an epiphenomenon. A cross-sectional study was performed to study the relation of H. pylori with reflux oesophagitis, hiatus hernia and Barrett's oesophagus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in a period of ten years were studied. Included were patients with active reflux oesophagitis and/or hiatus hernia and/or Barrett's oesophagus. As a reference group, patients without macroscopic abnormalities were included. H. pylori was detected applying routine diagnostic modalities. RESULTS: In the ten years 11,691 consecutive patients were studied. Reflux oesophagitis was seen in 1535 patients, 307 patients had Barrett's oesophagus and a hiatus hernia was present in 2116 patients. The reference group consisted of 5341 patients. H. pylori was significantly less often detected in patients with reflux oesophagitis or Barrett's oesophagus compared with the reference group, 20 vs 29% (p<0.001). Also presence of H. pylori was significantly lower in patients with hiatus hernia 20 vs 29% (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The present study confirms, in a very large group of patients studied in one single centre, the findings of earlier papers. Patients without H. pylori gastritis suffer more often from reflux disease. There is a relation between H. pylori and reflux disease. However, the consequence of this relation will not be the same in every patient.
