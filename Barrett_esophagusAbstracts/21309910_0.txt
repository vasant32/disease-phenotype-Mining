Dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma may arise in patients with Barrett's esophagus after fundoplication esophageal pH monitoring showing no acid in esophagus. This suggests the need to develop methodology to evaluate the occurrence of ultra-distal reflux (1cm above the LES). The objective of the study was to compare acid exposition in three different levels: 5cm above the upper border of the LES, 1cm above the LES and in the intrasphincteric region. Eleven patients with Barrett's esophagus after Nissen fundoplication with no clinical, endoscopic and radiologic evidence of reflux were selected. Four-channel pH monitoring took place: channel A, 5cm above the upper border of the LES; channel B, 1cm above the LES; channel C, intrasphincteric; channel D, intragastric. The results of channels A, B and C were compared. There was significant increase in number of reflux episodes and a higher fraction of time with pH <4.0 in channel B compared to channel A. There was significant decrease in fraction of time with pH <4.0 in channel B compared to channel C. Two cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma were diagnosed in the studied patients. The region 1cm above the upper border of the LES is more exposed to acid than the region 5cm above the upper border of the LES, although this exposure occurred in reduced levels. The region 1cm above the upper border of the LES is less exposed to acid than the intrasphincteric region.
