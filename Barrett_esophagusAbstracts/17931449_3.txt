OBJECTIVES: Patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux uncommonly suffer from conditions associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, in some laryngopharyngeal reflux patients, oesophagitis and Barrett's metaplasia can be diagnosed by oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, it is unclear which patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux would benefit from routine oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of the results of oesophagogastroduodenoscopy in 28 patients with pH-documented laryngopharyngeal reflux. RESULTS: Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy showed oesophagitis in five patients (four with grade A, one with grade B), hiatus hernia in 10 patients (36 per cent), Barrett's metaplasia in two patients, Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis in two patients and gastric mucosal erosions in seven patients (25 per cent). In 13 patients, no abnormalities were detected (46 per cent). Barrett's metaplasia or grade B oesophagitis was diagnosed only in patients with heartburn as their main presenting symptom. CONCLUSIONS: Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy is indicated in at least those laryngopharyngeal reflux patients reporting heartburn as their main complaint.
