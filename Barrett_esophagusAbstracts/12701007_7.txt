BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Specialized columnar epithelium of Barrett's esophagus is a precursor of dysplasia and adenocarcinoma, and methylene blue selectively stains this type of epithelium. The present prospective study examined the detection of short-segment and long-segment Barrett's esophagus using methylene blue chromoendoscopy-directed biopsies, in comparison with biopsies directed using conventional endoscopic criteria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Biopsies were obtained from macroscopically conspicous areas in the distal esophagus observed during conventional endoscopy in a total of 975 patients. Immediately after conventional biopsies, the distal esophagus was sprayed with methylene blue and directed biopsies were then obtained from the stained regions. All patients with a histologically established Barrett's esophagus underwent a second upper gastrointestinal endoscopy within 1 year in order to assess the reproducibility of the method. RESULTS: In a total of 3,900 conventional biopsy specimens (without staining), 54 specimens (1.4%) were found to show Barrett's esophagus and were confined to 16 of the 975 patients (1.6%). Of the total 130 directed biopsy specimens obtained during chromoendoscopy, 114 (87.7%) revealed Barrett's esophagus (P<0.00001) and were confined to 35 of the 975 patients (3.5%; P < or = 0.001). The findings were confirmed within 1 year in all dye-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Chromoendoscopy with methylene blue appears to be an accurate, simple, safe, inexpensive, and reproducible method of detecting specialized columnar epithelium in Barrett's esophagus.
