The diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is established when the esophageal mucosa is lined by 2-3 cm of columnar epithelium or when specialized (intestinal type) columnar epithelium of any length is present. Emphasis is frequently placed on long segments of Barrett's because these patients reportedly are at higher risk of developing adenocarcinoma than patients with shorter segments. We present four cases of adenocarcinoma that arose in tongues or short segments (less than 2 cm) of specialized columnar epithelium near the gastroesophageal junction. We emphasize the need for biopsy of minimal appearing abnormalities in this area, and we suggest that histologic subtype, rather than length of involvement, be the major criterion for establishment of Barrett's esophagus.
