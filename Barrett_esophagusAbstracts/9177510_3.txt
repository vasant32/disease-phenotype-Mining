OBJECTIVE: Barrett's esophagus is currently believed to be related to severe and prolonged pathological acid gastroesophageal reflux. However, other factors have been discussed, especially pancreatic biliary reflux. To determine the importance of pancreatic-biliary reflux in the genesis of Barrett's esophagus, we assessed the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in patients with an intact stomach and in those with previous gastric surgery. METHODS: This is a retrospective study in which 22,236 upper digestive endoscopy reports were reviewed and classified into two groups: intact stomach (n = 21,023) and operated stomach (n = 1,213). In turn, these two groups were divided into five subgroups according to surgical techniques. In each of the groups and subgroups, we calculated the percentage of patients with esophagitis, the percentage of esophagitis patients with Barrett's esophagus, and the percentage of Barrett's esophagus patients with complications. Results were compared by chi2 test. RESULTS: With regard to the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus, we found no significant differences between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that previous gastric surgery does not increase the risk that esophagitis patients will develop Barrett's esophagus.
