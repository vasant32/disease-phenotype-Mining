A retrospective survey identified 96 patients (58 males) with Barrett's esophagus, diagnosed at the Royal Melbourne Hospital between 1978 and 1986. The age at presentation varied from 20 to 93 years, and 43% were greater than 70 years. Heartburn was a presenting symptom in 71%, regurgitation into the pharynx in 54%, dysphagia in 31% and hematemesis or melena in 29%. At endoscopy, the length of Barrett's epithelium ranged from 3 cm to 15 cm. Macroscopic esophagitis was observed in 69%, benign esophageal strictures in 14% and a co-existent adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus in 10% of patients. Only 30% of the patients were cigarette smokers at the time of diagnosis, but 64% drank alcohol (9% greater than 80 g alcohol daily). Patients with esophageal cancer at presentation were more likely to be male and cigarette smokers (Fisher's exact probability test). It has been suggested that patients with Barrett's esophagus should be screened to detect the early development of esophageal cancer. If patients who already have cancer, the elderly (age greater than 70 years) and those with a chronic alcohol problem (greater than 80 g intake daily) are excluded from endoscopic cancer surveillance, only 42% of the patients described in this survey would be eligible for enrollment in such a program. This represents a recruitment of only 5 new patients yearly in a large teaching hospital endoscopy unit.
