 AIM: To investigate the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) throughout the progression of Barretts esophagus (BE). METHODS: COX-2 and EGFR protein expressions were detected by using immunohistochemical method. A detailed cytomorphological changes were determined. Areas of COX-2 and EGFR expression were quantified by using computer Imaging System. RESULTS: The expressions of both COX-2 and EGFR increased along with the progression from BE to esophagus adenocarcinoma (EAC). A positive correlation was found between COX-2 expression and EGFR expression. CONCLUSION: COX-2 and EGFR may be cooperative in the stepwise progression from BE to EAC, thereby leading to carcinogenesis.
