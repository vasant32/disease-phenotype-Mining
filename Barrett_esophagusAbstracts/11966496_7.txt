BACKGROUND: A high level of gastric acid secretion is considered to be a risk factor for reflux oesophagitis or Barrett's oesophagus. Corpus gastritis may have a protective effect on the oesophagus, because of decreased gastric acid output. AIM: To determine if corpus gastritis is associated with reflux oesophagitis or Barrett's oesophagus. METHODS: Three antral and two corpus biopsies were taken from consecutive patients in whom Helicobacter pylori testing was requested during endoscopy at a single centre between January 1995 and May 1997. Antral and corpus gastritis was studied by histology; H. pylori was studied by histology, culture and CLO test. A regression model was used to test for correlation between reflux oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus and risk factors. RESULTS: During the study period, 676 patients had biopsies taken during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Endoscopic signs of reflux oesophagitis and Barrett's oesophagus were observed in 125 and 23 patients, respectively. Corpus gastritis was found in 59% of patients without reflux oesophagitis or Barrett's oesophagus, 45% of patients with reflux oesophagitis and 30% of patients with Barrett's oesophagus. Two hundred and fifty-seven patients underwent follow-up endoscopy after H. pylori therapy. During a mean follow-up of 3 months, the incidence of reflux oesophagitis was not statistically different for patients with healing of corpus gastritis (10/98; 10%) and patients with persistent gastritis (8/97; 8%). CONCLUSIONS: Corpus gastritis was less common in patients with an endoscopic diagnosis of reflux oesophagitis or Barrett's oesophagus.
