Abnormal DNA ploidy status has been suggested as a prognostic factor for Barrett's esophagus progression into esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The aim of the study was to compare image cytometry DNA analysis (ICDA) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in the assessment of DNA ploidy status in Barrett's esophagus (BE), and to determine the value of these abnormalities as an adjunct to conventional cytology in detection of dysplasia and EAC. Brush cytology specimens of 90 BE patients were examined using ICDA and FISH with peri-centromeric probes for chromosomes 7 and 17. The results of ICDA and FISH were compared with each other, and with dysplasia grade or EAC as determined by histology and cytology. FISH and ICDA detected abnormalities in 41% (37/90) and 22% (19/90) of the BE cases, respectively. Gains of chromosome 7 and/or 17 were present in 13% of nondysplasia cases, which further increased with dysplasia stage, while overall DNA content aneuploidy was detected predominantly in high grade dysplasia (HGD) and EAC. Using FISH results combined with cytology, we were able to identify IND/LGD (indefinite/ low grade dysplasia) with a sensitivity and specificity of 75 and 76%, respectively. FISH alone detected HGD/EAC with a high sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 84%, which was superior to that of cytology alone. Thus, FISH is more sensitive than ICDA to detect chromosomal abnormalities in BE brush cytology specimens. FISH detects chromosomal gains in early stages of BE and represents a valuable adjunct to conventional cytology to detect dysplasia or EAC.
