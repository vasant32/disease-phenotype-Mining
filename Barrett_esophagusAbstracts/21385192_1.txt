 BACKGROUND: Barrett's oesophagus is regarded as the most important risk factor for development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. According to current guidelines, treatment should be limited to symptomatic Barrett's oesophagus. AIM: To evaluate the expression of Ki67, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and apoptosis in Barrett's oesophagus after 12 months of double-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy. The effectiveness of esomeprazole and pantoprazole was also compared. METHODS: Seventy-seven nondysplastic Barrett's oesophagus patients underwent baseline upper endoscopy. Patients were then randomised into two groups: one group was allocated to receive esomeprazole 40 mg b.d. and the other group pantoprazole 40 mg b.d. for 12 months. A follow-up endoscopy was performed at the end of treatment. Sixty-five of 77 patients agreed to undergo oesophageal manometry and 24-h pH-metry. Barrett's oesophagus biopsies, obtained at baseline and after treatment, were analysed using immunohistochemistry to assess Ki67 and COX-2 expression; apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL. RESULTS: In the esomeprazole group, a significant decrease in Ki67 and COX-2 expression, as well as an increase in apoptosis, were observed (P < 0.05). By contrast, in the pantoprazole group Ki67, COX-2 and apoptosis did not vary significantly from baseline. By 24-h oesophageal pH-monitoring, a normal acid exposure time was recorded in patients treated with esomeprazole, while those allocated to pantoprazole displayed abnormal acid exposure (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of Barrett's oesophagus patients with high-dose esomeprazole, but not pantoprazole, promoted a decrease in proliferative markers, concomitantly with a decrease in apoptotic cell death. Moreover, esomeprazole allowed a better oesophageal acid control than pantoprazole.
