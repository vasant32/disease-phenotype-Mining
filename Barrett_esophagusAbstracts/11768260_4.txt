The current cost of endoscopically screening patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus (BE) is considerable. A nonendoscopic device that allows for screening of these patients would offer significant cost savings. This pilot study evaluates the utility of cytologically diagnosing BE using a prototype flexible mesh catheter. Patients with known BE undergoing indicated surveillance endoscopy were enrolled in the study. Cytology specimens were obtained using a prototype flexible catheter and were evaluated for the presence of glandular cells, goblet cells, squamous cells, inflammation, and dysplasia. Eleven patients with BE were enrolled in the study. None of the patients experienced complications. Specimens from eight patients (73%) were adequate for evaluation and seven of these patients (87.5%) had goblet cells diagnostic for BE. In conclusion, flexible mesh catheters potentially offer a sensitive, inexpensive, and minimally invasive approach to evaluating patients with GERD and BE.
