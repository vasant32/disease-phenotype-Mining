The molecular genetic mechanisms underlying esophageal cancer are poorly understood. However, a novel gene that may be involved in esophageal carcinogenesis was recently localized by others to distal 17q by linkage analysis of kindreds with palmoplantar keratoderma and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. To help determine whether a distal 17q gene may also be involved in the pathogenesis of primary Barrett's esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas, we performed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of 21 Barrett's and 18 gastric cardia adenocarcinomas at loci spanning 17q: cen-BRCA1-SSTR2-D17S2058-D17S929-D17S722-+ ++D17S937-D17S802-tel. Over 50% of the Barrett's and cardia adenocarcinomas demonstrated loss of an allele at one or more informative distal 17q markers. One common overlapping region of loss involved loci mapped to distal 17q24-proximal 17q25, which tentatively defines a potential chromosomal region distal to BRCA1 involved in the pathogenesis or progression of both types of adenocarcinomas. LOH analysis of DNA from matched microdissected sections of Barrett's metaplasia suggested that loss of D17S2058 in this region may be an early event in the malignant transformation of Barrett's metaplasia. No statistically significant correlations between 17q LOH and tumor stage or patient survival were noted. In summary, LOH mapping of 17q in Barrett's and cardia adenocarcinomas suggests the existence of at least one putative distal 17q tumor suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors.
