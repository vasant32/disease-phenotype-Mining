Morphological research of the esophagogastric transition mucosa at 35 fetuses and newborns was done. The esophagogastric transition was lined by high columnar epithelium and mucos glands. At fetuses of 22-24 week gestational age studied zone didn't have any glands. Histochemical features of the epithelium, particularly MUC5AC positive staining, corresponded to cardial type of the Barrett esophagus, defined at adults. We have revealed that mucosa of the esophagogastric transition has gastric origin and arises before birth. We found out the islets of columnar epithelium on the surface of the laminated pavement epithelium, indicated about its uneven development up to the birth. The sites of immature epithelium could be considered as transformation zones both of laminated pavement epithelium or columnar one.
