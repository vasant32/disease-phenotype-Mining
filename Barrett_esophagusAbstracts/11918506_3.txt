 OBJECTIVE: To estimate the overall healthcare expenditures of patients with Barrett's esophagus in the West Virginia Medicaid population. METHODS: West Virginia Medicaid-paid claims data for the period January 1, 1995, to December 31, 1999, were used for the study. The population included all individuals eligible for West Virginia Medicaid during the study period except for Medicare eligible- and Medicaid managed-care recipients. A prevalence-based approach was used to determine the cost of illness for Barrett's esophagus. RESULTS: The total cost of illness for Barrett's esophagus more than tripled, from $182399 in 1995 to $623864 in 1999, with approximately a 4(1/2)-fold increase in medical and more than a threefold increase in pharmacy costs. The average cost of treating Barrett's esophagus was found to be approximately $1207 per patient in 1999. Overall, pharmacy costs accounted for >66% of the total costs. Controlling for age, gender, and number of comorbidities, patients with Barrett's esophagus incur 21.2% higher overall costs than patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and 62.4% higher overall costs than the general Medicaid population. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing prevalence of and resource utilization for Barrett's esophagus provide a framework for further analysis and implementation of policies aimed at appropriate allocation of resources for the state's Medicaid program.
