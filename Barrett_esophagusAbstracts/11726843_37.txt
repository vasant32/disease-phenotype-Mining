BACKGROUND: Nonoperative therapy with intent to cure may be considered for patients with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma. However, a more advanced stage of disease must be precluded before such treatment. The potential of EUS for this purpose was evaluated. METHODS: EUS was performed in patients with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma based on endoscopy, endoscopic biopsies, and CT before esophagectomy. EUS findings were compared with surgical/pathologic evaluation. RESULTS: EUS suggested submucosal invasion in 6 patients and lymph node involvement in 5 patients. By surgical/pathologic evaluation, 5 of 22 patients (23%) had unsuspected submucosal invasion and 1 had lymph node involvement. EUS detected all 5 instances of submucosal invasion and the single instance of lymph node involvement. EUS was falsely positive for submucosal invasion in 1 patient and for lymph node involvement in 4 patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values of preoperative EUS for submucosal invasion were 100%, 94%, and 100%, and for lymph node involvement were 100%, 81%, and 100%, respectively. A nodule or stricture noted by endoscopy was associated with an increased likelihood of submucosal invasion. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma, EUS detected otherwise unsuspected submucosal invasion and lymph node involvement. Patients should be evaluated with EUS when nonoperative therapy is contemplated.
