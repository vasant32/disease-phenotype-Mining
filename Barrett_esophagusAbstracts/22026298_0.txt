Laparoscopic antireflux surgery is very successful in patients with short-segment Barrett's esophagus (BE), but in patients with long-segment BE, the results remain in discussion. In these patients, during the open era of surgery, we performed acid suppression + duodenal diversion procedures added to the antireflux procedure (fundoplication + vagotomy + antrectomy + Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy) to obtain better results at long-term follow-up. The aim of this prospective study is to present the results of 3 to 5 years' follow-up in patients with short-segment and long-segment or complicated BE (ulcer or stricture) who underwent fundoplication or the acid suppression-duodenal diversion technique, both performed by a laparoscopic approach. One hundred eight patients with histologically confirmed BE were included: 58 patients with short-segment BE, and 50 with long-segment BE, 28 of whom had complications associated with severe erosive esophagitis, ulcer, or stricture. After surgery, among patients treated with fundoplication with cardia calibration, endoscopic erosive esophagitis was observed in 6.9% of patients with short-segment BE, while 50% of patients with long-segment BE presented with positive acid reflux, persistence of endoscopic esophagitis with intestinal metaplasia, and progression to dysplasia (in 5% of cases; P = 0.000). On the contrary, after acid suppression-duodenal diversion surgery in patients with long-segment BE, more than 95.6% presented with successful results regarding recurrent symptoms and endoscopic regression of esophagitis. Regression of intestinal metaplasia to the cardiac mucosa was observed in 56.9% of patients with short-segment BE who underwent fundoplication and in 61% of those with long-segment BE treated with the acid suppression-duodenal diversion procedure. Patients with long-segment BE who experienced fundoplication alone presented no regression of intestinal metaplasia; on the contrary, progression to dysplasia was observed in 1 case (P = 0.049). Patients with short-segment BE can be successfully treated with fundoplication, but for patients with long-segment BE, we suggest performance of fundoplication plus an acid suppression-duodenal diversion procedure.
