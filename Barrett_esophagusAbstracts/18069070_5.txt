 BACKGROUND: To assess the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) at a tertiary referral Center of Excellence for bariatric surgery on the length and presence of dysplasia in morbidly obese patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). Esophageal reflux of gastroduodenal contents (acid, bile) contributes to the development of BE and progression in the dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. Obese patients have a high prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux and might be at an increased risk of developing BE and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The effect of eliminating duodenogastroesophageal reflux on BE is not known. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with pre-existing, biopsy-proven, long-segment (>3 cm) BE undergoing RYGB at our institution. Only patients with >1 year of endoscopic, biopsy-controlled follow-up (mean 34 mo) were included. RESULTS: Five patients (3 men and 2 women) were identified. The mean +/- standard error of the mean preoperative length of BE was 6 +/- 2 cm; 2 patients had low-grade dysplasia and 1 indeterminate dysplasia. At the postoperative follow-up (>1 yr) examinations, the length of BE had decreased in 4 patients; the overall length was 2 +/- 1 cm; and only 1 patient had dysplasia. All patients experienced a decrease in the length of BE (n = 4), complete disappearance of BE (n = 2), or improvement in the degree of dysplasia (n = 3). The body mass index had decreased from 43 +/- 4 kg/m(2) to 33 +/- 3 kg/m(2), and all experienced subjective improvement in reflux symptoms postoperatively. RYGB resulted in complete or partial regression of BE in 4 of 5 patients and improvement in reflux symptoms in all. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that RYGB might be the procedure of choice in morbidly obese patients with BE requiring surgical treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
