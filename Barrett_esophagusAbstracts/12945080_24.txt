BACKGROUND: Patients with an intrathoracic oesophagogastrostomy after subtotal oesophagectomy experience profound duodenogastro-oesophageal reflux (DGOR). This study investigated the degree of mucosal injury and histopathological changes in oesophageal squamous epithelium after subtotal oesophagectomy with gastric interposition in relation to the extent of postoperative DGOR. METHODS: Serial endoscopic assessment and systematic biopsy at the oesophagogastric anastomosis was undertaken in 40 patients following curative radical subtotal oesophagectomy and reconstruction with a gastric conduit subjected to a pyloroplasty. Thirty patients subsequently underwent combined 24-h ambulatory pH and bilirubin monitoring. RESULTS: Grade I-III oesophagitis was identified in 14 patients and oesophageal columnar epithelium in 19 patients. Biopsies from columnar regeneration revealed cardiac-type epithelium in ten patients and intestinal metaplasia in nine. Seven patients followed serially showed progression from cardiac-type epithelium to intestinal metaplasia. The incidence of Barrett's metaplasia was similar irrespective of the histological subtype of the resected tumour. Patients with oesophageal columnar epithelium had significantly higher acid (P = 0.015) and bilirubin (P = 0.011) reflux. CONCLUSION: Severe DGOR occurs following subtotal oesophagectomy and provides an environment for the acquisition of Barrett's metaplasia via a sequence of cardiac epithelium and eventual intestinal metaplasia.
