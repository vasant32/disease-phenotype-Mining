The upper-gastrointestinal examinations of 32 patients (mean age, 11 years) with histologically proven Barrett's esophagus were reviewed to evaluate the radiologic findings in children. All patients had symptoms of chronic gastroesophageal reflux and/or esophagitis, including atypical findings such as aspiration pneumonia, seizures, and failure to thrive. Fourteen patients had other diseases that might predispose them to abnormal esophageal motility and gastroesophageal reflux. Twenty-five patients had single-contrast and seven patients had double-contrast examinations. Four patients had normal single-contrast studies; 24 had gastroesophageal reflux; 12 had strictures; 10 had esophageal ulcers; and only four had hiatal hernias. The most notable difference between the results of endoscopy and the upper-gastrointestinal studies was the rate of detection of esophageal ulcers. Ten of the patients with single-contrast studies had ulcers seen at endoscopy but not shown radiologically. No specific radiologic signs of Barrett's esophagus were found, although most of our patients had abnormal upper gastrointestinal studies.
