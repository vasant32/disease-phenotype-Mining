To investigate on the presence and significance of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) in Barrett's mucosa, esophageal biopsy specimens from 34 patients with columnar-lined epithelium were retrospectively examined. The incidence of colonization was compared with that observed in a control group of 76 subjects with normal esophageal mucosa or moderate esophagitis. Three of the 34 Barrett's specimens were Hp-positive and only 1 of these showed evidence of inflamed mucosa (p = NS). We do not find in this study any evidence to support the existence of association between Hp and Barrett's esophagus or esophageal inflammation. The presence of Hp in antral mucosa of all positive cases suggest the possibility that esophageal colonisation might merely be a consequence of reflux from the gastric antrum.
