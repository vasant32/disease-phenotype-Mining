 BACKGROUND: Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), a transmembrane glycoprotein, seems to play a key role in the adaption of tumor cells to hypoxia. This study was designed to investigate the clinical role of CAIX and its association with Her-2 in a large cohort of adeno- (AC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the esophagus and their metastases. METHODS: Expression of CAIX and Her-2 was investigated immunohistochemically in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 330 esophageal cancers (182 ACS, 148 SCCs). Corresponding lymph node metastases in 137 cases, distant metastases in 34 cases, and local recurrences in 14 cases were analyzed for CAIX expression. RESULTS: A total of 147 cases (44.5%) showed strong CAIX expression (AC: 46.7%; ACC: 41.9%). CAIX status of the primary tumor influenced CAIX expression in corresponding lymph node metastases (P<0.001, linear regression). High CAIX-expression was an independent prognostic factor for shorter overall and disease-free survival (Pâ‰¤0.05, Cox regression). Twenty-nine ACs (15.9%) and 6 SCCs (4.1%) showed Her-2 overexpression. In AC, a significant positive correlation between the Her-2 status and CAIX expression was found (P=0.009, chi-square test). CONCLUSIONS: High CAIX expression is associated with shorter survival in esophageal cancer, and the hypoxic phenotype seems to be preserved at least during formation of lymph node metastases. Inhibition of CAIX might reduce the ability of tumor cells to establish disseminated disease. In Her-2 overexpressing ACs, blocking of this tyrosine kinase, e.g., by monoclonal antibodies, might induce this effect.
