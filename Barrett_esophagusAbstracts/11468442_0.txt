We report a case of Barrett's adenocarcinoma of the esophagus with lymphoid stroma. We believe this is the first reported case of this entity, although six previous cases of esophageal lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma have been reported. The esophageal tumor from a 58-year-old man was examined histologically. In situ hybridization to detect Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was also performed. The tumor consisted of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with dense lymphoid cell infiltration in the invasive portions and a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma without lymphoid stroma in the mucosa. Barrett's epithelium was observed adjacent to the carcinoma. No positive signals for EBV were detected in the tumor cells. Six previously reported patients with esophageal lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas, and the current patient, all survived for longer than 24 months, a better outcome than that of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinomas of usual type. The data suggest that this tumor arose as a mucosal, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma without lymphoid stroma and that EBV had no relation to either its pathogenesis or progression.
