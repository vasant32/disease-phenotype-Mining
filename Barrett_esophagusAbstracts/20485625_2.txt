Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a frequent complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease, an acquired condition resulting from persistent mucosal injury to the esophagus. The incidence of Barrett's metaplasia and Barrett's adenocarcinoma has been increasing, but the prognosis of Barrett's adenocarcinoma is worse because individuals present at a late stage. Attempts have been made to intervene at early stage using surveillance programmes, although proof of efficacy of endoscopic surveillance is lacking. There is much to be learned about BE. Whether adequate control of gastroesophageal reflux early in the disease alters the natural history of Barrett's change once it has developed remains unanswered. Thus there is great need for carefully designed large randomised controlled trials to address these issues in order to determine how best to manage patients with BE. The AspECT and BOSS clinical trials proride this basis.
