 BACKGROUND/AIMS: In contrast to Western countries where erosive esophagitis (EE) is more prevalent in males, there is a high incidence of EE in elderly females in Japan. We aimed to examine the gender differences in the age-stratified prevalence of EE and Barrett's epithelium. METHODOLOGY: The study population comprised 869 cases (463 men and 406 women) who had undergone an upper endoscopy at the Gastroenterology Division of Yokohama City University Hospital between August 2005 and July 2006. EE was graded according to the Los Angeles Classification. Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed based on the Prague C & M Criteria. RESULTS: In contrast to the decrease of the proportion of EE with aging in males, that in females remained constant. The results suggest that the suppressive effect of the increased gastric mucosal atrophy associated with aging was wiped out by the age-related effect of the increased incidence of hiatal hernia. The proportions of Barrett's epithelium in both males and females increased with aging. CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, the prevalence of elderly females complicated with hiatal hernia, which was partly due to osteoporosis and kyphosis, may affect the proportion of EE and probably Barrett's epithelium.
