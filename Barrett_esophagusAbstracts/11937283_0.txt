Barrett's esophagus is associated with increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junctional region. The presence of goblet cells (intestinal metaplasia) in columnar cell-lined esophageal mucosa defines Barrett's change. The diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is based on the presence of intestinal metaplasia in a biopsy from an endoscopically visualized abnormal columnar epithelium. In this pilot study, acoustic microscopy was used to identify the mucosal structure of 10 distal esophageal biopsies. Sections cut at 5 microm of archival paraffin blocks on glass slides were used for this study. Acoustic microscopy permitted the identification of low- and high-power images of epithelial architecture and cellular detail, including Barrett's epithelium. This modality of visualization has the potential to detect lesions such as Barrett's metaplasia, low- and high-grade dysplasia and early carcinoma. If it can be applied to in vivo endoscopy, acoustic microscopy has the potential to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus, dysplasia and malignancy by providing a method of accurately directing biopsies at endoscopy.
