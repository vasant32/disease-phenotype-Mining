Review of 34 cases of pathologically proved Barrett-type adenocarcinoma of the esophagus seen at the University of Michigan during 1962-1983 revealed that it constituted 5% of all carcinomas of the esophagus and 20% of all adenocarcinomas involving the esophagus during that period. Despite many similarities to conventional squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cardiac carcinoma, certain distinguishing features were identified. Radiologically, diagnosis of Barrett carcinoma should be suggested when a patient with a longstanding history of gastroesophageal reflux, chronic esophagitis, and hiatus hernia with or without features of Barrett esophagus demonstrates a long vertical segment of esophageal involvement by an infiltrating or varicoid-appearing lesion. This review analyzes the clinical and radiologic distinguishing features of Barrett carcinoma and compares those of gastric cardiac carcinoma and conventional squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
