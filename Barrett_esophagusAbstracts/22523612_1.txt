In the last few decades, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has become the most complementary test for investigation of esophageal diseases. Its accessibility and safety guarantee wide clinical utilization in patients with suspected benign and malignant diseases of the esophagus. Recent technological advances in endoscopic imaging and tissue analysis obtained from the esophagus have been useful to better understand and manage highly relevant diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic esophagitis and esophageal cancer. Using endoscopy to elucidate esophageal disorders in children has been another field of intensive and challenging research. This editorial highlights the latest advances in the endoscopic management of esophageal diseases, and focuses on Barrett's esophagus, esophageal cancer, eosinophilic esophagitis, as well as esophageal disorders in the pediatric population.
