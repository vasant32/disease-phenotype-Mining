PURPOSE: The most common marker of oxidative DNA damage is 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), which is linked with several malignancies. In the present study we investigated whether DNA damage linked to oxidative stress (as 8-OHdG) is present in Barrett's mucosa with or without associated adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia and in normal controls' squamous mucosa. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We measured 8-OHdG in 51 patients (13 Barrett's metaplasia, six Barrett's oesophagus with high-grade dysplasia, 18 adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus/oesophagogastric junction and 14 normal controls). The amount of DNA damage was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in oesophagus samples obtained either from endoscopy or as samples from surgery. The median 8-OHdG concentration was expressed as the ratio of 8-OHdG per 10(5) deoxyguanosine. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that 8-OHdG was present in both Barrett's metaplasia with and without dysplasia as well as in adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus/oesophagogastric junction. Although the study group was small the amount of 8-OHdG was significantly increased in the distal oesophagus both in Barrett's epithelium 1.26 (0.08-29.47) and in high-grade dysplasia 1.35 (1.04-1.65) as well as in adenocarcinoma of oesophagus/oesophagogastric junction 1.08 (0.59-1.94) compared to controls 0.06 (0-4.08) (p=0.002, p=0.012, p=0.001, respectively). Barrett's patients had no significant difference in 8-OHdG levels between their distal and proximal oesophageal samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the presence of oxidative DNA damage in the distal oesophagus of patients with Barrett's oesophagus and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus/oesophagogastric junction. This may have a connection to carcinogenesis in Barrett's oesophagus.
