The authors evaluated the prevalence of colonize by Helicobacter Pylori in 21 adults patients with Barrett's esophagus; 12 males and 9 females; with ranges of age from 21 to 81 years and a medium of 56.4 years old. It was detected in 23.8% that Helicobacter Pylori was positive in Barrett's esophagus, being quite higher, 26.6% in patients over 50 years old. In the five cases with positive Helicobacter Pylori, the Barrett esophagus presented a fundic gastric mucosa and no one intestinal metaplasia. Helicobacter Pylori was not seen in esophageal biopsies from patients with reflux esophagitis without Barrett's esophagus. The clinical value of the Helicobacter Pylori finding in Barrett's esophagus and its importance of the following at long term must be explained and studied in the future, by the evaluation in numerous patients groups and prolonged follow-up.
