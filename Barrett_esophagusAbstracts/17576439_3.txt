Since the early 1970s, a dramatic change has occurred in the epidemiology of esophageal malignancy in both North America and Europe: the incidence of adenocarcinomas of the lower esophagus and esophagogastric junction is increasing. Several lifestyle factors are implicated in this change, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Primary esophageal adenocarcinomas are thought to arise from Barrett esophagus, an acquired condition in which the normal esophageal squamous epithelium is replaced by a specialized metaplastic columnar-cell-lined epithelium.Today, gerd is recognized as an important risk factor in Barrett esophagus. Progression of Barrett esophagus to invasive adenocarcinoma is reflected histologically by the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. Although several molecular alterations associated with progression of Barrett esophagus to invasive adenocarcinoma have been identified, relatively few will ultimately have clinical application. Currently, the histologic finding of high-grade dysplasia remains the most reliable predictor of progression to invasive esophageal adenocarcinoma. However other promising molecular biomarkers include aneuploidy; 17p loss of heterozygosity, which implicates the TP53 tumour suppressor gene; cyclin D1 protein overexpression; and p16 alterations. It is anticipated that models incorporating combinations of objective scores of sociodemographic and lifestyle risk factors (that is, age, sex, body mass index), severity of gerd, endoscopic and histologic findings, and a panel of biomarkers will be developed to better identify patients with Barrett esophagus at increased risk for malignant progression, leading to more rational endoscopic surveillance and screening programs.
