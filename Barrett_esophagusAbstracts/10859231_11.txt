Barrett's esophagus (BE) results from acid and bile reflux and predisposes to cancer. We investigated the effect of bile salts, with or without acid, on cell proliferation in BE and assessed mechanism(s) involved. To mimic physiological conditions, biopsies of esophagus, BE, and duodenum were exposed to a bile salt mixture, either continuously or as a 1-h pulse, and were compared with control media without bile salts (pH 7.4) for < or =24 h. Similar experiments were also performed with acidified media (pH 3.5) combined with the bile salt mixture as a 1-h pulse. Cell proliferation was assessed by a [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay with or without bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), a selective protein kinase C inhibitor. Bile salt pulses enhanced cell proliferation in BE without affecting cell proliferation in esophageal or duodenal epithelia. In the presence of BIM, there was complete obliteration of the bile salt-induced BE hyperproliferation. In contrast, 1-h pulses of bile salts in combination with acid significantly inhibited proliferation in BE but had no effect on esophagus or duodenum. We conclude that in BE explants, brief exposure to bile salts, in the absence of acid, increases proliferation, whereas exposure to a combination of bile salts and acid together inhibits proliferation.
