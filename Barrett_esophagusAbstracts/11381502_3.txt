This retrospective review aimed to assess the clinical profile and outcome of squamous cell carcinoma as compared with adenocarcinoma of the lower third of esophagus and cardia following a transhiatal esophagectomy. A total of 169 patients were analyzed retrospectively in this series from 1989 to 1994. There were 100 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 69 patients with adenocarcinoma (ADC). All tumors were assessed by an esophagogram, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and abdominal ultrasonography. The surgical procedure performed in all cases was a transhiatal esophagectomy (THE). The mean age of the patients with SCC and ADC was comparable (48 +/- 14 vs 54 +/- 12 years). Male/female ratio was 1.0:1.4 in the SCC group while in the ADC group it was 8.8:1.0. The main symptom in both the groups was grade II dysphagia (62% in SCC and 60% in ADC). The mean length of the tumor was 6.6 +/- 4.5 cm in the SCC group and 4.2 +/- 3.3 cm in the ADC group. The resectability rate of the SCC group was significantly higher (76%) than in the ADC group (55%). The 6-month and 1-year survival for the SCC patients was not significantly different from the ADC patients (83.7% and 49.3% vs 85.0% and 54.0%). The 5-year survival achieved in SCC was higher than in the ADC group (11.6% vs 7.2%) but the difference was not statistically significant. Adenocarcinoma arising from the distal esophagus and cardia was more common in males, and also occurred in a higher age group and had a lower resectability rate than squamous cell carcinoma. No case of Barrett's esophagus was encountered. The short- and long-term survival in both tumors were similar.
