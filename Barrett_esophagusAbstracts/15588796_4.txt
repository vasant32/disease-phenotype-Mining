In the early 1900's, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was an almost unknown entity with less than 200 cases reported worldwide. Currently the disease is regarded as almost endemic with as much as 25% of the population in some countries exhibiting signs or symptoms of reflux. Early therapies directed at chemical neutralization (milk drip, antacids) were of modest effect and required constant administration for efficacy. The introduction of histamine 2 receptor antagonists in the 1970's dramatically improved the management of GERD, but was limited by problems of tachyphylaxis and adverse events. The advent of the PPI class of drugs revolutionized medical care of GERD, given their efficacy and safety profile. As a consequence, the surgical approach with its pronounced dependence on individual operator skill and its high morbidity and even mortality has fallen into disregard. Thus, modest surgical outcome results as compared to the efficacy of PPIs has led to the widespread recognition that pharmacological therapy for GERD represents the platinum standard of care and the current consensus is that the PPI class of drugs provide the safest and most effective form of therapy for GERD. Furthermore, it is apparent based on acid suppression, symptom relief and healing rates, that all PPIs are on a milligram for milligram basis similarly efficacious for the management of GERD. While a consensus exists in regard to the current management of GERD with PPIs there is little agreement as to the management of the associated mucosal metaplastic process. At this time there is inadequate understanding of the biological basis of the mucosal transformation and minimal information about the mechanistic regulation of this event and its perpetuation. A future consensus thus requires the identification of the appropriate tools to detect Barrett's early, identify the specific molecular markers associated with neoplastic transformation and establish a definitive therapeutic algorithm.
