Radionuclide esophageal scintigraphy is a sensitive test of esophageal function, but its usefulness is not well documented in Barrett esophagus. This technique was prospectively studied in 27 patients with histologically proved Barrett esophagus and 17 patients with biopsy-confirmed reflux esophagitis. The esophageal transit time and percentage of emptying were calculated. The only quantitative parameter of radionuclide esophageal scintigraphy to show a significant difference between the two conditions was the percentage of emptying, which was abnormal in 48% of patients with Barrett esophagus versus 31% of patients with reflux esophagitis. In the latter group, the mean percentage of emptying approached normal (89.5%), while in the former group it was decreased to 82.1% (P less than .05). Neither emptying parameter correlated with length of Barrett esophagus. These data support the hypothesis of inherent esophageal dysmotility in Barrett esophagus. Half of the patients with this condition have impaired esophageal clearance and may benefit from drug therapy.
