Heller's myotomy for esophageal achalasia was performed on 64 patients in the 24 yr up to 1988. After follow-up averaging 13 yr, 46 patients were reexamined with endoscopy, biopsy, and manometry. Barrett's metaplasia of the distal esophagus was found in four patients 6, 13, 20, and 23 yr after the myotomy. These four also underwent ambulatory 24-h pH monitoring. They had the lowest distal esophageal sphincter pressures (1-5 mm Hg), and all four had symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux and pathologic pH values (< 4 in the distal esophagus for 32-62% of the total recording time). Because of heightened risk for the development of Barrett's metaplasia following cardiomyotomy for esophageal achalasia, with increased liability to carcinoma of the esophagus, regular endoscopic surveillance of these patients is advisable.
