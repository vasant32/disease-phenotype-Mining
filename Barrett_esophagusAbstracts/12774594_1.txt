Management of columnar lined oesophagus (CLO; Barrett s oesophagus) is controversial. We prospectively audited surveillance practices in Scotland and prospectively assessed the impact of introducing local guidelines for Barrett s surveillance in Edinburgh. Most respondents were gastroenterologists. The majority take random, not four quadrant, biopsies from the CLO. In Edinburgh during 2000, 80 patients underwent surveillance. The guideline protocol was not followed in 30 (37.5%) patients. Follow up of patients without dysplasia generally conformed to the guidelines. Follow up of patients with low grade dysplasia was highly variable while management of those with high grade dysplasia followed the guidelines. Overall we found a wide variability in the management and surveillance of CLO. Early experience suggests that implementation of guidelines is helpful but there is still variation in practice.
