Optimal therapy for early carcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction remains uncertain. Treatment alternatives discussed today reach from endoluminal techniques to radical esophagectomy with 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy. In this context, the Merendino procedure with preservation of the vagal innervation to the stomach appears as an interesting therapeutic alternative. This paper summarizes indications, operative technique, and functional results with respect to postoperative quality of life in view of 2 cases operated in our department.
