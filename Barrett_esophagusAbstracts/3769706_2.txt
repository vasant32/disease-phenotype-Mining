Delayed gastric emptying as a pathophysiologic factor in patients with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is controversial. In order to further evaluate this question, we studied a population with severe reflux, specifically, patients with Barrett's esophagus. Solid-phase gastric emptying was measured in 17 patients and in 17 healthy volunteers using radionuclide imaging. Gastric emptying was variable among these patients with 70% normal, 18% rapid, and only 12% slow studies. From these observations, we conclude that delayed gastric emptying is unlikely to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus.
