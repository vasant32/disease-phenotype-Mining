 OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical, pathological features of severe reflux esophagitis (SRE) and Barrett's esophagus (BE) and search for expression and significance of Ki-67 and COX-2 in their tissues. METHODS: Both SRE (n = 15) and BE (n = 25) cases were retrospectively analyzed for clinical manifestations, endoscopic findings and pathological features. The expression levels of Ki-67 and COX-2 of esophageal epithelium in the two groups were compared with that of normal esophageal (NE) epithelium (n = 10) by immunoperoxidase staining. RESULTS: It was found that the positivity and staining intensity of Ki-67 expression in SRE and BE were higher than those in normal esophageal epithelium (P<0.01), but there were no statistical differences between these two groups (P>0.05); COX-2 was selectively expressed in some BE epithelium, but not in SRE and normal esophageal epithelium. CONCLUSION: There were intensified Ki-67 expressions in the epithelium of SRE and BE, which could help us to evaluate the prognosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients clinically by surveillance of Ki-67. COX-2 was selectively expressed in BE epithelium, so COX-2 inhibitors may have the potential for treatment of BE and for chemoprevention of its malignant change.
