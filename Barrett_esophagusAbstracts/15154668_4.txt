 BACKGROUND: The risk of presenting with oesophageal cancer is associated with Barrett's oesophagus, with a higher prevalence in some Asian and African countries. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA has been identified in oesophageal carcinomas, which share common features with cervical cancers and originate in stratified epithelium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight paraffin-embedded tissue biopsies were selected from Mexican patients: 17 from oesophageal cancers, 28 from cases of Barrett's oesophagus and 23 from cases of oesophagitis. HPV protein was detected immunohistochemically and the presence and types of HPV DNA were assessed by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: HPV DNA-positive results were found in 26% of samples of oesophagitis, 96% of samples of Barrett's oesophagus and 88% of samples of oesophageal cancers. HPV viral types 6 and 11 were prevalent. HPV protein was detected in 41 samples (60%). CONCLUSION: Mexico has a high prevalence of HPV in premalignant and malignant oesophageal diseases compared with other countries.
