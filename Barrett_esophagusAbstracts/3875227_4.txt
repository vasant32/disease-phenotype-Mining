Twenty-nine cases of Barrett esophagus verified by endoscopy and 16 cases confirmed by histology were reviewed for pertinent radiologic signs. All patients had barium-filled and mucosal relief films, and all but five cases had double-contrast films. Common radiologic signs in descending order were thickened and irregular mucosal folds (28/29), hiatal hernia (26/29), esophageal stricture (25/29), esophageal ulcer (20/29), distal esophageal widening (19/29), granular mucosal pattern (16/24), reticular mucosal pattern (9/24), and intramural pseudodiverticula (6/29), all of which are also recognized signs of reflux esophagitis. Midesophageal stricture, esophageal ulcer, and distal esophageal widening were particularly indicative of Barrett esophagus. Since there appears to be no specific sign of Barrett esophagus, a multifaceted approach is suggested concentrating on the association of Barrett esophagus with the radiographic signs of severe reflux esophagitis.
