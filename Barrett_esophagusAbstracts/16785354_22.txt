 HYPOTHESIS: The reported morbidity and mortality associated with esophagectomy for high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and intramucosal cancer (IMC) have led asymptomatic patients to consider less invasive and possibly less effective treatments. This study provides a critical assessment of outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQL) after esophagectomy for HGD and IMC. DESIGN: Cohort analytic study. SETTING: Section of thoracic surgery at a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: All patients who presented between May 1991 and February 2003 with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of Barrett esophagus with HGD or IMC were assessed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prospective analysis of postoperative morbidity, mortality, HRQL, and gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: Follow-up was complete in 36 patients. Mean follow-up was 4.9 years (range, 0.5-12.0 years). The incidence of postoperative invasive cancer was 39%, with stages ranging from I to IIB. There were 4 major complications (11%) and no operative mortality. Twenty-eight patients were alive, with a cancer-free survival of 85%. The HRQL outcomes (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) were comparable with those of age- and sex-matched controls. Significant differences in postesophagectomy gastrointestinal symptoms were seen with a decreased incidence of heartburn (P < or = .001) and increased requirement for a slower speed of eating. Twenty-two (79%) of the 28 patients described their current eating pattern as "normal or insignificantly impacted." CONCLUSIONS: Esophagectomy for HGD and IMC can be accomplished with low morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, most patients are able to resume a normal eating pattern, and postoperative HRQL can be equivalent to that of the general population.
