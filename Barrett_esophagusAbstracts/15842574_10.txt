 OBJECTIVE: Patients who undergo esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction incur increased risk for acid reflux and duodenogastroesophageal reflux. Few postesophagectomy studies of gastroesophageal reflux disease have included simultaneous 24-h pH and bilirubin monitoring. The aim of this study is to evaluate acid reflux and duodenogastroesophageal reflux after esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction. METHODS: Reflux symptom evaluation, endoscopy, and simultaneous 24-h pH and bilirubin monitoring in the cervical esophagus were performed in 25 patients who underwent Ivor Lewis esophagectomy, intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy, and digital dilation of the pyloric ring as treatment for esophageal cancer. RESULTS: Reflux symptoms were severe, mild, and absent in 2, 7, and 16 patients, respectively. Reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus was observed in 11 and 1 patients, respectively. Elevated acid reflux occurred in 7 patients (28%). Elevated duodenogastroesophageal reflux was recorded in 11 patients (44%). Reflux profile analysis identified three patterns: 4 subjects (16%) with both elevated acid reflux and duodenogastroesophageal reflux; 3 (12%) with only elevated acid reflux; and 7 (28%) with only elevated duodenogastroesophageal reflux. Of 7 patients with only elevated duodenogastroesophageal reflux, 4 developed reflux esophagitis. Although reflux symptoms did not correlate with endoscopic esophagitis, a significant correlation was observed between endoscopic esophagitis and acid reflux and/or duodenogastroesophageal reflux. CONCLUSIONS: Reflux symptoms represented a poor indication of esophagitis in patients with esophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction. Simultaneous 24-h pH and bilirubin monitoring can help in identifying patients at high risk for reflux esophagitis, as well as indicating the cause of esophagitis.
