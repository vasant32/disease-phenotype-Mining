BACKGROUND: Apoptosis maintains cell homeostasis. Altered apoptosis is involved in carcinogenesis. It was our aim to investigate whether reflux esophagitis may alter apoptosis in the esophageal mucosa and whether antireflux surgery may restore normal apoptosis. METHODS: Apoptosis was studied preoperatively and postoperatively in esophageal biopsies of 39 patients with various grades of reflux esophagitis and in Barrett's mucosa using the TUNEL method. Biopsies were also taken from lesions of the squamous epithelium adjacent to the Barrett's mucosa. RESULTS: Apoptosis increased with the severity of esophagitis. Apoptosis was low in Barrett's epithelium. Squamous epithelium adjacent to Barrett's mucosa showed increased apoptosis. After surgery apoptosis decreased in squamous epithelium, and it remained low in Barrett's epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis in reflux esophagitis may be protective against increased proliferation. Low apoptosis following antireflux surgery indicates that surgery is effective to prevent reflux-induced cell proliferation. Inhibition of apoptosis in Barrett's may promote carcinogenesis. This may not change following surgery.
