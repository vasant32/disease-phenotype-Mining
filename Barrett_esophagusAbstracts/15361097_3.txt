There are many reports concerning the surgical treatment of patients with Barrett's esophagus, but very few focus on histological changes of inflammatory cells in squamous and columnar epithelium before and late after classic antireflux or acid suppression-duodenal diversion surgery. We evaluate the impact of these procedures in the presence of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and Helicobacter pylori in the columnar epithelium. Two groups of patients were studied, 37 subjected to classic antireflux and 96 to acid suppression-duodenal diversion operations. They were subjected to endoscopic and histological studies before and at 1, 3 and more than 5 years after surgery. Manometric evaluations and 24 h pH monitoring were performed before and at 1 year after surgery. The presence of inflammatory cells at both the squamous and columnar epithelium was significantly higher at the late follow up in patients subjected to classic antireflux surgery compared with patients subjected to acid suppression-duodenal diversion operations (P < 0.02 and P < 0.001, respectively). Intestinal metaplasia, present in 100% of patients before surgery, had decreased significantly at 3 years after surgery in patients subjected to acid suppression-duodenal diversion operations compared with classic antireflux procedures, 75% versus 53%, respectively (P < 0.001). The presence of Helicobacter pylori did not vary before or after surgery in either group. In conclusion, acid suppression-duodenal diversion operations are followed by a decreased presence of inflammatory cells in both squamous and columnar epithelium compared with classic antireflux surgery in patients with Barrett's esophagus. Intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia and inflammation findings were also less common after acid suppression-duodenal diversion operation.
