During the 5-year period from 1981 to 1985, Nissen fundoplication was performed on 13 esophageal atresia patients. One patient with Down's syndrome died because of cardiac malformation 2 weeks after the operation and is excluded from the analysis. Nine of the remaining 12 patients had the usual malformation with distal fistula, while three had isolated atresia. In eight patients there was a long gap between the segments, and in five Livaditis myotomy was necessary. The median age of the patients at the fundoplication was 1.3 years (range, 4.5 months to 10.6 years). The main clinical manifestations were anastomotic stricture (six patients), respiratory complications (three patients), vomiting and difficulties in feeding (two patients), and esophagitis only (one patient). Altogether nine patients had preoperative distal esophagitis. Mean follow-up time was 4.1 years (range, 2.0 to 6.4 years). All patients primarily benefited from the operation. Routine control endoscopy 3 to 8 months after the operation showed a competent fundoplication in all patients. However, in five patients the reflux later recurred, and endoscopy revealed a partially disrupted fundal wrap and esophagitis. Four patients underwent refundoplication and one is waiting for it as of this writing. Four patients had Barrett's esophagus at the last endoscopic control. There was one late death due to cardiac failure. In conclusion, although the short-term results of Nissen fundoplication in esophageal atresia patients are good, the risk for late recurrence is high. Regular long-term follow-up is therefore necessary.
