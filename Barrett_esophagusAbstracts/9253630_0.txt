AIMS: An increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus has been demonstrated in patients with long segments of Barrett's mucosa. The risk of cancer associated with short segments of metaplasia of the oesophagogastric junction is not known. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a case of early adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus arising on short tongues of Barrett's mucosa associated with an oesophageal cyst. The patient was a 68-year-old man with no previous clinical history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The fortuitous discovery of an oesophageal cyst lead to the diagnosis of short tongues of Barrett's mucosa with high-grade dysplasia. On pathological examination of the resected specimen, an early adenocarcinoma had developed in Barrett's mucosa, localized just above the oesophageal cyst. CONCLUSIONS: As oesophageal cysts can cause symptoms suggestive of reflux, we hypothesize that this association may not be fortuitous.
