BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and treatment of esophageal pathology remains a challenge despite advances in preoperative endoscopy, radiographic staging, and perioperative care. CASE REPORT: In this article, we present an interesting case of esophageal leiomyomatosis in a woman with a history of vulvar leiomyoma and Barrett's esophagus. This paper represents the first reported simultaneous occurrence of these three pathologic entities in the English literature. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation and characteristic pathologic findings in patients with esophageal leiomyomatosis are reviewed. Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to esophageal masses are discussed including the indications for esophageal resection.
