The relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remains controversial. Over 20 studies presented at the 2003 Digestive Disease Week meeting examined the implications of H. pylori infection for GERD. Although the findings were not uniform, most of the studies presented indicated a negative association between the presence of H. pylori and the presence of GERD symptoms, signs, or complications. In addition, eradication of H. pylori infection was related to the emergence of GERD and its complications. However, most studies favored a role for H. pylori rather than GERD in the development of pathologic changes in the gastric cardia. Finally, a few studies suggested the intriguing possibility that the modulation of GERD by H. pylori could be through the effects of H. pylori eradication on weight gain.
