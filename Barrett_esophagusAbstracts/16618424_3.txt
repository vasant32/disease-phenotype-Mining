Imaging and other advanced technologies for detection of gastrointestinal cancers are undergoing a major revolution on several fronts. This is facilitated by convergence of key technologies including advanced endoscopic-detection systems, more specific contrast agents, rapid and high-resolution cross-sectional imaging, and miniaturization of construction systems for making all imaging equipment smaller and less invasive. This convergence is occurring along traditional translational research pathways (clinical medicine-molecular biology) as well as nontraditional lines (clinical medicine-optical physics/engineering and molecular biology-optical physics/engineering). These new efforts are producing a wide array of technologies aimed at improving detection, classification, and monitoring of gastrointestinal neoplasia, especially for colorectal and esophageal cancer because of easier accessibility. A critical goal is to detect lesions at their premalignant stages, thereby permitting meaningful intervention. Inspired by these advances, the American Gastroenterological Association and the National Cancer Institute sponsored a symposium held in Bethesda, MD, from October 4-5, 2004, bringing together leading investigators with diverse backgrounds in imaging technology. The aims of this symposium were to summarize the state of the art and priorities for research in the coming decade in the field of imaging and advanced technology for gastrointestinal neoplasia. In this overview, we summarize the salient results of that symposium. The initial sections discuss the major technologies in each area of endoluminal imaging and molecular imaging followed by applications to specific diseases such as Barrett's esophagus and colon neoplasia. Each section focuses on the current state of the art then lists major priorities for research in the field.
