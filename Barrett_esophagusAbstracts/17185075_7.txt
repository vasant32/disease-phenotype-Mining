 BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life is decreased in patients with GERD and Barrett's esophagus (BE). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether time-tradeoff (TTO) values would differ in patients with BE when patients were asked to trade away the potential risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma rather than chronic heartburn symptoms. DESIGN: A prospective clinical trial. PATIENTS: Subjects with biopsy-proven BE. INTERVENTIONS: Custom-designed computer program to elicit health-state utility values, quality of life in reflux and dyspepsia (QOLRAD), and Medical Outcomes Survey short form-36 surveys. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: TTO utility values for the annual cancer-risk-associated current health state and for hypothetical scenarios of dysplasia and esophageal cancer. RESULTS: We studied 60 patients in the cancer-risk cohort (57 men, 92% veteran; mean age [standard deviation; SD], 65 years [11 years], mean GERD duration 17 years [12 years]). The heartburn cohort included 40 patients with GERD and BE with TTO values derived for GERD symptoms. The mean (SD) utility for nondysplastic BE was 0.91 (0.13) compared with 0.90 (0.12) for the heartburn cohort (P = .7). The mean utility values were significantly lower for scenarios of low-grade dysplasia (0.85 [0.12], P = .02) and high-grade dysplasia (0.77 [0.14], P < .005). The mean TTO was 0.67 (0.19) for the scenario of esophageal cancer. There was no correlation between the utility scores and the disease-specific survey scores. LIMITATIONS: TTO values were hypothetical for states of dysplasia and cancer. CONCLUSIONS: TTO utility values based on heartburn symptoms or annual risk of cancer in patients with nondysplastic BE are roughly equivalent. However, TTO utility values are significantly lower for health states with increasing cancer risks.
