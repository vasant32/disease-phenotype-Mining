BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine before Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) in asymptomatic morbidly obese patients: 1) the prevalence of abnormal findings at upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy; 2) Helicobacter pylori (HP) status; 3) clinical consequences of these findings; and 4) associated costs. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 468 consecutive patients, excluded those with UGI symptoms, drug intake or previous UGI endoscopy/surgery, and analyzed findings in the 319 remaining patients (68%). RESULTS: There were abnormal findings in 147 patients (46%), including 54 hiatal hernias and 146 parietal (i.e. mucosal or submucosal) lesions. The most significant were 7 ulcers and 2 gastric polyposis. HP was detected (using CLO-test) in 124 patients (39%). Histopathological examination of biopsies was abnormal in 109/161 patients (68%), and disclosed mainly chronic gastritis (n=98). Abnormal findings were more frequent in HP-positive compared to HP-negative patients (94 vs 51%, P<0.001). Findings had clinical implications in only 4% of patients: delayed surgery (7 ulcers), prophylactic gastrectomy (2 gastric polyposis), unnecessary work-up (3 irrelevant/false-positive diagnoses), and inclusion in a screening program (1 Barrett's esophagus). Mean cost of complete UGI work-up was 389 euro/patient. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic morbidly obese patients frequently harbour UGI lesions warranting UGI work-up before RYGBP. However, routine endoscopy presents drawbacks. We propose a less invasive strategy which reduces costs and limits false-positive results and the subsequent investigations that they require. In our series, it would have missed two gastric polyposis only, for which no formal recommendation has yet been issued. This strategy could be a valuable alternative to routine UGI endoscopy before RYGBP in asymptomatic patients.
