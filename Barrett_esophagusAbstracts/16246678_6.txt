 BACKGROUND: Assessment of clinical factors associated with Barrett's esophagus (BE) length remained within the realm of anecdotal reports or one center's experience. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine which clinical factors are highly correlated with the length of BE. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with BE were recruited into the study from 5 academic centers in the United States. All patients had an upper endoscopy that documented BE by the presence of intestinal metaplasia in biopsy specimens. All patients were evaluated by a validated demographic questionnaire and the GERD Symptom Checklist. RESULTS: A total of 263 patients with BE were recruited into the study. Mean BE length length for the entire sample was 4 +/- 3.3 cm. A longer hiatal hernia (r = 0.22, p < 0.01), any dysplasia (t = -2.3, p < 0.05), H2 receptor antagonist (H2-RA) consumption (t = 1.98, p < 0.05), and nonsmoking (t = -2.5, p < 0.05) were correlated with a longer segment of BE. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) (t = 1.96, p < 0.05) were correlated with a shorter segment of BE. CONCLUSIONS: PPIs were correlated with shorter lengths of BE. In contrast, a longer hiatal hernia, any dysplasia, nonsmoking, or use of H2-RAs were correlated with a longer BE segment.
