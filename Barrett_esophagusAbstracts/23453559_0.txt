Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the main recognized risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The incidence of this cancer and its associated mortality has increased in developed countries during the last few years. Detection of EAC at earlier stages could potentially improve survival dramatically in these patients, which is especially important as mortality from EAC remains high despite the available treatments. Therefore, endoscopic surveillance is an attractive option for patients with Barrett's esophagus. Consequently, periodic endoscopic surveillance is recommended by all the International Gastroenterology Societies in an attempt to detect EAC at an early and potentially curable stage. Currently, the frequency of endoscopic surveillance and its need in Barrett's esophagus with low-grade dysplasia or without dysplasia are under discussion. This review presents the available evidence in order to assist clinicians in the decision-making process.
