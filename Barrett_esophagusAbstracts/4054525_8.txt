This study describes the clinical, radiologic, esophageal function test, endoscopic, and histologic findings of Barrett's esophagus in 11 children aged 6-14 yr. All had long-standing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, which had begun in the first year of life in 10 of the 11. Eight of the 11 patients had mid or upper esophageal strictures and 10 of the 11 required fundoplication. Most patients had low lower esophageal sphincter pressures and abnormal pH probe studies. Only 6 of the 11 children had the characteristic pink-red appearance of the mucosa at endoscopy. Fifty endoscopic biopsy specimens taken at multiple levels in the esophagus contained columnar-lined epithelium above the gastroesophageal junction. Five of the patients had specialized (intestinal-type) epithelium as part of the histologic spectrum. The clinical expression of Barrett's esophagus in children is similar to that in adults except that strictures appear to be more common in children, and the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa is not always typical in color. As in adults, gastroesophageal reflux appears to be the etiology. In children beyond infancy, Barrett's esophagus is the most common indication for antireflux surgery at our institution. Biopsy specimens should be taken from multiple levels in the esophagus to avoid overdiagnosis and to establish the diagnosis with certainty.
