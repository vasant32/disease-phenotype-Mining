A 31-year-old white man with a history of testicular carcinoma and lymphoma developed severe reflux esophagitis with stricture formation requiring repeated dilatation. Barrett's esophagus was histologically confirmed. The Barrett's mucosa was observed endoscopically and became polypoid, mimicking an esophageal carcinoma. The polyp was evaluated by endoscopic ultrasonography and ultrasonically guided aspiration cytology. It was managed by snare cautery removal, which showed a pyogenic granuloma.
