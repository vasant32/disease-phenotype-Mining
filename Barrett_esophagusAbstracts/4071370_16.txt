Between 1951 and 1983, 32 patients who had adenocarcinoma develop in Barrett's esophagus were identified at our institution. Twenty-nine patients were male (91 per cent) and 29 were white. Amongst the 23 patients in whom the relevant data were available, 78 per cent admitted to regular alcohol intake and 78 per cent smoked. Only one of these patients did not smoke or drink alcohol. Surprisingly, only 61 per cent of the patients had symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux and reflux was demonstrated roentgenographically in only 41 per cent. Twenty-one of the patients underwent esophagogastrectomy. Life table analysis revealed a survival rate of 34 per cent at two years and 14.8 per cent at five years.
