In order to prevent the development of Barrett's esophagus (BE)-related esophageal cancer in China and facilitate the communication of research results among different centers, we propose using standardized diagnostic criteria and taking a conservative approach to diagnose and manage BE patients. BE patients without dysplasia need to be treated medically. For low-grade dysplasia, an annual endoscopy with biopsies is recommended, along with medical therapy. For high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal carcinoma, an endoscopic or surgical intervention is suggested. All BE patients should be followed up closely.
