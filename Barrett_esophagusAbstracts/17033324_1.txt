In Western countries, many esophageal diseases result from uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux. Treatments for Barrett esophagus, peptic strictures, and esophageal adenocarcinoma still account for a large portion of the esophageal interventions performed by therapeutic endoscopists. In addition to continued refinements in the treatment of these sequelae, new endoscopic therapies have emerged to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease itself. This article reviews the available literature on new endoscopic antireflux procedures along with other advances that give the endoscopist unprecedented options in the treatment of esophageal diseases.
