 GOALS: To measure esophageal wall thickness (EWT) with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in patients with and without Barrett's esophagus (BE). BACKGROUND: Segment length and histology are used to evaluate BE. The development of varying depths of ablation therapy has renewed interest in using EUS for BE. STUDY: In this prospective study, EWT measurements were taken from the balloon-mucosal interface to the outer most hyper-echoic line. These measurements were correlated with the highest grade of BE dysplasia and segment length, and then compared with the measurements from control group. RESULTS: Between 2004 to 2007, 76 BE patients (69 men, mean age 68 y, 4 ND, 14 low-grade dysplasia, 52 high-grade dysplasia, 6 carcinoma in situ) and 53 normal controls (18 men, mean age 60 y) underwent EUS. The mean EWT was 2.4 mm for controls, 3.1 mm for nondysplastic BE, 3.2 mm for low-grade dysplasia, 3.4 mm for high-grade dysplasia, and 3.9 mm for carcinoma in situ. In the control group of 53 patients, the mean EWT was 2.4 mm. Compared with normal controls, the mean EWT was significantly greater in all histologic subgroups of BE patients (P<0.001). No statistically significant correlation was seen between EWT and BE histology grade. There were no correlations between age, gender, or BE segment length and EWT (P=0.55). CONCLUSIONS: EWT is greater among patients with BE compared with control patients; however, there were no systematic differences in EWT were found among BE patients, based on histology and segment length.
