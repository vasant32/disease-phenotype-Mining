Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the principal risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. BE patients currently undergo periodic endoscopic surveillance with tissue sampling and histopathologic assessment for dysplasia. They frequently are prescribed proton pump inhibitors to pharmacologically suppress gastric acid that is the cause of BE. These standard endoscopic and pharmacologic approaches for managing BE are crude at best. Identification of novel tissue biomarkers within BE may allow for more accurate endoscopic risk stratification and provide potential targets for chemoprevention.
