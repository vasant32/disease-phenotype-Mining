 BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux is a frequent problem after esophageal atresia (EA) repair. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of esophagitis and Barrett esophagus more than 10 years after repair of EA. METHODS: Ninety-two patients treated between 1973 and 1985 were included in this prospective study. A questionnaire was completed by 86 patients; esophagogastroscopy was performed in 49 patients. RESULTS: Only 36 patients had no complaints at all. Thirty-one patients complained of difficulties swallowing solid food; 23 complained of heartburn. Esophagogastroscopy revealed grade 3 esophagitis in 2 patients and a macroscopic image of Barrett esophagus in 2. Histology showed esophagitis in 30 patients, gastric metaplasia in 3, and no intestinal metaplasia (Barrett esophagus). CONCLUSIONS: For epidemiologic reasons, that is, the short interval of follow-up (10 years) and the low compliance of the study group, larger numbers are needed to decide if routine long-term endoscopic screening after repair of EA is necessary. For now, it cannot yet be recommended. The prevalence of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease in this study group is higher than that in the general population, but we found no severe complications of gastroesophageal reflux in the pediatric age group.
