Barrett's esophagus is defined as a disorder in which the normal stratified squamous mucosa of the esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium. Patients with Barrett's esophagus are at risk to develop an adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Pathologic gastroesophageal reflux is correlated to the disease and therapeutical options must aim to stop this noxa in order to prevent columnar metaplasia, and subsequent dysplasia and/or neoplasia. The Authors report the case of a patient in whom the complete regression of the metaplasia was observed after medical therapy.
