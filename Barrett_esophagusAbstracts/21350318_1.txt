Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined as a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. In the last decade, GERD has been increasing in Korea. Seventeen consensus statements for the treatment of GERD were developed using the modified Delphi approach. Acid suppression treatments, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histmine-2 receptor antagonists and antacids are effective in the control of GERD-related symptoms. Among them, PPIs are the most effective medication. Standard dose PPI is recommended as the initial treatment of erosive esophagitis (for 8 weeks) and non-erosive reflux disease (at least for 4 weeks). Long-term continuous PPI or on-demand therapy is required for the majority of GERD patients after the initial treatment. Anti-reflux surgery can be considered in well selected patients. Prokinetic agents and mucosal protective drugs have limited roles. Twice daily PPI therapy can be tried to control extra-esophageal symptoms of GERD. For symptomatic patients with Barrett's esophagus, long-term treatment with PPI is required. Further studies are strongly needed to develop better treatment strategies for Korean patients with GERD.
