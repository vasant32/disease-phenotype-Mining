OBJECTIVE: To study the esophageal motor disorders in patients with Barrett's esophagus after surgical treatment. DESIGN: From January 1993 to September 1998 a prospective study with 25 patients referred to our service for surgical treatment of Barrett's esophagus was conducted. Barium transit, endoscopy, 24-hour monitoring of intraluminal pH and stationary esophageal manometry were carried out in all patients pre- and postoperatively. The results were compared before and after surgery. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PATIENTS: 18 male (72%) and 7 women (28%). Mean age was 54.20 +/- 13.29 years (range: 25-71 years). The most frequent clinical manifestation was heartburn (92%). A laparotomy procedure was performed in 68% (n = 17) and laparoscopy in 32% (n = 8) of patients. A 360 degrees fundoplication was always performed. RESULTS: 96% of patients presented a defective lower esophageal sphincter. The statistical study demonstrated significant differences after surgery for all pH-metric parameters and lower esophageal sphincter (p < 0.01), except for relaxation (p = 0.465). In the esophageal body, the statistical study only demonstrated significant differences for mean pressure of the peristaltic waves in segment I (p = 0.038) and mean rate of non-transmitted waves in esophageal segment IV-V (p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Antireflux surgery in Barrett's esophagus contributes to the control of gastroesophageal reflux improving esophageal clearing and with significant differences for the mean rate of non-transmitted waves in the distal esophagus.
