 BACKGROUND: A number of case reports have described the application of minimally invasive surgical techniques to accomplish esophagectomy. However, most reports have employed thoracoscopic or laparoscopic techniques to perform esophagectomy in addition to an "access" incision which often approaches a standard laparotomy or thoracotomy. CASE REPORT: This report describes a total laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy in a 55 year old female with Barrett's esophagus and high grade dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on the fourth day after a total laparoscopic esophagectomy. This report demonstrates the technical feasibility of this complex procedure by a minimally invasive approach.
