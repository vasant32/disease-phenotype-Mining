As of 1975, forty-nine cases of adenocarcinoma arising in the columnar-lined lower esophagus (CLLE) were reported in the literature. We add three more cases, including the youngest male to our knowledge. All survived esophagogastrectomy and radiotherapy, but each had metastatic disease and a guarded prognosis. Review of the literature revealed a male/female ratio of 3:1 for this disorder with a mean age for men of 53 years, less than that for women, (61 women). Columnar-lined lower esophagus is seen in up to 11% of patients with reflux esophagitis and probably does not regress, once present. Adenocarcinoma later develops in 2.4% to 8.5%. The CLLE is not rare and should be followed up as carefully as any other premalignant lesion.
