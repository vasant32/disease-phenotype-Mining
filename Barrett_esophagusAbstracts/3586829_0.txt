The incidence of the squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus shows geographical variations. As a rule it is found in heavy smokers and alcoholics. Multicentricity (mouth, hypopharynx, esophagus) is very frequent and accompanied by large dysplasias of different stages. The adenocarcinoma develops on the metaplastic cylindric epithelium of the Barrett esophagus. Positive dysplasias are highly suspicious of the development of a carcinoma and demand the reconfirmation of the finding by a second pathologist. In this case the resection of the esophagus has to be done. The abdominal-cervical method should be preferred.
