The presence of multiple esophageal polyps on endoscopy is a rare entity. Most of the literature cited on this phenomenon is based on case reports and small series. A large proportion of the literature describes one or two polyps, with the majority of polyps occurring in the area of the gastroesophageal junction. We present a case of a 66-year-old woman with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease that was found to have extensive esophageal polyposis of the mid-esophagus on upper endoscopy. The patient underwent a transhiatal esophagectomy. Final pathology was consistent with extensive polypoid dysplasia in the presence of Barrett's esophagus.
