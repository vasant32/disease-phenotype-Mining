The incidence of esophageal cancer, especially esophageal adenocarcinoma, is increasing and its high mortality rate is a notable fact. Improving survival rates of this disease depend on earlier detection through screening and surveillance; however, standard diagnostic modalities, such as endoscopy with biopsy, have several limitations as screening tools, including low negative predictive value and relatively high cost. Recently developed biomarkers such as FISH and improved imaging techniques, may help overcome current problems and provide improved screening and surveillance for esophageal cancer.
