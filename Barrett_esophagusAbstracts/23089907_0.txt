 BACKGROUND/AIMS: The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and its association with reflux esophagitis (RE) and peptic ulcer disease detected by free charge endoscopy which was covered by the National Health Insurance at a secondary care hospital, and to compare the results of the biopsy of BE with that of cardiac intestinal metaplasia (CIM). METHODS: A total of 4,002 patients underwent endoscopy from March 2010 to December 2012. BE was diagnosed if there was histologically proven specialized intestinal metaplasia, and CIM was diagnosed if intestinal metaplasia was accompanied with chronic gastritis. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty four patients underwent endoscopic biopsy, and the prevalence of BE was 1.0% (42/4,002). The mean age and the proportion of males in BE were significantly higher than those of the rest of study population, and BE had slight tendency related to RE than the rest of study population. CIM was observed in 34 patients and BE and CIM showed similar results, regarding age, sex and association with RE. The mean length of endoscopic Barrett's mucosa of BE group was 9.2Â±5.1 mm, and it was similar to that of CIM. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of BE in the secondary care hospital was not low, and old age and male sex were significantly associated with BE. Because BE was observed in about 10% of biopsied patients and CIM was observed in a similar percentage with BE, the precise targeted biopsy is warranted and the biopsy method should be reestablished through the large prospective study of multiple secondary care hospitals.
