 BACKGROUND: Duodenal-Gastro-Esophageal Reflux (DGER) represents an independent risk factor for the development of complicated Gastro-esophageal-reflux-disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus. Clinical and epidemiological data suggest a potential association between cholecystectomy (CCE) and augmented bile reflux. METHODS: 132 patients (67 women, 65 men, median age 55) with typical symptoms of GERD were enrolled in the study and divided in cholecystectomized (CCE-group: n = 107) and non- cholecystectomized (nCCE-group: n = 25) patients. Standardized clinical work-up of patients included combined esophageal 24 h pH-measurement and Bilitec 2000 esophageal manometry and upper endoscopy. RESULTS: In the statistical analysis no differences between the cholecystectomized group (CCE-group, n = 25) and the patients without cholecystectomy (nCCE-group, n = 107) could be observed in quantity or quality of reflux symptoms. Furthermore, neither acid reflux nor severity of inflammation and frequency of Barrett's esophagus significantly differed between the nCCE and CCE-group. However, the percentage of patients with pathological DGER were significantly higher in the CCE-group as compared to the nCCE-group (76 vs. 55 %, p < 0.01). Moreover, the CCE-group revealed significant higher levels of pathological DGER compared to the nCCE-group (15.5 % +/- 14.1 vs. 8.6 % +/- 15.4; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: To conclude, our data provide first evidence of elevated DGER after CCE in patients with typical clinical symptoms of GERD using the Bilitec device. Both the frequency and the extent of DGER was significantly increased in the CCE-group. Prospective studies are urgently needed to elucidate the impact of CCE on DGER in patients with clinical symptoms of a reflux disease.
