 BACKGROUND: The management of high-grade esophageal dysplasia has included surveillance, endoscopic ablative techniques, and esophagectomy. Herein we describe an alternative treatment, laparoscopic transgastric esophageal mucosal resection. METHODS: Laparoscopic transgastric esophageal mucosal resection was accomplished through an anterior gastrotomy. The mucosa was stripped from the Z-line to the proximal extent of the abnormal epithelium. The gastrotomy then was closed with a linear stapler, and a Nissen fundoplication was performed. RESULTS: Six patients with high-grade dysplasia of the distal esophagus underwent mucosal resection. After 4 to 7 years of endoscopic surveillance, all patients have regenerated squamous epithelium. One patient developed nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus after 2 years and was treated medically. Two strictures were treated successfully with dilatation. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic transgastric esophageal mucosal resection was a reasonable treatment for high-grade dysplasia in this small sample of patients. This technique is a potential alternative treatment for high-grade dysplasia of the esophagus.
