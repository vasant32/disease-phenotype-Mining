 BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been regarded as the most accurate staging tool in esophageal cancer. Staging results have a strong impact on the decision as to whether a patient should undergo endoscopic treatment, surgery alone, or neoadjuvant therapy. This retrospective study was conducted to analyze the accuracy of esophageal cancer staging using EUS. METHODS: All patients who received EUS for staging of esophageal cancer before esophagectomy from February 2003 to December 2007 at a high volume academic tertiary care center were included. RESULTS: 179 consecutive patients (mean age 64.4 +/- 9.5 years; 142 men) underwent esophageal resection for Barrett's adenocarcinoma (n = 134) and squamous cell cancer (n = 45). Postoperatively, 99 patients were staged as having T1 cancers (55 %), 30 patients T2 (17%), 46 patients T3 (26%), and four patients T4 (2%). The sensitivity and specificity of EUS relative to the T stage were 82% and 91%, respectively, for T1; 43% and 85% for T2; and 83% and 86% for T3. The overall accuracy for EUS in identifying the correct T stage was 74% (95%CI 66-80). Positive lymph nodes were diagnosed histologically in 68 patients (38%). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of EUS for the diagnosis of N1 were 71%, 74% and 73% (95%CI 65-79), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of EUS in patients with esophageal cancer is still unsatisfactory. T2 cancers in particular are frequently overstaged, with a significant effect on the subsequent treatment strategy.
