The management of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus has clearly changed over recent years. The risk of cancer development is still substantial, with about one in three patients developing cancer, but a number of patients do not develop cancer. The nature of high-grade dysplasia has also been genetically elucidated with more evidence of chromosomal instability being present at this stage than previously thought. Therapy of the condition has evolved more toward endoscopic therapy, given the good results of radio-frequency ablation and photodynamic therapy in eliminating dysplasia and decreasing cancer development in randomized controlled trial. The best candidates for treatment include compliant patients that have relatively short segments of Barrett's esophagus, an anatomically straight segment, lack of nodularity, and an intact p16. However, even with excellent long-term results similar to surgical resection, the risk of recurrence is present in over 14% of patients, which indicates that there will be a need to continue surveillance endoscopy in these patients.
