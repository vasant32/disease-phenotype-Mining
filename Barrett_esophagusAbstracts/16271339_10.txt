 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Barrett's esophagus is traditionally considered a disease of older white men. The aims of this study were to compare the demographic features of Barrett's esophagus in men and women and to determine the prevalence and incidence of high-grade dysplasia and cancer in these patients. METHODS: All patients enrolled in the Cleveland Clinic Barrett's Esophagus Registry from 1979-2002 were studied. Age, ethnicity, number of endoscopies, hiatal hernia size, length of Barrett's segment, and prevalence and incidence of high-grade dysplasia and cancer were compared between men and women. RESULTS: There were 839 patients in the registry (628 men and 211 women). Barrett's segment length was greater in men than in women (mean, 5.06 +/- 4.2 vs 4.05 +/- 3.27 cm, respectively; P = .003). There were no significant differences for other parameters. There were 114 prevalence cases of high-grade dysplasia or cancer (96 men, 18 women). Women were less likely to have prevalent high-grade dysplasia or cancer than men (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.88; P = .015). There were 13 incidence cases of high-grade dysplasia or cancer (11 men, 2 women) during a mean follow-up of 4.72 years, which was similar in both genders with an incidence rate of 1 in 179 patient-years of follow-up for women and 1 in 91 patient-years of follow-up in men. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five percent of patients in our registry are women. The length of Barrett's esophagus is greater in men than in women, but other features are similar. The prevalence of high-grade dysplasia/cancer in women is approximately half that of men. Incidence rates for high-grade dysplasia/cancer are similar in men and women, although the number of cases is small.
