We report a case of a 38-yr-old man presenting with dysphagia due to stricturing of an isolated patch of heterotopic acid-secreting gastric mucosa ("inlet patch") in the proximal esophagus who was successfully treated with endoscopic thermal coagulation while receiving acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor. Follow-up endoscopy at 15 months after completion of therapy revealed repopulation of the heterotopic gastric mucosa with normal squamous epithelium and continued resolution of the patient's symptoms. The clinical significance of the inlet patch is discussed, and the role of mucosal ablation in treatment of this entity is described.
