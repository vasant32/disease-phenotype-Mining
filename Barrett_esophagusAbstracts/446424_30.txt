We have undertaken esophagoscopy 1/2 to 17 1/2 years after surgery in 20 patients with a total gastrectomy and an esophago-jejunal anastomosis. In 5 cases we found a complete columnar lining of the distal esophagus (Barrett-esophagus). 2 other cases showed a multilocular columnar epithelium. One case with a Barrett-esophagus had endoscopy before surgery, and it could be proved that the columnar lining developed after surgery. We suspect that it was the same in the remaining cases. All examined patients, except one, showed an erosive esophagitis of varying severity. These observations support the current view that the columnar lined esophagus is usually an acquired one. The pathogenesis is not completely clear, but reflux of digestive juices destroying the squamous epithelium and impairing healing is the condition for columnar lining. The observations on patients with total gastrectomy prove that it must not necessarily be gastric juice. The very urgent question of the origin of columnar lining cannot be answered at present.
