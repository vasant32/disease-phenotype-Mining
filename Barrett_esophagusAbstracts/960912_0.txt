The work-up of patients with benign diseases of the esophagus should start with a diagnostic evaluation. This includes a carefully taken history, radiologic and endoscopic examinations and, in suspected reflux disease, recording of intraesophageal pH. For the evaluation of functional troubles esophageal manometry is recommended. Patients with complicated reflux disease and failures of antireflux treatment should be operated upon. In high peptic stenoses, Barrett's syndrome should be carefully looked for. Achalasia is treated by pneumatic dilatations with more than 90% good or satisfactory results. But diffuse esophageal spasm is little responsive to therapy. There is a risk of secondary carcinoma in Barrett's syndrome, achalasia, caustic lesions and Plummer-Vinson syndrome. Therefore these patients should be seen at regular intervals. There is an urgent need for controlled studies evaluating the comparative results of medical and surgical therapy.
