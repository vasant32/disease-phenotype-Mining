We describe the clinical, endoscopic, and histological features of all cases of Barrett's esophagus (BE) diagnosed at our institution between 2000 and 2007 following the criteria of the British Society of Gastroenterology. This society defines BE as a segment of columnar metaplasia (CLO) (whether intestinalized or not) of any length, visible endoscopically above the gastroesophageal junction and confirmed histologically. The diagnosis was challenged after immunostaining for Cdx2 (marker of intestinal differentiation). Information was collected with respect to age, symptoms, treatment, and endoscopic and histological features. Twelve children (10 males and 2 females) with a median age of 11.7 (2 to 17) years had been diagnosed with CLO-BE. Histology confirmed BE in 31 of 38 endoscopies. The initial diagnosis was reviewed according to Cdx2 results in 10 of 12 patients: Cdx2 strongly expressed in 4 cases with intestinal metaplasia (the diagnosis of BE was maintained); was negative in 4 other patients with "CLO" mucosa (reviewed diagnosis was that of expansion of the gastric cardia into the distal esophagus); and 2 patients had occasional Cdx2-positive cells showing cardia-type mucosa with goblet cells (early BE?). The estimated prevalence of CLO-BE in the pediatric population of South Yorkshire (United Kingdom) is 0.0024%, 0.8% in children referred for endoscopy and 5.5% in the children with reflux esophagitis. Characterization of the BE and confirmation of intestinal differentiation may have prognostic implications that can impact the surveillance program. Our results showed that intestinal differentiation as demonstrated with Cdx2 was only seen if goblet cells were present. A consensus definition and further studies to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of BE at this age are needed.
