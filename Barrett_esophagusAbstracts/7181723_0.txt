We studied 34 consecutive children from 6 m to 10 yr presenting gastroesophageal reflux (GER) with or without hiatal hernia. There was a high incidence of stenosis: 28 (80%) children presented with stenosis of the esophagus from mild to severe degree and 20 of them (70%) developed shortened or Barrett's esophagus. This data suggest that in our serie the diagnosis of GER has been delayed or medical therapy has been inadequate or excessively prolonged. The surgical treatment of GER with or without stenosis is the Nissen fundoplication. Our first cases of shortened esophagus were treated by intrathoracic Nissen fundoplication, which was considered an extensive and major risk surgery. Lately, for these cases we have been utilizing the gastro-fundoplication without opening of the chest. This is an easier surgery, through which we could reach good results without serious postoperative complications.
