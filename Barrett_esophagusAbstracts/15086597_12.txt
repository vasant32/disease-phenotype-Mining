 BACKGROUND AND AIM: Barrett's metaplasia is a premalign condition which plays a pivotal role in the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. It is considered a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease. Although esophageal adenocarcinoma is an uncommon cancer, its incidence is rapidly increasing. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of Barrett's metaplasia in outpatients referred for gastroscopy for upper gastrointestinal symptoms, and to clarify the relationship between Barrett's metaplasia and upper gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: Three-hundred and ninety-five consecutive dyspeptic patients, never previously investigated, underwent gastroscopy and were enrolled into the study. RESULTS: Barrett's metaplasia was detected in 29 patients (7.4%). The age-specific prevalence of Barrett's metaplasia increased with age. In multivariate analysis, Barrett's metaplasia was independently and positively related to age, sex and duration of symptoms, but not with upper gastrointestinal symptoms. In univariate analysis, Barrett's metaplasia was significantly more common in patients with antral intestinal metaplasia (24%) and presence of hiatal hernia (65.5%), compared with those with normal endoscopic findings (6.2% and 39.2%, respectively, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Symptoms do not predict Barrett's metaplasia. Barrett's metaplasia is age-related and more common in patients with a longer duration of symptoms, presence of hiatal hernia and antral intestinal metaplasia.
