BACKGROUND: There is a possible relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and overweight, that has not been studied extensively. AIM: To study the association between overweight and gastroesophageal reflux in a group of patients and normal controls. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Body mass index of 85 patients with gastroesophageal reflux and 100 patients with Barrett esophagus, was compared with that of 171 healthy controls. RESULTS: There were no differences in body mass index between healthy subjects and patients with gastroesophageal reflux. However, there was a higher proportion of overweight males and obese females with Barrett esophagus than among healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find an association between overweight and gastroesophageal reflux, but patients with Barrett esophagus had a higher body mass index than normal controls.
