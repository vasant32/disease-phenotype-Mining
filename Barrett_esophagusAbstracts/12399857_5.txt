Laparoscopic fundoplication is now considered the treatment of choice for the management of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications. The laparoscopic approach achieves the same good results as open surgery in elective surgery for GERD; it also has all the advantages of minimally invasive surgery. Today, laparoscopy plays also a significant role in a great variety of emergency abdominal situations and acute abdominal pain. A 30-year-old man was admitted to our center due to an upper gastrointestinal bleed caused by a esophageal ulcer over a Barrett's esophagus located in lower third of the esophagus. Two therapeutic esophagogastroscopies were done in 24 h, but urgent surgical intervention was indicated because of recurrent transfusion-demanding bleeding. A combined laparoscopic-endoscopic approach was followed. Surgery began with a complete hiatal dissection, including the distal third of the esophagus, diaphragmatic crus, and wide retrogastric window. Intraoperative flexible esophagoscopy revealed an active ulcer bleeding on the right anterior quadrant in the lower esophagus. Two transfixive stitches were applied through the wall of the esophagus at the site indicated by the light of the flexible endoscope, and complete hemostasis was achieved. Finally, employing the anterior wall of the fundus, a short Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication was performed. The operating time was 140 min. There were no complications and there has been no recurrence of the bleeding.
