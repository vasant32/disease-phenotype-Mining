The main indications for laser therapy in the gastrointestinal tract are inoperable tumors of the esophagus, cardia and the recto-sigmoid. Exophytic tumors with a maximum length of the tumor stenoses between 5 and 7 cm are the best candidates for laser treatment. In gastroenterological stone centers, the laser-induced intracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is now established. The sophisticated principle of the so-called photodynamic therapy is still in an experimental stage. Photodynamic therapy offers the option of curative therapy in small malignant or premalignant (Barrett esophagus with severe dysplasia) lesions.
