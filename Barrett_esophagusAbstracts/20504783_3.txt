 BACKGROUND: Chronic radiation proctitis can be difficult to manage. Radiofrequency ablation has recently been shown to be effective in the management of gastric antral vascular ectasia and Barrett's esophagus, but its utility in the treatment of chronic radiation proctitis is undetermined. METHOD: A 77-year-old man with extensive chronic radiation proctitis had continued bleeding despite argon plasma coagulation. The HALO(90) radiofrequency system (BARRX Medical, Sunnyvale, CA) was used for treatment regions of proctitis at an energy density of 12 J/cm(2). RESULTS: At monthly intervals, over 3 months, radiofrequency ablation was performed with a mean of 7 regions ablated at a time. The mean treatment time was 29 minutes. There was no significant bleeding after the first treatment session. The patient was symptom free at 6 months follow-up with minimal evidence of residual mucosal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation appears feasible for treatment of refractory chronic radiation proctitis, with further studies required.
