In 30 patients with reflux oesophagitis, the mucosal microvessels have been studied by transmission electron microscopy. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that a microvascular injury is involved in reflux oesophagitis, and to clarify if the epithelial metaplasia is correlated with a contemporaneous modification of the microvasculature in Barrett's oesophagus. In squamous epithelium-lined mucosa, signs of microangiopathy were found in all patients and capillaries regularly showed an interrupted, duplicated, or thickened basal lamina. In areas of columnar metaplasia, capillaries showed an ectatic lumen and a thin basal lamina without duplications or interruptions; endothelial cells had a thin rim of cytoplasm with many fenestrations. These findings demonstrate that microangiopathy is associated with epithelial damage in reflux oesophagitis.
