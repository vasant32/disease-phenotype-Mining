In a recent evaluation by comparative genomic hybridization, we demonstrated chromosome 14q31-32.1 to be frequently deleted in adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction. This suggests the presence of a tumor suppressor gene in the deleted region. In the present study, we have performed a detailed loss of heterozygosity analysis in 34 gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas and 1 tumor-corresponding dysplastic Barrett's epithelium sample with 37 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Thirty-five markers are in the 14q24.3-32.33 region with a mean distance of 800 kilo base pairs. Of 34 tumor samples, 14 (41%) showed loss of 14q markers. We identified a minimal region of allelic loss of 7105440 base pairs between markers D14S1000 and D14S256 at cytogenetic location 14q31.1-32.11. Within this region, markers D14S1035, D14S55, D14S1037, D14S1022, D14S1052, D14S974, D14S73, D14S1033, D14S67, D14S68, and D14S1058 showed loss in all informative tumors with 14q loss. The region between markers D14S1000 and D14S256 contains 7 known genes. The identification of this minimal deletion and the data base information on the genes present in this region facilitate the search for the candidate tumor suppressor gene(s).
