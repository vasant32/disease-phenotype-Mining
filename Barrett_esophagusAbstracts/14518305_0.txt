p53 mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of adenocarcinomas in Barrett's esophagus. Our study included patients with histopathologically classified Barrett's cancer and shows that p53 mutations are clinically important for curatively resected (R0) Barrett's cancer. It appears that the p53 mutation status is a promising parameter for the definition of risk groups after potentially curative resections.
