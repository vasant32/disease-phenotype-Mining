p53 mutation is a common genetic change in human cancers, but the clinical significance is controversial. We studied 68 patients and estimate the prevalence of intestinal metaplasia of cardia (IMC), Barrett's esophagus (BE), and p53 protein overexpression, and described molecular alterations of p53 gene exons 5 to 8. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive p53 in 56.1-39.1% (IMC) and 60.9% (BE). Molecular analysis showed 36.6% altered cases in exon 5 and 9.8% in exon 7. In conclusion, p53 protein overexpression is common in IMC and BE. The molecular alterations observed may be due to LOH, genomic instability or other unknown alteration.
