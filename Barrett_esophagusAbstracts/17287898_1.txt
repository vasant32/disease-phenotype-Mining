 BACKGROUND: We have shown previously that stromal genetic alteration may make a greater contribution to early genesis of ulcerative colitis-associated tumors than sporadic colon cancers. We assessed whether similar differences in genetic alteration might exist between squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and Barrett's adenocarcinomas (BACs) of the esophagus. METHODS: We investigated epithelial and stromal genetic instability with five National Cancer Institute standard (NCI), four chromosome 17 (Chr. 17), and six tumor suppressor gene (TSG) microsatellite markers in 26 SCC and 12 BAC cases and in 11 normal controls, using a novel combination of microdissection, polymerase chain reaction, and GeneScan. RESULTS: Frequency of epithelial loss of heterozygosity (LOH) increased in the order background mucosa, to precursor lesions, to tumors with both types of carcinoma, especially for the Chr. 17 and TSG markers, while stromal LOH was relatively high but consistent from background mucosa to carcinoma. Epithelial LOH of D17S796 demonstrated a significantly higher frequency in SCCs than in BACs, without significant variation in p53 overexpression. The frequency of microsatellite instability (MSI) showed constant high levels in both epithelium and stroma of background, dysplasia, and carcinomas in the SCC series, and rather low frequencies in the BAC series. Although epithelial hMLH1 and hMSH2 expression decreased with tumor progression, no correlation was found with the individual MSI status. CONCLUSIONS: Although epithelial LOH exists similarly in both lesion types, whereas epithelial and stromal MSI may occur in a relatively early phase of SCC development, stromal MSI is rare in BACs, strongly suggesting differences in tumorigenesis between the two types.
