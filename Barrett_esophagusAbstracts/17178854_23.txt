The precursor metaplastic mucosal lesion that predisposes for esophageal adenocarcinoma is Barrett's esophagus. Because the signal transduction events that occur in Barrett's esophagus are poorly understood, this study aimed at generating a comprehensive description of cellular kinase activity in Barrett's esophagus, normal squamous esophagus, and gastric cardia to gain more insight into the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus. Peptide arrays, exhibiting 1,176 specific consensus sequences for protein kinases, were used to produce a global analysis of cellular kinase activity in biopsies of Barrett's esophagus, and results were compared with the neighboring cardia and squamous epithelia. Several differences in kinase activity using immunoblot analysis and enzyme activity assays were validated in biopsies of 27 Barrett's esophagus patients. Three unique kinome profiles are described and compared. We identified cascades of activated kinases showing that mitogen-activated protein kinase and epidermal growth factor receptor activity are both significantly altered in Barrett's esophagus compared with squamous and gastric cardia epithelia. Another novel finding is that the glycolysis pathway is significantly up-regulated in Barrett's esophagus, which is illustrated by an up-regulated pyruvate kinase activity. Here, the unique kinome profile of Barrett's esophagus is made available as a comprehensive database. Several signaling pathways are revealed as specifically expressed in Barrett's esophagus when compared with the adjacent normal epithelia. These unique findings provide novel insight in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus that will ultimately help to resolve the increasing problem of Barrett's esophagus and prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
