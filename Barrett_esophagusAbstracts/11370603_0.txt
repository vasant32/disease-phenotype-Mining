BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of dysplasia and early cancer of the esophagus could show good results in the potential of ablation. Unfortunately, the existing expensive and temperamental dye laser systems foiled a broad clinical use. In this pilot study, we investigated the feasibility of an inexpensive and maintenance-free diode laser system for PDT of dysplasia and early cancer in Barrett's esophagus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with Barrett's esophagus and/or early cancer were treated. As light source we used a diode laser system with a maximum power output of 2 W and a wavelength of 633 +/- 3 nm. One patient was treated initially with Photosan-3, seven patients received 5-aminolevulinic acid. RESULTS: In all patients we could achieve reduction in length and/or histologically proven downgrading. In three quarters of the patients, complete eradication of adenocarcinoma could be attained. Columnar-lined metaplastic epithelium could also be completely eradicated. CONCLUSION: PDT using a diode laser system is comparably effective in Barrett's esophagus/early cancer as PDT with dye laser systems. PDT is a gentle and effective technique with little side effects.
