A series of 90 rats underwent a duodenoesophageal reflux surgery were divided into 2 groups: the control group was given a commercial chow and the celecoxib group experimental chow containing celecoxib. The animals were sacrificed sequentially every 10 weeks after surgery. In the control group, esophagitis, columnar-lined epithelium (CLE) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) were first observed at the 10th, 20th, and 30th week, respectively, and their incidences sequentially increased and reached 100%, 89% and 47% at the 40th week, respectively. In the celecoxib group, the esophagitis was mild and the incidence of CLE was significantly lower at each week compared with the control group. ADC was not observed in the celecoxib group throughout the experiment. Celecoxib suppressed esophagitis and subsequent CLE and ADC in rats.
