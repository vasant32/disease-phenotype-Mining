Allelic loss on chromosome 17 in 18 Barrett's oesophageal tumours was analysed with 17 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of one or more markers was seen in 72% (13 of 18) tumours on 17p and 56% (10 of 18) on 17q. The highest 17p losses were found at D17S799 (62%, five of eight) and D17S261 (55%, five of nine), while loss at the p53 locus was 31% (5 of 16). The highest loss on 17q was found at the TCF-2 (17q11.2-q12) locus with 66% (8 of 12) LOH. TCF-2 was the only marker lost in two of the tumour samples; furthermore, TCF-2 was lost in four other tumours which retained heterozygosity at the markers on either side of it, D17S261 and D17S740. Six markers were used to assess LOH at 17q11.2-q12, and five of eight of the tumour specimens which had LOH at TCF-2 had no other loss on 17q. No statistically significant correlations were found between loss on 17q or 17p and any clinicopathological parameters. We propose from these data that the 17q11.2-q12 region contains a novel predisposing gene in Barrett's adenocarcinomas and may represent the site of a tumour-suppressor gene.
