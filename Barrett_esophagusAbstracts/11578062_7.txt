PURPOSE: An immunohistochemical study of p53, c-erbB-2, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia and adenocarcinoma, arising from experimental acid or alkaline reflux, was performed in dogs. METHODS: Cardiectomy was performed in group A (n = 26) as an acid reflux model, and total gastrectomy was performed in group B (n = 24) as an alkaline reflux model. After surgery, the esophageal mucosa was observed and biopsied endoscopically every 3 months over a period of 6 years. Immunohistochemical staining of p53. c-erbB-2, and PCNA was performed, using biopsied specimens. RESULTS: In group A, Barrett's esophagus developed in 14 of the 26 dogs. Low-grade dysplasia occurred in 5 of the 26 dogs, and in 1 of these 5 dogs, it developed into high-grade dysplasia. In this animal, adenocarcinoma arose 63 months after the operation. In group B, Barrett's esophagus developed in 10 of the 24 dogs. Low-grade dysplasia was observed in 4 of the 24 dogs. In 1 of these 4 dogs, the dysplasia became high-grade and adenocarcinoma occurred 66 months after the operation. In group A, PCNA was positive in adenocarcinoma; the PCNA labeling index (LI) was 58. c-erbB-2 and p53 were negative in all animals in group A. In group B, PCNA was positive in Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma; the PCNA LI was 77. p53 was positive in adenocarcinoma. c-erbB-2 was negative in adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS; The results of this study provided evidence of the dysplasia-carcinoma sequence arising from alkaline reflux, as well as from acid reflux. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of an alkaline reflux model and a 6-year study using dogs to observe the course of Barrett's esophagus.
