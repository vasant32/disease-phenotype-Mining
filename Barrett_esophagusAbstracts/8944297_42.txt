PURPOSE: To study the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and the development of laryngeal cancer in patients who lack other accepted risk factors for the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of patients either treated surgically or with radiation therapy for stage 1 or stage 2 laryngeal carcinoma with specific reference to smoking history and the presence of GERD. RESULTS: We present 9 lifetime nonsmoking patients with stage 1 or 2 laryngeal carcinoma in whom GERD was clinically and/or radiographically shown. Also, 14 patients are identified who quit smoking more than 15 years before the development of laryngeal cancer and who also had evidence of GERD. CONCLUSION: We propose that the development of laryngeal carcinoma in this cohort of patients who lack typical risk factors supports the notion that GERD plays a role in the etiology of carcinoma of the larynx. Because the accepted risk factors for laryngeal carcinoma such as smoking and alcohol use increase the likelihood of reflux, GERD may act as a cocarcinogen in smokers and drinkers. Of interest, the treatment of GERD can reverse the signs of chronic laryngitis and should be instituted in patients with laryngeal pathology who have GERD.
