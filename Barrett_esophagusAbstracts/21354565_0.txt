 BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus (BE) in children has been examined in retrospective studies, consisting of case series and cross-sectional studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and determinants of BE in children who are free from neurodevelopmental disorders and tracheoesophageal abnormalities. DESIGN: A prospective, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Three pediatric GI Centers in Houston, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; and Portland, Maine between February 2006 and December 2007. PATIENTS: This study involved children and adolescents consecutively presenting for elective upper endoscopy. Patients with neurodevelopmental and tracheoesophageal disorders were excluded. INTERVENTION: Endoscopic pictures of all cases with suspected BE were independently reviewed and verified by two experienced investigators. Esophageal biopsy specimens were obtained in all patients, and targeted biopsy specimens also were obtained from suspected BE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Endoscopically suspected BE and histologically confirmed BE. RESULTS: A total of 840 patients (mean age 9.5 years) were enrolled and had complete questionnaire and endoscopic data. Twelve patients were suspected of having BE (prevalence of 1.43%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-2.45), and only 1 patient had intestinal metaplasia, for a prevalence of 0.12% (95% CI, 0-0.65), whereas the rest had gastric oxyntic glands (n=6) or squamous esophageal epithelium (n=5). Patients with suspected BE had a higher mean body mass index (23.0 vs 19.1, P=.05) and more chest pain (50% vs 13%, P<.01) than patients without BE or reflux esophagitis. There was a trend toward a higher frequency of dysphagia, heartburn, and regurgitation in patients with suspected BE. LIMITATIONS: The accuracy of BE prevalence estimates is limited by the small number of cases. CONCLUSION: BE is rare in children without neurodevelopmental delay or tracheoesophageal anomalies presenting for elective upper endoscopy.
