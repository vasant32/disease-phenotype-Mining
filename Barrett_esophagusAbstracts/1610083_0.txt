From April 1985 to November 1990, 12 patients with adenocarcinoma in a Barrett's esophagus, all of them men, with a median age of 62 years (range, 46 to 79 years), were operated by transhiatal esophagectomy and were submitted to a periodic follow-up. Dysphagia was the main symptom. Preoperative investigations included esogastroscopy and CT-scan of the abdomen and thorax in all patients. Esophageal endosonography was performed in the last 4 cases and MRI in one case. All patients recovered postoperatively and were discharged from hospital. The resected specimens were staged according to Rosenberg et al.'s classification: stage 1, 3 patients, stage 2, 2 patients, stage 3, 6 patients, stage 4, 1 patient. An anastomotic stricture occurred in 4 patients and was treated successfully by endoscopic dilatation. Five patients died during the follow-up period. Seven patients are alive without evidence of recurrence. Transhiatal esophagectomy appears to be the procedure of choice for adenocarcinoma arising from Barrett's esophagus.
