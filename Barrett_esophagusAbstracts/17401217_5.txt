BACKGROUND: The molecular events that accompany the progression to adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the esophagus are poorly understood. Aberrant mucin receptor expression can contribute to increased cell growth and metastatic ability. AIM: The aim of this study was to establish a pattern for mucin (MUC) gene expression in the esophageal mucosa under normal and pathological conditions. SETTING: University Hospital Cancer Center Laboratory. Archived tissue samples studied in a retrospective fashion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue samples were obtained from the archives of patients with histological evidence of Barrett's esophagus (BE) progressing to ADC. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using mouse monoclonal antibodies for MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6. Semiquantitative scoring of histological staining was performed using a linear scoring system: 0-staining absent; 1-staining in 0-25%; 2-staining in 25-50%; and 3-staining in 50-75% of the epithelium. The Binomial test was used to explore trends and differences in frequency of mucin expression along the pathological sequence. RESULTS: Only mild superficial staining of MUC1 was seen in normal squamous epithelium. MUC1 and MUC2 were uniformly expressed in all samples (7/7) of BE and dysplasia (P=0.008). MUC1 expression was upregulated (7/7) in progression to adenocarcinoma (P=0.008). The secretory mucins, MUC5AC and MUC6 showed a decrease in expression with progression from BE to dysplasia to ADC (P< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of MUC5AC and MUC6 decreases mucosal protection against gastric acid. Increasing MUC1 expression is associated with progression from dysplasia to ADC. Upregulation of MUC2 reflects intestinal metaplasia in BE.
