 BACKGROUND: Prolonged gastro-oesophageal reflux resulting in columnar metaplasia of the oesophagus is the main risk factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma. AIM: To examine the duration of symptoms and associations of different symptoms with the development of columnar-lined oesophagus, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. METHODS: UK multicentre cohort study of patients with columnar-lined oesophagus whose date of symptom onset (1082 patients) and/or types of symptoms reported (1681 patients) were documented. Follow-up was examined by analysis of histological reports from the registering centers. RESULTS: Symptoms of dysphagia/odynophagia and nausea/vomiting were associated with development of dysplasia. High-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma were associated with dysphagia/odynophagia and weight loss. Median duration from symptom onset to detection of columnar-lined oesophagus without intestinal metaplasia: 2.6 years, columnar-lined oesophagus with intestinal metaplasia: 5.0 years, indefinite changes for dysplasia: 19.3 years and low-grade dysplasia: 30.0 years. One tenth of patients had developed high-grade dysplasia at 9.6 years and one tenth had developed adenocarcinoma at 13.8 years from symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with columnar-lined oesophagus, symptoms of dysphagia/odynophagia and nausea/vomiting were associated with a higher risk of development of dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. There is a trend for longer duration of symptoms to the detection of dysplasia.
