Occurrence of C. pylori infection of mucosa outside of the stomach might provide an ideal opportunity to examine C. pylori-mucosal interactions apart from the effects of acid and pepsin. Techniques previously used to examine Barrett's epithelium (for example, special mucin stains or scanning and transmission electron microscopy) might be particularly useful for exploration of new associations and formulation of new hypotheses. Whether C. pylori has a role in development of Barrett's ulcer or adenocarcinoma as a complication of Barrett's esophagus remains unanswered. Most of the current data about C. pylori are primarily observational; further studies are needed for clarification of important microbegut interactions.
