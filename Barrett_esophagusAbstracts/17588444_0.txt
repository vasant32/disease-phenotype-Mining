Cap-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection enables nonsurgical removal of superficial esophageal lesions. Perforation at the resection site is a rare but known complication of this technique. We report a case in which traumatic insertion of the mucosectomy cap led to perforation of the cervical esophagus. This complication has not been previously reported. The perforation was successfully closed by the endoscopic placement of clips.
