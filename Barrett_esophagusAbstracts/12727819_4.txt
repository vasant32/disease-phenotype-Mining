Precancerous epithelial lesions are sites of uncontrolled cellular proliferation, generated by irreversible genetic changes. Not all of these lesions progress to invasive cancer, some may even regress, but early detection of abnormal cells can be crucial for survival of the patient. Diagnosis is mainly performed by using morphological parameters. Proliferation markers can facilitate the analysis, if they show a consistent expression, and distinguish between healthy and malignant cells. The fully human monoclonal IgM antibody PAM-1 was isolated from a patient with stomach carcinoma and binds to a new variant of cysteine-rich fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (CFR-1). This CFR-1/PAM-1 receptor is expressed on nearly all of the epithelial cancers of every type and origin, but not on healthy tissue. It is also present on precursor lesions found in: Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia of the stomach, ulcerative colitis-related dysplasia and adenomas of the colon, Barrett's metaplasia and dysplasia of the esophagus, squamous cell metaplasia and dysplasia of the lung, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The unique, growth-dependent expression of this new CFR-1 isoform makes the PAM-1 antibody an ideal diagnostic tool for the detection of precancerous and cancerous lesions.
