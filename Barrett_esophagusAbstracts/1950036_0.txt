There are two different definitions of Barrett's esophagus, a precancerous condition. The first requires circumferentially lining of the lower esophagus with columnar epithelium, the second adds tongue-like projections extending up into the squamous epithelium more than 2 cm. Carcinomas, which develop in a Barrett's esophagus almost ever are associated with metaplasia of the specialized columnar type. Endoscopic-bioptical examinations of columnar lined projections were done with 26 patients altogether. Histologically 8 patients showed metaplasia of the specialized columnar type. These results show that columnar lined projections of the specialized type are part of Barrett's esophagus.
