From 1973 to 1994, 21 patients with esophageal peptic stenosis were submitted to esophago-jejuno-gastroplasty with Merendino's technique. In 14 cases peptic stenosis developed after Heller's myotomy for achalasia, associated in 3 cases with fundoplication. In 3 patients the stenosis was secondary to fundoplication. Other 3 subjects presented a primary stenosis. One patient showed Barrett's esophagus with in situ carcinoma. Endoscopic esophageal dilatation was attempted in every patient with no satisfactory results. One patient died for a postoperative cardiopulmonary failure (4.7%). One patient developed a fistula of the esophago-jejunal anastomosis treated with enteral nutrition successfully (4.7%). In another subject splenectomy was performed following a iatrogenic injury (4.7%). Minor complications developed in 5 patients (23.7%). After one year from operation in 1 patient a severe stricture of esophago-jejunal anastomosis appeared; it was treated with anastomotic resection and reconstruction. After 8 years one patient was submitted to a partial resection of interposed jejunal loop, that was redundant. In 18 patients long term follow-up showed good results in 14 patients (78%), discrete in 2 (11%), unsatisfactory in 2 (11%). Our results show that Merendino's esophago-jejunal gastroplasty allows to achieve good results with acceptable rate of mortality and morbidity.
