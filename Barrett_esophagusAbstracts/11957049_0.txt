We report a rare case of Barrett's adenocarcinoma asso-ciated with acquired eventration of the diaphragm in a 71-year-old woman. She initially developed dysphagia and epigastric discomfort in May, 1997. On July 9, she was referred to our Department of Surgery at the Ryukyus University Hospital for thorough examination and treatment. Esophageal adenocarcinoma and eventration of the diaphragm were revealed by exhaustive examinations, including chest X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, and proximal gastrectomy with reconstruction of jejunal interposition was performed, on August 8. Histologically, the tumor revealed that the adenocarcinoma arose from short-segment Barrett's esophagus (SSBE). It thus appears that eventration of the diaphragm may induce SSBE and Barrett's adenocarcinoma. We therefore recommend that periodic examinations of the esophagus and stomach be performed in patients with eventration of the diaphragm. Barrett's adenocarcinoma associated with acquired eventration of the diaphragm is reported. Patients with eventration of the diaphragm should undergo periodic examinations of the esophagus and stomach.
