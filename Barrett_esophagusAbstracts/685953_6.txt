Barrett's esophagus was diagnosed in 26 men in a five-year period by demonstrating esophageal specialized columnar epithelium in target biopsies obtained at endoscopy or in peroral suction biopsies of the esophageal mucosa. The clinical, radiologic and manometric features of these patients were reviewed retrospectively. Esophageal lesions associated with this epithelium included distal and midesophageal strictures and ulcers, alone or in combination, or simply esophagitis. One patient had an associated adenocarcinoma. Twenty of 26 (77%) had heartburn or regurgitation, 16 (62%) had easily elicited reflux of barium while supine and 16 of 17 tested had lower esophageal sphincter pressure in the incompetent range. Ninety-six percent had one or more of these parameters positive. This series demonstrates a wide spectrum of esophageal lesions in Barrett's esophagus, and supports the concept that this lesion occurs as a consequence of gastroesophageal reflux and erosive esophagitis. The case of adenocarcinoma in this series adds to the concern that the columnar lined lower esophagus may be a premalignant lesion.
