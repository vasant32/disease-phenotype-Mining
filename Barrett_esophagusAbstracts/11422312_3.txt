In this report, a case is presented of an adenocarcinoma in a Barrett's esophagus metastatic to the choroid. A 54-year-old woman presented with a rapidly progressive decrease of vision in the right eye 8 months after intentionally curative esophagectomy for an adenocarcinoma. Fundoscopy, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging findings were suggestive of a metastasis. The patient received palliative external beam irradiation to the right eye for visual restoration, but she died before any beneficial effect was achieved.
