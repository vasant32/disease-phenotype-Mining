Endoscopic therapy for Barrett's esophagus is feasible and likely to decrease the future risk of development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The most commonly used therapy is radiofrequency ablation, which has been shown to produce reproducible superficial injury in the esophagus. Other thermal therapies include multipolar coagulation, argon plasma coagulation, and thermal laser therapy. The other end of the ablative spectrum includes cryotherapy, which involves freezing tissue to produce mucosal necrosis. Photodynamic therapy has been used to photochemically eliminate abnormal mucosa. Endoscopic therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in high-risk situations such as Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia.
