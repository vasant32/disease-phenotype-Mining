Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) is a naturally occurring polyphosphorylated carbohydrate that is found in food sources high in fiber content. IP6 has been reported to have significant inhibitory effects against a variety of primary tumors. We hypothesized that IP6 would inhibit the cell growth rate of Barrett's adenocarcinoma in vitro. Two Barrett's-associated adenocarcinoma cell lines, SEG-1 and BIC-1, were treated with IP6 at 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mM concentrations. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis and necrosis were evaluated by the Annexin V FITC assay. Reductions (P<0.001) in cellular proliferation were observed in both cell lines. IP6 decreased late apoptosis and necrosis in BIC cells, whereas in SEG-1 cells, early apoptosis, late apoptosis and necrosis were all increased by IP6. IP6 decreases cellular growth by pro-apoptotic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that IP6 has the potential to become an effective adjunct for Barrett's adenocarcinoma. Further studies are needed to evaluate safety and clinical utility of this agent in patients with Barrett's adenocarcinoma.
