Esophageal replacement remains a challenge. Colon and jejunum provide alternative conduits to replace the lower esophagus when stomach is not suitable. Between 1971 and 1991, 41 patients underwent short-segment interposition of the esophagus with jejunum or colon. Indications were failed antireflux procedures (n = 21), nondilatable stricture (n = 9), achalasia (n = 2), moniliasis (n = 2), Barrett's esophagus with carcinoma in situ (n = 2), hemorrhagic esophagitis after esophagogastrectomy (n = 1), motility disorder (n = 1), instrumental perforation (n = 1), carcinoma (n = 1), and leiomyosarcoma (n = 1). Thirty-one patients (75.6%) had prior surgical procedures. Interposition with colon was performed in 22 patients and with jejunum in 19. Major complications occurred in 45% after colon interposition (10/22) and hospital mortality was 4.5% (1/22). Major complications after jejunal interposition occurred in 31% (6/19) and hospital mortality was 10.5% (2/19). A contained anastomotic leak occurred in 1 patient, perforation of a colon segment in 1, and jejunal graft necrosis in a third. Late functional results in 34 patients with a mean follow-up of 87 months were excellent or good in 26, fair in 5, and poor in 1. Colon interposition failed to improve symptoms in 2 patients with gastrointestinal motility disorders. Six patients underwent manometry and barium food provocation study. Two colon segments and 3 jejunal interpositions were hypoperistaltic or aperistaltic according to manometry. There was 1 case of aperistaltic jejunum with a distended afferent loop. When stomach is not available, successful palliation of swallowing can be accomplished with either jejunum or colon. Surgeons involved in the management of esophageal disease should be familiar with the technical details of both procedures.
