 OBJECTIVES: Bile acids and acid are implicated in the development of Barrett's esophagus. Evidence suggests that Barrett's esophagus intestinal metaplasia may occur via induction of caudal homeobox gene 2 (CDX2). We hypothesized that induction of CDX2 by bile acids may be due to ligand-dependent transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). METHODS: Human mucosal epithelial cells (SEG-1) were treated for 0 to 24 h with up to 300 microM deoxycholic acid (DCA) at pH 7 or 5 with or without (w/wo) antibodies against EGFR ligand-binding site (Mab528, 3-5 mug/ml). Treatment with 100 ng/ml EGF served as control. CDX2 mRNA expression was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. EGFR activation was analyzed by Westerns of phosphorylated EGFR tyrosines. RESULTS: Acid (pH 5) increased the induction of CDX2 mRNA expression caused by DCA. CDX2 mRNA induction was markedly reduced by EGFR blockade with Mab528. Each treatment (pH 5, DCA or pH 5 plus DCA) activated the EGFR on all tyrosines tested but in different time courses. Phosphorylation by DCA was inhibited by Mab528. Activation of EGFR by DCA at pH 5 resulted in EGFR degradation, while that by DCA alone did not. CONCLUSION: Thus, CDX2 induction by DCA w/wo acid occurs through ligand-dependent transactivation of the EGFR. The variations in EGFR degradation pattern with DCA or DCA at pH 5 indicate differential transactivation pathways. The molecular pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus may occur via bile-stimulated cell signaling through the EGFR.
