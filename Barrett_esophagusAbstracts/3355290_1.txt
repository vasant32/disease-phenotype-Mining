A benign tracheoesophageal fistula occurring as a complication of Barrett's ulcerative esophagitis is described. Surgical control of gastroesophageal reflux resulted in healing of the fistula, obviating the need for a resective procedure or esophageal exclusion. Although Barrett's ulcer has been reported as a cause of acquired esophagorespiratory fistula, to our knowledge, the important role of reflux control in the management of this difficult problem has not been discussed.
