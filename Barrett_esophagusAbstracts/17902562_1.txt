OBJECTIVE: To gain more insight into current surveillance and treatment of patients with Barrett's oesophagus with the aim of developing new guidelines. DESIGN: Questionnaire. METHOD: In 2004, a questionnaire was sent to 337 physician-endoscopists who were all registered with the Netherlands Society of Gastroenterology. The questionnaire inventoried various aspects of surveillance and treatment of patients with Barrett's oesophagus. RESULTS: Of the 289 respondents (86%), 96% carried out surveillance or had it carried out, on at least a proportion of their patients with Barrett's oesophagus. A total of 258 respondents (89%) carried out the surveillance themselves. An endoscopic indication of the presence of Barrett's oesophagus was, for 31% of the respondents, enough reason to carry out surveillance of this condition irrespective of the results of pathological investigations. 75% applied an age limit for surveillance for Barrett's. The median age limit is 75 years (interquartile distance: 70-75) and 46% of the treating professionals limited themselves to patients who, on the basis of age and co-morbidity, may undergo oesophageal resection. The choice of treatment in early neoplasia, surgical or endoscopic, depends not only on the histological diagnosis, but also on the age and the co-morbidities of the patient. CONCLUSION: Surveillance of Barrett's oesophagus is widespread in the Netherlands, and in general is carried out in accordance with international guidelines. The possibilities of treating patients with high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma of the oesophagus endoscopically, and of consulting external advisory bodies are still insufficiently utilized.
