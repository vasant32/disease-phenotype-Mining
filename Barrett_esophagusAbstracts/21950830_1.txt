The following on molecular mechanisms of Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma contains commentaries on the mechanism of bile and gastric acid induced damage; the roles of BMP-4 and CDX-2 in the development of intestinal metaplasia; the transcription factors driving intestinalization in Barrett's esophagus; the contribution of bone marrow to metaplasia and adenocarcinoma; activation and inactivation of transcription factors; and a novel study design targeting molecular pathways in Barrett's esophagus.
