BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or early neoplasia increasingly receive endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy. We analyzed data from a UK registry that follows outcomes of patients with BE who have undergone RFA for neoplasia. METHODS: We collected data on 335 patients with BE and neoplasia (72% with HGD, 24% with intramucosal cancer, 4% with low-grade dysplasia (mean age, 69 y; 81% male), treated at 19 centers in the UK from July 2008 through August 2012. The mean length of BE segments was 5.8 cm (range, 1-20 cm). Patients' nodules were removed by EMR, and the patients then underwent RFA every 3 months until all areas of BE were ablated or cancer developed. Biopsies were collected 12 months after the first RFA; clearance of HGD (CR-HGD), dysplasia (CR-D), and BE (CR-BE) were assessed. RESULTS: HGD was cleared from 86% of patients, all dysplasia from 81%, and BE from 62% at the 12-month time point, following a mean 2.5 RFA procedures (range 2-6). CR-D was 15% less likely for every 1 cm increment in BE length (odds ratio, 1.156; standard error, 0.048; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.26; P<.001). EMR before RFA did not provide any benefit. Ten patients (3%) had developed invasive cancer by the 12-month time point, and disease had progressed in 17 patients (5.1%) after a median follow-up time of 19 months. Symptomatic strictures developed in 9% of patients, which were treated by endoscopic dilatation. Nineteen months after therapy began, 94% of patients remain clear of dysplasia. CONCLUSION: We analyzed data from a large series of patients in the UK who underwent RFA for BE-related neoplasia, and found that by 12 months after treatment, dysplasia was cleared from 81%. Shorter segments BE respond better to RFA.
