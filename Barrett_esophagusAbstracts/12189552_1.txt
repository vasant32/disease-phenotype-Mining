The potential of the metal-binding protein, metallothionein, in assessing the progression of normal oesophagus through Barrett's to adenocarcinoma was investigated. Metallothionein was quantitatively determined in resected tissues from patients undergoing oesophagectomy for high grade dysplasia/adenocarcinoma and in biopsies from patients with Barrett's syndrome. In 10 cancer patients, metallothionein concentrations in adenocarcinoma were not significantly different from normal oesophagus, although six had elevated metallothionein concentrations in the metaplastic tissue bordering the adenocarcinoma. In 17 out of 20 non-cancer patients with Barrett's epithelium, metallothionein was significantly increased by 108% (P<0.004). There was no association between the metallothionein levels in Barrett's epithelium and the presence of inflammatory cells, metaplasia or dysplasia. Metallothionein is a marker of progression from normal to Barrett's epithelium but is not increased in oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
