Congenital esophageal duplications represent about 15% of digestive tract duplications. We report a 38-year-old man who presented with longstanding heartburn and recent dysphagia. Endoscopy showed communicating tubular duplication of lower esophagus with ulceroproliferative growth at the gastric cardia extending into the lower esophagus. Histology of radical esophagogastrectomy specimen showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of gastric cardia without evidence of Barrett's esophagus.
