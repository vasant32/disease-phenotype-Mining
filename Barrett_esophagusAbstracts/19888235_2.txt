Endoscopic treatment of early Barrett's neoplasia can now be regarded as the treatment of choice in high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and mucosal adenocarcinoma occurring in Barrett's esophagus. Endoscopic resection (ER) is one of the best-validated treatment methods and has the major advantage of serving as a diagnostic and therapeutic treatment toward thermal ablative methods. Complete resection of the whole Barrett's segment is one method for treatment of the neoplastic lesion and the remaining Barrett's mucosa at risk. This article discusses both the advantages and disadvantages of this method and its alternatives.
