Focal lymphoid hyperplasia is an uncommon but ubiquitous lesion. It occurs most commonly in the gastrointestinal tract in association with chronic peptic ulcer disease of the stomach. We describe the hitherto unrecognized association of lymphoid hyperplasia in the esophagus with chronic stenosing ulcerating esophagitis and Barrett's mucosa. This association is considered to be analogous to the more prevalent coexistence of lymphoid hyperplasia and chronic peptic ulcer disease in the stomach.
