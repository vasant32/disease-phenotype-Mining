 BACKGROUND: The role of H. pylori infection in GERD is highly controversial. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between reflux esophagitis and H. pylori infection in Jordanian subjects and to examine the gastric site for H. pylori that is most strongly associated with reflux esophagitis. METHODS: During endoscopy two biopsies from the cardia and another two biopsies from the antrum were taken from 100 consecutive patients with reflux esophagitis (RE group) and from a sex- and age-matched group of 50 patients, who were referred to the endoscopy unit for evaluation of upper gastrointestinal symptoms and whose endoscopic findings were normal (control group). The biopsies were examined histologically for the presence of gastritis and H. pylori. RESULTS: Antral histological gastritis, Barrett's esophagus and hiatus hernia were significantly more common in the RE group than in the control group. Out of the 100 patients, 68 (68%) in the RE group and 26 of 50 (52%) in the control group were found to have H. pylori infection. The presence of H. pylori in both antral and cardiac biopsies was significantly more frequent in patients of the RE group. Forty-four patients in the RE group had positive H. pylori in both antral and cardiac biopsies (44%), while only 12 out of 50 patients of the control group (24%) had positive H. pylori in both biopsies. In the control group the prevalence of H. pylori in the antrum was similar to that of patients of the RE group (52% vs. 59%), but colonization of H. pylori in the cardia was significantly much lower than that of the RE group (24% vs. 53%; P = 0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: The increased prevalence of H. pylori colonization in the cardia is associated with reflux esophagitis and further controlled clinical study is required to show the impact of H. pylori eradication in patients with reflux esophagitis.
