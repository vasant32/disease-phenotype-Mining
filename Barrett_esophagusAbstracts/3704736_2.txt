We have described three patients with heterotopic gastric mucosa of the proximal esophagus, which has been recognized by pathologists since the early 19th century. In contrast to Barrett's esophagus, which is now known as an acquired metaplastic lesion of the esophagus, this mucosa is believed to be a remnant of incomplete epithelialization of the esophagus during fetal life. It has little clinical significance because of the small size of the mucosal patch and the neutralization of the acid by saliva.
