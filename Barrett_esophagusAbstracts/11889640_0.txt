By means of a case report classification, etiology and pathogenesis of benign esophageal strictures are discussed. In the presented case an endobrachyesophagus with peptic stricture of the middle third of the esophagus was found. The most common conservative treatment consists of esophageal bouginage combined with long-term medication of proton pump inhibitors as was also done in this case. Depending on the physical status of the patient surgical treatment is given if repeated bouginage of the stricture during at least 3 months becomes necessary. Resection of the stricture or antireflux surgery in combination with bouginage of the stricture are current surgical options.
