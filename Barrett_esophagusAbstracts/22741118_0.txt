The practice for endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's oesophagus has evolved from "blind" or random 4 quadrant biopsies (Seattle protocol) to a more "intelligent" targeted biopsy approach. This evolution has been possible due to the rapid advances in endoscopic imaging technology and expertise in the last decade. Previous endoscopes had relatively poor image resolution that often did not allow the subtle mucosal changes associated with dysplastic Barrett's mucosa to be identified. Newer endoscopic imaging techniques available today may allow endoscopists to identify areas of dysplasia or malignancy and target biopsies accordingly. These modalities which include narrow band imaging, chromoendoscopy, autofluorescence imaging, and confocal endomicroscopy as well as a few novel imaging modalities on the horizon will be discussed further.
