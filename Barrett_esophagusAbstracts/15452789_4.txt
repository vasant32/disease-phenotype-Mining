Recent reports on the results of endoscopic ablation of Barrett's mucosa have been promising, particularly when total mucosal ablation is coupled with aggressive acid-suppression treatment using high-dose proton-pump inhibitor therapy. There is also a considerable literature on reepithelialization after ablative treatments in Barrett's esophagus. This report describes a case of multifocal superficial adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's mucosa that was successfully treated with total circumferential endoscopic mucosal resection, with a subsequent follow-up of more than 2 years. This is the first report describing the process of squamous reepithelialization after endoscopic mucosal resection in Barrett's esophagus.
