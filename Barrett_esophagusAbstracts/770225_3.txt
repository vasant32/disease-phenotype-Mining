Four cases of Barrett's esophagus are presented. Three cases presented with significant esophageal bleeding and one case presented with high esophageal stricture. Gastrointestinal panendoscopy was done in each case and multiple biopsies were taken. The biopsies were utilized for histomorphology, pepsinogen agar gel electrophoresis, and tissue gastrin assays. Tissue gastrin levels in esophageal mucosa were elevated in 2 cases when compared to controls with and without hiatus hernia. Pepsin and acid secretory studies were done by isolating the esophagus. Barrett's esophagus was shown to produce pepsin by both chemical studies (2 cases) and agar gel electrophoresis at pH 5.7 (3 cases), and was also shown to produce acid. The mucosa contained either cathepsin or cathepsin and pepsinogens in all cases. Nissen's fundoplication was performed in all of the patients. Of 3 patients who were bleeding, 2 who consented for this operation stopped bleeding after the operation. It is to be noted that the usual clinical treatment of antacids, bedrest, and raising the head end of the bed failed in all of the patients. The follow-up of 9 months to 3 years postoperatively has shown persistence of Barrett's mucosa with no evidence for any reversion to normal esophageal type.
