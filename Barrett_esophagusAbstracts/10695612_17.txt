A novel monoclonal antibody (MAbDAS-1), that specifically reacts with colonic but not small intestinal epithelium, recognizes specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) in the esophagus. The frequency of its reactivity in biopsy specimens of patients with endoscopically suspected Barrett's Esophagus (BE) is examined. Fifty-two biopsy specimens of the distal esophagus from 38 patients were tested by immunoperoxidase method using MAbDAS-1. Fifty-four samples of cardia-type mucosa biopsied from the stomach were used as controls. Results were compared with histology and Alcian blue/high iron diamine (AB/HID). Of the 52 specimens, 29 had glandular epithelium and the rest had only squamous epithelium. Ten were diagnosed to have SCE by histology. All 10 samples reacted with MAbDAS-1 and with Alcian blue. Of the remaining 19 specimens, five also reacted with MAbDAS-1. None of the squamous epithelium and cardia specimens reacted with MAbDAS-1. MAbDAS-1 may detect intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus of colonic phenotype in the absence of histological evidence of SCE.
