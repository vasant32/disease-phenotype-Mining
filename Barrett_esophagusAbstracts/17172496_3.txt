Carcinomas involving the gastroesophageal junction are common in China. The histopathologic characteristics of these cancers have not been systematically investigated. Reported are 41 such resected cancers from Chinese patients (30 men, 11 women). Their mean age was 62 years. The mean tumor size was 4.4 cm (range, 2 to 9 cm), and 58% were poorly differentiated. An unusual spectrum of tumor differentiation was observed, including adenocarcinomas (83%), adenosquamous (32%), colloid (2%), signet-ring (10%), squamous (5%), oncocytic (7%), pancreatic acinar (12%), and neuroendocrine (5%) carcinomas. Cancers with multiple types of differentiation in the same tumor were identified in 37 cases (90%). The adjacent gastric cardiac mucosa showed hyperplasia, oncocytic, and pancreatic acinar metaplasia, and mild chronic inflammation. Dysplasia was uncommon (n = 6). Barrett esophagus was not identified. Carcinomas involving the gastroesophageal junction in the Chinese are morphologically distinct, heterogeneous, and may be of esophageal origin.
