Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by inflammatory cells can contribute to tissue destruction. ROS have been implicated in various gastrointestinal abnormalities, including the acid related peptic diseases. Although the development of oesophagitis and Barrett's columnar epithelium is associated with prolonged reflux of gastric acid, the exact mechanism by which tissue damage occurs is not known. To discover if ROS are involved in damage to the oesophageal mucosa, this study measured in vitro the mucosal ROS concentrations of biopsied mucosal samples taken from patients with reflux oesophagitis using luminol enhanced chemiluminescence (LECL). Mucosal biopsy specimens were taken from 83 patients: 19 with normal oesophageal mucosa (group I); 20 with macroscopic oesophagitis (group II); 20 with biopsy confirmed Barrett's epithelium without macroscopic oesophagitis (group III); and 24 with Barrett's epithelium with macroscopic oesophagitis (group IV). The mucosa from patients exhibited significantly higher LECL values than the mucosa from controls. But, there were no significant differences between groups II, III, and IV. Addition of the myeloperoxidase inhibitor, azide, or the hydrogen peroxide scavenger, catalase, to the tissue suspension caused a decrease in LECL values of 32% and 45%, respectively, suggesting that neutrophils--although important--are not the only source of mucosal LECL. These data are consistent with the proposal that ROS play an important part in the tissue injury associated with oesophagitis and Barrett's columnar epithelium.
