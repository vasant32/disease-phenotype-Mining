 UNLABELLED: Barrett's esophagus is the proved stage of increasing risk for development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Why among wide spread GERD, a few patients only develop Barrett's esophagus is still not clear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To define the factors, which significantly increase the risk for development Barrett's esophagus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 36 patients hospitalized in the years 2005-2007 in the Department of Digestive Tract Diseases, Medical University in Lódź, with diagnosed Barrett's esophagus (based on gastroscopy with biopsy and histopathologic findings). For the analysis, two control groups of healthy subjects were chosen: I--35 patients (mean age 54.3 years) with normal gastroscopy, II--40 patients (mean age 54.2 years) who had not undergone gastroscopy Risk factors were evaluated according to the self-elaborated, filled-in questionnaire. The following risk factors were taken into consideration: age, sex, BMI, stimulants (cigarettes, alcohol and coffee), diet, eating habits (preferred food, fruit and vegetables consumption, regularity and quantity of meals), physical activity, heartburn sensation, swallowing disorders, nausea, other diseases and family history. RESULTS: Mean age of patients with diagnosed Barrett's esophagus was 55.9 +/- 11.2 years; in men: 55.7 +/- 12.2 and in women: 56.3 +/- 9.2. In the analyzed group there were 25 men (69.4%) and 11 women (30.6%), the man/woman ratio was 2.3:1. In the group with diagnosed Barrett's esophagus the heartburn sensation was observed in 30 (83.3%) patients, overweight and obesity (BMI >25 kg/m2) in 22 (61.1%) patients, 16 (44.4%) patients smoked cigarettes, 11 (30.6%) had swallowing problems, 12 (33.3%) suffered from nausea. Factors and symptoms, mentioned above have been significantly more often observed, as compared to I and/or II control group (p < or = 0.05). Statistical significance for other analyzed factors was not reached (significance value p < or = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Barrett's esophagus is associated with: male sex, overweight and obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m2), cigarette smoking, heartburn sensation, swallowing disorders and nausea.
