Gastrointestinal adenomas are neoplasms of glandular epithelium containing dysplasia of varying degrees. They are rare in esophagus. A case of villous tumor of the esophagus in a 71-year-old man is described. Histologically, this polypoid, villous lesion was developed on Barrett's esophagus and contained dysplastic epithelium and small adenocarcinomatous foci. This case illustrates that esophagus adenoma may be a premalignant lesion like other adenomas of the gastrointestinal tract. The term of polypoid dysplasia has therefore been recommended. This lesion, usually developed in gastric heterotopy or Barrett's esophagus, is often associated with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma.
