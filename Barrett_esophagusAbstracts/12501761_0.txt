 BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the gastroesophageal reflux is a predisposing factor for the development of asthmatic attacks. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux in pediatric patients with asthma of the Service of Allergy and Immunology at the Hospital Regional Lic. Adolfo LÃ³pez Mateos. MATERIAL AND METHODS: It was made an observational study from July 2000 to July 2001. Gastroesophageal gammagraphic and endoscopy (with taking of esophageal biopsy) were carried out to each of the patients in order to find out if there was gastroesophageal reflux. RESULTS: 112 patients with moderate persistent asthma (54 women and 58 men) were included and divided in three different age groups (group I, from 1 to 5 years old; group II, from 6 to 10 and III, from 11 to 16 years old). The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux was 138, 100 and 93, respectively, being specially high in males. Differences in the prevalence among different groups were statistically significant between group I and II (p < 0.001) and between I and III (p < 0.001). Significant changes were not observed between group II and III (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux the structured was high, situation directly related with the diagnostic suspicion in our asthmatic population.
