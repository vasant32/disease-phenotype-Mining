Few reports exist detailing results of multimodality treatment for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. We have treated 28 such patients using a preoperative regimen consisting of two courses of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil with radiation (either 3,000 or 3,600 cGy). There were 25 men and 3 women (mean age, 62.9 years; range, 35 to 86 years), and 16 patients were known to have Barrett's esophagus. Dysphagia was present for a mean of 2.7 months, and the average weight loss was 6.5 kg. Tumors ranged from 2 to 10 cm in length (mean, 5.2 +/- 1.8 cm) with American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical stage I in 2 patients, stage II in 19 patients, and stage III in 7. Dysphagia improved in 23 patients (82%), and in 8 (29%) no tumor was detected during radiologic and endoscopic staging after neoadjuvant therapy. Four patients refused operation. Esophagectomy via standard Ivor Lewis approach was accomplished in 20 of 24 patients (87%) undergoing operation. There were no operative deaths, and mean hospital stay was 15.5 +/- 11.6 days. Four patients (17%) were complete responders with no tumor in the resected specimen. Actuarial survival in the 28 patients at 1, 2, and 3 years is 71%, 28%, and 20% respectively. Of the 20 esophagectomy patients, 6 are alive with no evidence of disease at 10, 50, 54, 70, 77, and 84 months. Three of these were complete responders. Only 1 of the 8 patients no undergoing resection is alive at 16 months with no evidence of disease after further radiotherapy and chemotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
