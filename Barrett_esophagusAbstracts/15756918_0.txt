Laparoscopic fundoplication became the gold standard in the surgical therapy of GERD. In comparison with open procedures, laparoscopic antireflux surgery has a lower morbidity rate, a better early and late postoperative outcome and is more cost-effective. Antireflux surgery can be performed after a critical evalutation of the patient including gastroscopy, biopsy, 24h-pH-manometry and after a long lasting conservative medical treatment. Indications for antireflux surgery are given by a failed medical treatment, an insufficient compliance, complications of GERD, i.e. stenosis, Barrett-esophagus and atypical reflux symptoms like chronic cough, hoarseness or thoracic pain with presence of a pathological pH-monitoring. Laparoscopic 360 degrees Nissen-fundoplication with crurorrhaphy is our standard procedure, whereas the 270 degrees Toupet technique in our tailored approach is the technique of choice for esophageal motility disorders. Results of antireflux surgery published in literature are discussed and compared with our own ten years experience with 124 cases of laparoscopic fundoplication.
