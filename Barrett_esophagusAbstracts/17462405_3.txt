 BACKGROUND: The morphologic and immunohistochemical profiles of gastric mucosa and of the tumor were assessed in Siewert type I, type II, and gastric antrum adenocarcinomas. METHODS: Sixty-two patients, prospectively operated upon, were included in the study: 37 type II, 15 type I, and 10 antrum adenocarcinoma. Samples of the tumor, the surrounding area, and the gastric corpus and antrum were analyzed histologically, and immunostained for cytokeratins (CK)7/20 (staining positive for cells labeled > or = 50%). RESULTS: Among the 37 type II adenocarcinomas were the following: (1) 13 of 37 (35%) had intestinal metaplasia (IM) in the stomach; (2) 24 of 37 (65%) did not show IM at any level; (3) 34 of 37 (92%) had Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection; (4) 13 of 37(35%) had CK7/20 expression of "Barrett's type" (CK7+/20-); 24 of 37 (65%) had a "no Barrett's type" profile (10 of 37 with CK7-/CK20+ and 14 of 37 with CK7+/CK20+); (5) 100% showed the same CK immunoprofile, both in IM and adenocarcinoma (measure of agreement k = 1, p = 0.000). Type I adenocarcinomas showed the following: (1) 87.5% CK Barrett's type, both in the tumor, and in the surrounding IM; (2) 100% gastric samples devoid of both IM and HP infection. Comparison between CK immunoprofiles in type I and type II tumors showed a difference within the two groups (p = 0.002). One hundred percent of antrum adenocarcinomas showed a no Barrett's type CK profile, both in the tumor and in the IM of the entire stomach. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that type II adenocarcinoma cannot be always considered a gastroesophageal reflux disease-related tumor; other pathogenetic pathways should be taken into consideration.
