During a routine health examination, a 50-year-old man was found to have an elevated lesion at the esophagogastric junction. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was diagnosed from the biopsy findings. Computed tomography showed metastases in the mediastinal, intra-abdominal, and paraaortic lymph nodes. The clinical stage diagnosis was cT2, cN4, cM0, cStage IVa. Combination chemotherapy with docetaxel, CDDP, and 5-FU (DCF) was started initially. After 2 courses of DCF, the primary lesion and mediastinal lymph nodes had decreased in size, but the intra-abdominal lymph node had grown. A curative operation with paraaortic lymph node dissection was considered possible; thus, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery of the esophagus with 3-field lymph node dissection was performed. The final findings revealed Barrett's esophageal carcinoma, EG, 0-III,23Ã—18 mm, mod-por, CT-pT1b (sm3) pN4, sM0, fStage IV. Histologically, the mediastinal lymph node metastases disappeared with chemotherapy, but no reduction was observed in the abdominal lymph nodes. After surgery, 2 courses of combination adjuvant chemotherapy with CDDP and 5-FU were administered along with 50 Gy of radiotherapy. Subsequently, the treatment was changed to tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium alone on an outpatient basis. The patient remains recurrence free 22 months postsurgery.
