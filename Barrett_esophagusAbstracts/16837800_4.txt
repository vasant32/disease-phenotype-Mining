 BACKGROUND: The incidence of esophageal cancer is markedly increased in patients with head and neck cancer, and the presence of esophageal cancer is associated with reduced survival rates. AIMS: We investigated whether the results of screening for esophageal cancer in patients with head and neck cancer using chromoendoscopy would change the treatment of such patients. PATIENTS: 87 patients with head and neck cancer and known alcohol or nicotine abuse were screened for esophageal cancer. Methods: The patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and staining of the esophagus with 2% Lugol's solution. Biopsies were taken from unstained areas for histopathological assessment. RESULTS: Esophageal cancer was newly diagnosed in 10 patients (11.5%), including 2 with carcinoma in situ. There were dysplastic changes in 6 patients (7%) and an unknown Barrett esophagus in 4 patients (5%). In 36 patients (41%) unstained areas were associated with esophagitis. While unstained areas could not be detected in 17 patients, the histology was normal in 14 patients with unstained areas. In all the patients with newly detected invasive esophageal cancer, the treatment had to be changed from a curative neoadjuvant approach to palliative treatment. In 2 patients with carcinoma in situ mucosectomy was performed. In the cases with dysplastic areas and newly detected Barrett epithelium a careful follow-up regime was arranged. CONCLUSIONS: The staging of patients with head and neck cancer, and the risk factors for esophageal cancer should include chromoendoscopy of the esophagus as a standard procedure. Extended staging provides critical additional information, which helps to more safely distinguish future candidates for curative and palliative treatment.
