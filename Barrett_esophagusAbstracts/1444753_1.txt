Six cases of known Barrett's esophagus were examined immunohistochemically for the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor. All cases showed expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in intestinal metaplastic Barrett's epithelium, the most common form of Barrett's change. Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor may be important in neoplastic transformation in Barrett's esophagus, possibly by an autocrine mechanism. Alternatively, epidermal growth factor receptor expression in intestinal metaplastic Barrett's epithelium may represent a nonneoplastic regenerative phenomenon as seen at other sites within the gastrointestinal tract. Further larger studies are required to assess the clinical significance of these findings.
