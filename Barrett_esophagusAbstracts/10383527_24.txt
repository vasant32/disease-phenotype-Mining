BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori exaggerates the effect of acid suppressive drugs on intragastric pH. It is unknown whether this is relevant for the treatment of GERD. AIM: To compare oesophageal acid exposure and symptoms in H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive GERD patients during low and profound acid suppression. METHODS: Barrett's oesophagus patients with gastro- oesophageal acid reflux were studied by 24-h oesophageal pH-metry at baseline and during randomized treatment with omeprazole 40 mg b.d. or ranitidine 150 mg b.d. H. pylori status was determined by a serum IgG ELISA. Symptoms were scored on a four-graded scale. RESULTS: Of 58 patients, 26 (14 H. pylori-negative, 12 H. pylori-positive) were randomized to omeprazole, 32 (16 H. pylori-negative, 16 H. pylori-positive) to ranitidine. At baseline, oesophageal acid exposure and symptoms did not differ between H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive: mean time proportion pH < 4 per 24 h was 16.1% (95% CI 11.5-23.2) in H. pylori-negative, and 15.8% (11.3-21.4) in H. pylori-positive patients. Omeprazole treatment resulted in a decrease of acid reflux per 24 h from 23.4% (7.9-39.3) to 0.0% (0.0-2.9) in H. pylori-negative, and from 17.3% (8.9-38.8) to 0.1% (0.0-1.7) in H. pylori-positive patients; ranitidine resulted in a decrease from 14.4% (10.5-18.5) to 9.3% (5.6-12.8) in H. pylori-negative, and from 15.1% (9.8-21.0) to 9.0% (3.1-20.1) in H. pylori-positive patients, the difference between H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive patients being N.S. There was no significant difference between H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive patients with respect to erect and supine acid reflux, or symptom scores in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection does not influence oesophageal acid reflux and symptoms in patients with Barrett's oesophagus, either at baseline or during low as well as profound acid suppressive therapy. We conclude that the dose of acid suppression does not have to be titrated upon H. pylori status in GERD.
