The purpose of this study was to determine the angiogenic profile of human oesophageal adenocarcinoma. This study was carried out on a large series of surgically resected Barrett's adenocarcinomas and associated preneoplastic lesions. Vascularization was quantified by microvessel counting and measurement of the percentage microvessel surface area after immunohistochemistry using the CD34 antibody. The expression of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) was also examined by immunohistochemistry. Results were correlated with clinico-pathological data and prognosis. Vascularization, assessed by both microvessel counting and measurement of the microvessel surface, was statistically higher in superficial cancers than in others. Higher vascularization was correlated with a lower rate of lymph node and distant metastasis, as well as with better survival. However, when superficial carcinomas were excluded from the study, microvessel count failed to provide any significant prognostic information. Irrespective of the inclusion or exclusion of superficial tumours, the expression of VEGF was correlated with a higher vascularisation but did not provide prognostic significance. It is concluded that high angiogenic properties are acquired in precancerous lesions and early cancers in Barrett's oesophagus. Vascularization as assessed by both microvessel counting and measurement of the microvessel surface is not informative for prognosis in infiltrative Barrett's adenocarcinomas. The expression of VEGF is correlated with vascularization, but has no independent prognostic relevance.
