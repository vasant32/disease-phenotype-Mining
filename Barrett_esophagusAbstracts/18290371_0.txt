Biopsy and surgery specimens taken from 224 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease were clinically and morphologically analyzed. The morphological diagnosis of this condition is of more informative value than endoscopy and X-ray study. Malignization occurs in 25% of patients with Barrett oesophagus. One case of surgical treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease yielding a good outcome is described.
