 AIM: To evaluate prospectively the accuracy of preoperative high-frequency (20 MHz) probe ultrasonography (HFPUS) for detecting invasive cancer in patients referred for esophagectomy because of an endoscopic biopsy diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or intramucosal carcinoma (ICA) in Barrett's esophagus (BE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine consecutive male patients (median age of 69 yr) who were referred for esophagectomy for HGD or ICA in BE agreed to participate. We performed conventional upper gastrointestinal endoscopy followed by HFPUS using a through-the-scope ultrasound probe (20 MHz), and we compared our preoperative findings with the pathologist's findings in the resected esophageal specimens. RESULTS: There was complete agreement between the postoperative pathological findings and the preoperative HFPUS findings in only 4 of the 9 patients. HFPUS resulted in two false-negative diagnoses of esophageal cancer (both had T1 lesions in the resected specimens), one false-positive diagnosis of esophageal cancer, and two errors in tumor staging (1 understaged, 1 overstaged). CONCLUSIONS: HFPUS has limited accuracy for identifying invasive cancer in patients found to have HGD or IMC in BE. Pending further refinements in technology, clinical management decisions in such patients should not be based solely on the results of HFPUS.
