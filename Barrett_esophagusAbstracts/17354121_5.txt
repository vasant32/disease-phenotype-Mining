 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate a new high-power argon plasma coagulation system (hp-APC) in therapeutic gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From February to June 2005, 216 patients (167 M (77.3%), mean age 66 years) underwent treatment with hp-APC in a total of 275 sessions. Main indications were additive ablation therapy in Barrett's esophagus, palliative treatment of esophageal cancer, gastric polyps/carcinomas, angiodysplasias, Zenker's diverticula, and duodenal adenomas. The new hp-APC device (VIO 300 D with APC 2) was used (15-120 W) in upper GI endoscopy, push-enteroscopy, and double-balloon enteroscopy. RESULTS: The mean number of treatment sessions required was 1.7 (1-5). For palliative tumor ablation in the esophagus, the number of sessions was 2.3 (1-5). Minor complications (pain, dysphagia, neuromuscular irritation, asymptomatic gas accumulation in the intestinal wall) were observed in 29/216 patients (13.4%). Major complications (perforation, stenosis occurred) in 2 patients (0.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Hp-APC appears to be safe and effective in the treatment of various GI condition using different types of endoscopes including double-balloon enteroscopy. Because of the low number of treatment sessions required, hp-APC could be used as an alternative to Nd:YAG laser treatment in tumor debulking.
