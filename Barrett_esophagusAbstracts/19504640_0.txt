 OBJECTIVE: To establish animal models of reflux esophagitis in rats. METHODS: Seventy male Sprague Dawley rats aged 8 weeks were randomly divided into 4 groups: in Group A (n=20) esophagojejunostomy was performed to induce a gastro-jejuno-esophageal reflux; in Group B (n=20) esophagoduodenostomy was performed to induce a gastro-duodeno-esophageal reflux; in Group C (n=20) total gastrectomy plus esophagojejunostomy was performed to induce a jejuno-esophageal reflux; in Group D (n=10) only was performed sham operation (control). RESULT: Among 70 rats, 6 died in Group A, 7 died in Group B, 6 died in Group C, and 72.9 %(51/70) animals were completed in the study. After 12 weeks the incidence of esophageal inflammation was 100.0%; in Groups A, B and C erosion occurred in 11/14 (78.6%), 10/13 (76.9%), 3/14 (21.4%) of animals, respectively; squamous dysplasia was in 10/14 (71.4%), 10/13 (76.9%), 5/14 (35.7%) of rats, respectively; Barrett's esophagus was in 6/14 (42.9%), 5/13 (38.5%), 1/14 (7.1%), respectively. One esophageal adenocarcinoma was found in Group A; no histological changes were observed in Group D. Conclusion: The animal models of reflux esophagitis can be induced by esophagojejunostomy, esophagoduodenostomy or total gastrectomy plus esophago-jejunostomy in rats; and the former two surgical modalities are better than the later.
