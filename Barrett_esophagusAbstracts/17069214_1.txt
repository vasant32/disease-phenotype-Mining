Barrett esophagus is a rare medical entity. We present the case of a 56 years female patient admitted in our clinic for surgical treatment of a complication of a rigid stenosis of the lower esophagus. The situation is particular by the presence of two digestive strictures due to the same cause: gastric acid aggression. The steps of therapy of Barrett esophagus are reviewed, as well as the surgical options for choosing the best digestive segment able to replace the resected esophagus. The excellent immediate and long-term postoperative evolution allow us to believe that the surgical solution we used was the most appropriate and that the resected stomach can be successfully employed as a substitute for the esophagus after the resection of its lower half.
