 AIM: To evaluate the relationship of Helicobacter pylori infection to reflux esophagitis (RE), Barrett's esophagus (BE) and gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM). METHODS: RE, BE and gastric IM were determined by upper endoscopy. Patients were divided into 2 groups; those with squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) beyond gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) > =3 cm (group A), and those with SCJ beyond GEJ <3 cm (group B). Biopsy specimens were obtained endoscopically from just below the SCJ, gastric antrum along the greater and lesser curvature. Pathological changes and H pylori infection were determined by HE staining, Alcian blue staining and Giemsa staining. RESULTS: The prevalence of H pylori infection was 46.93%. There was no difference in the prevalence between males and females. The prevalence of H pylori infection decreased stepwise significantly from RE grade I to III. There was no difference in the prevalence between the two groups, and between long-segment and short-segment BE. In distal stomach, prevalence of H pylori infection was significantly higher in patients with IM than those without IM. CONCLUSION: There is a protective role of H pylori infection to GERD. There may be no relationship between H pylori infection of stomach and BE. H pylori infection is associated with the development of IM in the distal stomach.
