Prospective colonoscopic study of 36 patients with Barrett's esophagus found colorectal adenomas in 33% of patients. Of patients aged less than 60, four of 17 (24%) had adenomas, while patients aged 60 or more had adenomas in eight of 19 (42%) cases. All adenomas were less than or equal to 10 mm diameter. No colorectal malignancies were found in these patients. This prevalence of neoplasms is consistent with results of autopsy studies. It is concluded that no increased risk of colorectal neoplasms was found in this group of patients with Barrett's esophagus.
