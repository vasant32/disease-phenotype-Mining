The authors, after a dissertation on the aetiopathogenesis of "Barrett's oesophagus", dwell on the precancerous nature of this pathology involving the oesophageal-gastric junction. Its frequent association with cancer explains the necessity for an accurate follow-up in these patients: many investigations can be useful, the radiological study of oesophagus and stomach, manometry, pH-metry, but an irrefutable diagnosis can only be achieved through endoscopy, which makes possible a histological examination of the bioptic fragments. The authors also deal with the ideal therapeutic strategy and differentiate the cases in which the pharmacological therapy is more appropriate from those that need a surgical approach.
