 BACKGROUND: Heartburn is a common manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, known complications of this disease, appear to be less prevalent in Asia than in Western countries. We looked for endoscopic and histologic evidence of Barrett's esophagus in Iranian patients with heartburn. METHODS: During September 2001 to September 2003, endoscopy was done in all patients with heartburn, either lasting longer than 3 months (n=1182) or for 1-3 months but resistant to 4 weeks of omeprazole therapy (n=66). Biopsy was taken from columnar-lined mucosa above the GE junction, at 5 cm above the Z line in normal- appearing mucosa, and from any abnormal areas. RESULTS: Of the 1248 patients (mean age 45 [SD 15.5] years, 750 men; duration of heartburn 68 [SD 87.5] months), 960 (66.5%) had erosive esophagitis and 30 (2.4%) had Barrett's esophagus, including 10 and 20 with long- and short-segment involvement, respectively. Of 134 patients with normal-appearing mucosa, 122 had histologic evidence of esophagitis. CONCLUSION: Barrett's esophagus may be less common in Iran than in Western countries, despite presence of severe heartburn and erosive esophagitis.
