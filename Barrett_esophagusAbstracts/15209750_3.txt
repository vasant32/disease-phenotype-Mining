Minimally invasive esophageal resection is a technically demanding procedure that may reduce patient morbidity and improve convalescence when compared with the open approach. Despite these proposed advantages, the minimally invasive approach has not been widely embraced and is routinely performed in only a few specialized centers around the world. The laparoscopic inversion esophagectomy attempts to eliminate some of the technical obstacles inherent in this procedure by simplifying the transhiatal mediastinal dissection, facilitating vagal preservation, and enhancing safety. We present a case of a 37-year-old man who underwent laparoscopic inversion esophagectomy for Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia. Immediate and long-term outcome measures are being prospectively gathered in order to establish the ultimate value of this procedure.
