 OBJECTIVE: To examine the chemopreventive effect of selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib for Barrett's esophagus in rats. METHODS: Fifty 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats underwent esophagojejunostomy to induce Barrett's esophagus model. Four weeks after operation the animals were given celecoxib 10 mg/(kg*d(-1))(celecoxib group), or saline 1 ml (control group). Another 10 rats were sham operation group. All animals were sacrificed at 20 week after surgery. The degree of inflammation, Barrett's esophagus, adenocarcinoma, COX-2 expression and PGE(2) of animals were assessed. RESULT: Among 60 rats, 6 rats died in celecoxib group, 8 rats died in control group, 1 rat died in sham operation group, and 45 (75%) rats completed the study. The incidence of mild, moderate and severe degree esophageal inflammation in celecoxib group and control group was 14/19(73.68%), 4/19(21.05%), 1/19(5.26%); 4/17(23.53%), 5/17(29.41%), 8/17(47.06%)(P<0.05), respectively. The incidence of Barrett's esophagus was 7/19(36.84%), 13/17(76.47%) in two group respectively(P<0.05); The incidence of Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia was 2/19(10.53%), 8/17(47.06%)(P<0.05), respectively. The expression of COX-2 was 1/7(14.29%), 10/13(76.92%)(P<0.05) in two groups. PGE2 content was significantly lower in the celecoxib group than that in control group(P<0.001). No esophageal pathological changes were found in sham operation group. CONCLUSION: Selective COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib can inhibit inflammations, development of Barrett's esophagus and esophagus adenocarcinoma.
