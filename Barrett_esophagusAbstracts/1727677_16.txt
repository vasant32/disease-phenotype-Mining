As a potentially premalignant condition, Barrett's esophagus has stimulated controversy over the need for surveillance of glandular dysplasia and early carcinoma. This prompted the authors to review their experience with endoscopic cytologic brushings and biopsies from patients with Barrett's esophagus. The authors reviewed 65 consecutive specimens from 42 patients with Barrett's esophagus in which both the concurrently obtained esophageal cytologic brushings and companion biopsy specimens were available. In addition, esophagogastrectomy specimens from 9 nine these patients were reviewed. Cytologic and histologic specimens were assigned to one of four diagnostic categories, based on specifically defined criteria: simple Barrett's esophagus with or without inflammatory atypia; dysplasia; adenocarcinoma; or suspicious for dysplasia or carcinoma. Simple Barrett's esophagus was diagnosed in 38 cytologic brushings and 44 biopsy specimens, dysplasia in 4 brushings and 7 biopsy specimens, and carcinoma in 14 brushings and 10 biopsy specimens. Nine brushings and three biopsy specimens were suspicious. In 13 cases, brushings revealed a higher grade lesion than did histology; in 5 cases, biopsy specimens showed a higher grade lesion. Agreement between the two occurred in 72% (47/65) of all specimens. Accuracy was confirmed in the histologic examinations of the resection specimens. The authors conclude that specific criteria, when consistently applied, allow accurate cytologic diagnoses of epithelial changes in Barrett's esophagus. The use of esophageal brush cytology and biopsy specimens provides two complementary techniques, which detect a greater number of serious lesions than either technique alone.
