Over the last years the incidence of esophageal cancer in Germany has been rising. One of the reasons of this rise is the increase of adenocarcinoma (AC) of the esophagus, a nearly unknown diagnosis 30 years ago. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is rising, too. The main risk factors for the development of SCC as well as for AC are heavy smoking and alcohol. Barrett's esophagus is predominantly developing in men after a longer lasting gastroesophageal reflux. In consequence, AC of the esophagus will be observed mostly in men. Patients with AC differ from patients with SCC by a smaller number of concomitant diseases, which are often caused by obesity of patients with AC. The preoperative risk factors of patients with SCC are caused by tobacco and alcohol. Only patients with early cancer (pT1) of the esophagus have a good prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 83% for AC and 63% for SCC.
