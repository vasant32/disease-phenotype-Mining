The development of an oesophageal adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's mucosa is associated with a multistep process of genetic lesions that may be triggered by persistent oxidative damage. The glutathione peroxidase isoforms pGPx and GI-GPx, which were identified recently in the mucosa of the esophagus, may play a role as defense factors to prevent such oxidative injury. To determine alterations of the expression of pGPx and GI-GPx in Barrett's mucosa as compared to primary and regenerative squamous epithelium. Biopsy samples of oesophageal mucosa of patients with Barrett's esophagus (n = 12), patients with squamous restoration after thermal ablation (n = 10), and healthy controls (n = 5) were analyzed for pGPx and GI-GPx mRNA expression by Northern blot and for glutathione peroxidase activity by enzymatic assay. Squamous regeneration was induced by argon plasma coagulation (APC) combined with proton pump inhibitor therapy. In Barrett's epithelium mRNA levels of pGPx (the secreted isoform) were significantly reduced and of GI-GPx (the intracellular isoform) significantly increased as compared to normal squamous mucosa. In squamous mucosa that had regenerated after APC, no significant differences compared to the expression pattern of primary squamous mucosa were found. Compared to squamous mucosa, Barrett's metaplasia shows a different mRNA expression of pGPx and GI-GPx that may be associated with increased susceptibility to oxidative damage.
