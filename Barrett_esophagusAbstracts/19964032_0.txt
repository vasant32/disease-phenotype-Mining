This letter reports the development of an endoscopic polarized scanning spectroscopy (EPSS) instrument compatible with existing endoscopes. This instrument uses light scattering spectroscopy (LSS). In proof-of-principle studies using a single-point instrument, LSS has successfully demonstrated the ability to identify pre-cancer in the epithelial tissues of five different organs, including Barrett's esophagus (BE). The EPSS instrument can provide real time in vivo information on the location of otherwise invisible high grade dysplasia (HGD), a predictor of adenocarcinoma, and thus can serve as a guide for biopsy. It should greatly reduce the time and labor involved in performing screening and obtaining diagnoses, cause less patient discomfort and ensure that fewer biopsies are required for the reliable location of pre-cancerous lesions.
