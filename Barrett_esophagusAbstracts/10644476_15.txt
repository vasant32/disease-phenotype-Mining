BACKGROUND: The development of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and Barrett's associated adenocarcinoma (BAA) in the rat after experimental inducement of esophageal reflux of gastric, bile, and pancreatic juice has been reported by others. The purpose of this study was to determine whether similar results could be demonstrated in the mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eight Swiss-Webster mice were used in this study and were divided into three groups: Group I, 37 mice with esophagojejunostomy; Group II, 39 mice with esophagojejunostomy and the carcinogen N-methyl-N-benzylnitrosamine (MBN); and Group III, 32 mice with MBN alone. The animals were sacrificed after 19 weeks. Macroscopic and histopathologic examinations were performed. RESULTS: One hundred mice survived and were available for pathologic study. Macroscopic evidence suggested esophagitis in 60.6% of mice in Group I, 62.8% of mice in Group II, and 9% of mice in Group III and suggested tumor in 3% of mice in Group I, 51.4% of mice in Group II, and 53.1% of mice in Group III. Histopathologic analysis disclosed BE in 42.4% of mice in Group I, 20% of mice in Group II, and 12.5% of mice in Group III. Cancer was present in 12.2% of mice in Group I, 54.3% of mice in Group II, and 46.9% of mice in Group III. Adenocarcinoma with or without squamous cell carcinoma was present in 6.1% of mice in Group I, 37.1% of mice in Group II, and 12.5% of mice in Group III. CONCLUSIONS: Esophagojejunostomy plus MBN in the mouse results in BE, BAA, or both in 57.1% of animals, consistent with findings in the rat model after similar interventions.
