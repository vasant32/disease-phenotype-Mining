The grading of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus has prognostic importance, however observer variation limits the reliability of simple histological analysis alone. We investigated Ki-67, p53 and Bcl-2 expression in Barrett's esophagus, in the sequence from Barrett's low-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia and infiltrating adenocarcinoma. Forty-four esophagectomy specimens were utilized: 39 specimens with esophageal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma and 5 specimens with esophageal dysplasia only. This gave 83 sections (2 sections for specimens with dyplasia and carcinoma) examined from 44 patients. The sections were examined for Ki-67, p53 and Bcl-2 reactivity by immunohistochemistry. Low-grade dysplasia was present in 14 sections, high-grade dysplasia in 30 sections and carcinoma in 39 sections. Ki-67 expression occurred in 2 out of 14 (14%) sections with low-grade dysplasia, in 22 out of 30 (73%) sections with high-grade dysplasia and in 34 out of 39 (87%) sections with carcinoma (p<0.001). p53 protein expression was found in 1 of 14 (7%) sections with low-grade dysplasia, in 18 of 30 (60%) sections with high-grade dysplasia and in 33 of 39 (85%) sections with carcinoma (p<0.001). Expression of Bcl-2 was found in 11 of 14 (84%) sections with low-grade dysplasia but immunoreactivity was not seen in any section with high-grade dysplasia or Barrett's carcinoma. Our results indicate that overexpression of Ki-67, Bcl-2 protein and p53 mutations can be identified as early events during neoplastic progression in Barrett's esophagus. These data support the hypothesis that, in the progression of Barrett's metaplasia to adenocarcinoma, the balance of proliferation/apoptosis plays an important role.
