BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing number of patients undergoing endoscopic therapy for Barrett's esophagus (BE) with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or intramucosal cancer (IMC), there are few data to guide clinical decision making and research initiatives in the area of posttreatment follow-up. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define expert practice patterns regarding follow-up after endoscopic treatment of BE with HGD and IMC. DESIGN: Electronic survey. SUBJECTS: Forty-eight endoscopists in the United States with expertise in BE endotherapy based on high-impact publications and national reputation. INTERVENTION: A 21-item Web-based survey inquiring about post-BE endotherapy follow-up practices. RESULTS: Of 48 expert endoscopists, 42 completed the survey. After successful treatment of BE with HGD or IMC, all experts perform surveillance upper endoscopy, most commonly at 3-month intervals in the first posttreatment year, every 6 months during the second year, and annually thereafter. None of the experts perform surveillance EUS after treatment of HGD, and only 19% perform EUS after treatment of IMC. After cancer eradication, only 36% of experts refer patients for CT, and 24% refer patients for positron emission tomography. Thirty-eight percent of experts refer patients for a surgical opinion when IMC extends into the muscularis mucosa; 100% refer when IMC extends into submucosa. LIMITATIONS: Not a consensus document; only U.S. experts included. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the follow-up practices of expert endoscopists after successful endotherapy forÂ BE with HGD and IMC. Additional research is necessary to establish optimal surveillance intervals, the role of follow-up EUS, CT, and positron emission tomography, as well as the surgical implications of low-risk IMC extending into the muscularis mucosa.
