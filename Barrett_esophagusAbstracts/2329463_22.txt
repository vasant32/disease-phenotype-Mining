Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on 14 of our 18 long-term (more than 2 years) gastric tube esophagus survivors, with special attention paid to cervical gastric metaplasia. Barrett's esophagus was found in 10 patients. In eight cases, this could also be histologically verified. Three patients had esophagitis, but no verified gastric metaplasia. Isotope reflux studies were performed on six patients, all having both endoscopically and histologically shown pathology in the cervical esophagus. Reflux was provoked by putting patients in different positions. Only one patient showed gastrotubal reflux, and only in the prone Trendelenburg position. We conclude that Barrett's esophagus is a common complication of gastric tube patients, and is probably due to acid secreted by the tube itself. Life-long endoscopic follow-up of these patients is warranted.
