AIMS: Risk reduction for Barrett's cancer in individuals taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, one of the inhibited enzymes, is putatively involved in Barrett's cancer pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to examine a possible association between COX-2 protein expression and the development and progression of the Barrett's metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence and the type and degree of associated inflammatory reaction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Squamous epithelium, metaplastic, low-grade, high-grade dysplastic lesions and tumour tissue of 49 resection specimens from patients with Barrett's adenocarcinoma were immunohistochemically analysed. Active and chronic inflammatory reactions were classified according to the Updated Sydney System. Within the Barrett's sequence, a significant progressive increase in COX-2 expression was identified (P < 0.0001). The most significant differences were detected between squamous epithelium and Barrett's metaplasia (P < 0.001) and from low- to high-grade dysplasia (P < 0.0001). Active and chronic inflammation were significantly different between squamous epithelium and Barrett's metaplasia (P < 0.0001), but not during further progression in the sequence. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing COX-2 expression in Barrett's metaplasia is significantly associated with a change in the local inflammatory reaction, but not during further progression through dysplasia to cancer. This supports the potential of a chemoprevention strategy using COX-2 inhibitors independent of the extent and type of the inflammatory reaction in Barrett's oesophagus.
