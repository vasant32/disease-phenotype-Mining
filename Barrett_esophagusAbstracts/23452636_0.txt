Barrett's esophagus (BE) and gastroesophageal reflux disease are the strongest risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma. To reduce the clinical impact of this disease, endoscopic screening to detect BE has been proposed and nonendoscopic diagnostic techniques are under investigation. Because screening would result in new diagnoses of BE and additional costs related to endoscopic surveillance, novel tools for risk stratification are also warranted. Dysplasia is the gold standard for risk stratification. Molecular biomarkers may provide a more objective and reproducible estimation of the individual risk, and further prospective studies are required as a prelude to introducing biomarkers into routine clinical practice.
