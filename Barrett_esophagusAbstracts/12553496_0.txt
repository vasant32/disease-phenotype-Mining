 BACKGROUND: DNA adduct formation can initiate carcinogenic processes. AIM: To examine the pre-malignant condition of Barrett's esophagus by measuring the DNA adducts. METHODS: DNA adducts were measured in the proximal and distal esophagus of patients with Barrett's esophagus (n = 9), patients with adenocarcinoma in the distal esophagus/esophagogastric junction (n = 28), and in control group of patients (n = 8) using the 32-P-postlabeling method. The average levels of DNA adducts are expressed as mean adducts/10(9) nucleotides + standard error of the mean. RESULTS. The average DNA adduct levels in the distal esophagus were significantly higher in both the Barrett's esophagus (24.5 +/- 7.9) and the adenocarcinoma (12.0 + 3.0) than in the control patients (0.1 +/- 0.08), P < 0.001. In the proximal esophagus, the DNA adduct levels were approximately equal in the Barrett's esophagus (7.0 +/- 1.0) and in the adenocarcinoma group (6.4 +/- 0.65). However, the levels in the proximal esophagus in both groups were significantly higher than in the control group (2.1 +/- 0.67), P < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Barrett's esophagus and patients with esophageal/esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma had significantly more DNA adducts than the control group. These results support the current concept of the carcinogenic potential of chronic gastroesophageal reflux, and the pre-malignant condition of Barrett's esophagus.
