Barrett's esophagus (BE) is known as a precursor of esophageal carcinoma, which can be defined by the presence of specialized columnar epithelium with goblet cells. Histological evaluation of biopsy specimens is time-consuming. Moreover specialized columnar epithelium is often present in a mosaic insertion within columnar-lined lower esophagus and can be missed by random biopsies. Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) allows in vivo visualization of mucosal structure and rapid diagnosis during conventional endoscopy.
