The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of sliding hiatal hernia over the Barrett's oesophagus, including symptoms rate and complications. METHODS: A total of 520 (4.6%) cases of Barrett's oesophagus were found out of 18.276 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, performed in 11.276 patients at a single tertiary centre in a period from 1994 to 2004. RESULTS: Sliding hiatal hernia was found in 58% of patients with Barrett's oesophagus, more frequently in men (60%). The association between hernia and some complications of Barrett's oesophagus was significant (94% of Barrett's ulcer, 77% of low-grade dysplasia with p < 0.01). However, there was no significant association with adenocarcinoma (54%; p > 0.05). The other complications of Barrett's oesophagus (i.e. bleeding, stenosis, high-grade dysplasia) were identified in small number (less than 10), so they were not evaluated statistically. Association between the presence of hiatal hernia and occurrence of symptoms (reflux symptoms, dysphagia, odynophagia, dyspeptic and other symptoms) was significant with p < 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that sliding hiatal hernia may play a significant role as a pathophysiologic factor in Barrett's oesophagus. Complications rate of Barrett's oesophagus were not equally frequent in particular cases with hiatal hernia. The occurrence of symptoms is getting more pronounced in those with sliding hiatal hernia.
