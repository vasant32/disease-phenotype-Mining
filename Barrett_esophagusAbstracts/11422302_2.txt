Recently, Barrett's esophagus and early adenocarcinomas have been detected increasingly frequently in routine follow-up of patients with gastroesophageal reflux. Although surgery is the treatment of choice, some patients are medically unfit for esophagectomy and, in this case, the only alternative curative therapy is radical chemoradiation therapy. In addition, some patients who present with symptoms have small tumors that cannot be localized accurately using routine imaging techniques. This report describes a series of eight patients with small esophageal cancers in whom the tumors were successfully localized following endoscopic injection of contrast, and treated with chemoradiation therapy. The treatment was successful in seven patients. This method of tumor localization demonstrated that conventional techniques are mostly unreliable when applied to very early cancers.
