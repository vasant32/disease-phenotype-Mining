Barrett's esophagus is a precancerous condition in which the squamous esophageal epithelium is replaced by a columnar epithelium. Although different types of columnar epithelium have been described, the most frequently encountered is specialized columnar epithelium or intestinal metaplasia. Most investigators believe that increased cancer risk is only associated with this type. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing in frequency in the United States and in Western Europe. Recent studies highlight the importance of gastroesophageal reflux disease in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Bile-acid reflux may also play a role. Increasing interest has been expressed in short-segment (2-3 cm) Barrett's esophagus. The contribution of short-segment Barrett's esophagus to cancer at the gastroesophageal junction is currently being studied. Although regular surveillance is often recommended, the commonness of Barrett's esophagus makes such a practice impractical for every patient. Biomarker development is needed to identify patients at greatest risk, with p53 a promising candidate based on recent studies. Initial data suggest that redox mechanisms may be involved in Barrett's esophagus. Several methods have recently been described for reversing Barrett's esophagus to squamous epithelium, but the significance of this practice in terms of reducing cancer risk remains to be demonstrated.
