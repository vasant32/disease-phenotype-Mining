 AIM: To test whether antioxidant treatment could prevent the progression of Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma. METHODS: In a rat model of gastroduodenoesophageal reflux by esophagojejunal anastomosis with gastric preservation, groups of 6-10 rats were randomized to receive treatment with superoxide dismutase (SOD) or vehicle and followed up for 4 mo. Rat's esophagus was assessed by histological analysis, superoxide anion and peroxinitrite generation, SOD levels and DNA oxidative damage. RESULTS: All rats undergoing esophagojejunostomy developed extensive esophageal mucosal ulceration and inflammation by mo 4. The process was associated with a progressive presence of intestinal metaplasia beyond the anastomotic area (9% 1st mo and 50% 4th mo) (94% at the anastomotic level) and adenocarcinoma (11% 1st mo and 60% 4th mo). These changes were associated with superoxide anion and peroxinitrite mucosal generation, an early and significant increase of DNA oxidative damage and a significant decrease in SOD levels (P<0.05). Exogenous administration of SOD decreased mucosal superoxide levels, increased mucosal SOD levels and reduced the risk of developing intestinal metaplasia beyond the anastomotic area (odds ratio = 0.326; 95%CI: 0.108-0.981; P = 0.046), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (odds ratio = 0.243; 95%CI: 0.073-0.804; P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Superoxide dismutase prevents the progression of esophagitis to Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma in this rat model of gastrointestinal reflux, supporting a role of antioxidants in the chemoprevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
