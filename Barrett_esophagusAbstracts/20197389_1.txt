The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME(2)), a promising anticancer agent, modulates Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma (BEAC) cell growth and behavior through a cellular pathway involving beta-catenin in partnership with E-cadherin, which seems to play a critical role in the induction of antitumor responses in cancer cells. We found that 2-ME(2) markedly reduced the BEAC cell proliferation through regulating apoptotic machinery such as Bcl-2 and Bax. It may nullify the aggressive behavior of the cells by reducing the migratory behavior. Expressions of beta-catenin and E-cadherin and binding of these two proteins is activated in a 2-ME(2)-dependent fashion in Bic-1 cells. Moreover, overexpressions of these two proteins may be due to the stabilization of these proteins by 2-ME(2). We found that 2-ME(2)-induced antimigratory effects are mediated through the beta-catenin-E-cadherin signaling pathways. In view of these results, we determined whether 2-ME(2) reduces BEAC tumor growth. Administration of 2-ME2 significantly decreased the growth of BEAC cells xenografted on the flank of nude mice. The evidence presented points out that the effect of 2-ME(2) on beta-catenin-orchestrated signal transduction plausibly plays a multifaceted functional role to inhibit the proliferation and cell migration of 2-ME(2)-treated malignant cells and it could be a potential candidate in novel treatment strategies for Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma.
