BACKGROUND & AIMS: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with or without endoscopic resection, effectively eradicates Barrett's esophagus (BE) containing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and/or early-stage cancer. We followed patients who received RFA for BE containing HGIN and/or early-stage cancer for 5 y, to determine the durability of treatment response. METHODS: We followed 54 patients with BE (2 to 12 cm), previously enrolled in 4 consecutive cohort studies in which they underwent focal endoscopic resection in case of visible lesions (n=40, 72%), followed by serial RFA every 3 months. Patients underwent high-resolution endoscopy with narrow-band imaging at 6 and 12 months after treatment and then annually for 5 y (median 61 months; interquartile range, 53-65 months); random biopsy samples were collected from neosquamous epithelium and gastric cardia. After 5 y, endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic resection of neosquamous epithelium were performed. Outcomes included sustained complete remission of neoplasia (CR-neo) or intestinal metaplasia (CR-IM), IM in gastric cardia, or buried glands in neosquamous epithelium. RESULTS: After 5 y, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed sustained CR-neo and CR-IM in 90% of patients; neoplasia recurred in 3 patients and was managed endoscopically. Focal IM in the cardia was found in 19/54 patients (35%), in 53/1143 gastric cardia biopsies (4.6%). The incidence of IM of the cardia did not increase over time; and IM was diagnosed based in only a single biopsy in 89% of patients. Buried glands were detected in 3/3543 neosquamous epithelium biopsies (0.08%, from 3 patients). No endoscopic resection samples had buried glands. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who have undergone RFA, with or without endoscopic resection, for neoplastic BE, 90% of patients remain in remission after 5 y FU with all recurrences managed endoscopically. This treatment approach is therefore an effective and durable alternative to esophagectomy.
