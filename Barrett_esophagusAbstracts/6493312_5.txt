Exophiala jeanselmei was isolated from three esophageal cultures over an 11-month period at Lutheran General Hospital. We believe this provides evidence for a new site of isolation, since previous reports of the organism's incidence were confined to skin and lung. Case 1 is an eight-year-old female with a three-year history of gagging and vomiting. Esophagoscopy revealed a mass biopsied as vegetable material. Case 2 is a 66-year-old retired male with a history of obesity, diabetes and spinal stenosis. Following back surgery, the patient developed odynophagia. Esophageal biopsies showed ulceration and bacterial colonies with no evidence of fungus. Case 3 is a 62-year-old male gardener who is also a nail biter. Esophagoscopy revealed a gastro-esophageal stricture with reflux and evidence of a hiatus hernia. Material biopsied was consistent with Barrett's esophagus and evidence of fungi was seen. The esophageal mass of case 1 and the esophageal brushings of case 2 and 3 grew E. jeanselmei. Aspiration, reflux, and mechanical disruption of the esophageal mucosa are possible predisposing factors in colonization of esophageal lesions by this ubiquitous, normally low virulence organism.
