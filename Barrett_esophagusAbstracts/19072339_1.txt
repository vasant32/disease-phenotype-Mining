This invited profile summarizes the technical aspects and clinical trial results related to the use of circumferential and focal radiofrequency ablation in the management algorithm for Barrett's esophagus. What makes this relatively new endoscopic intervention unique is its promising safety and efficacy profile reported in published clinical trials. This technology appears to have overcome many of the limitations of prior endoscopic ablative modalities, and is thus garnering a role in the management of this disease state.
