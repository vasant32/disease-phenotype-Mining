The molecular basis of attaining columnar phenotype in Barrett's esophagus is poorly understood. One hypothesis states that factors locally produced by cells of mesenchymal origin in chronic reflux esophagitis induce metaplastic transformation. This study was performed to elucidate the factors secreted from fibroblasts that cause columnar phenotype in adjacent squamous epithelium. Human fibroblast cells were exposed to acidified medium for 20 min, followed by medium neutralization for 2 h, and then total RNA was hybridized to Sentrix Human-6 Expression BeadChips. Furthermore, esophageal mucosal biopsy specimens from reflux esophagitis patients were examined for HB-EGF expression using immunohistochemistry. In addition, cells from the human esophageal squamous epithelial cell line HET1A were treated with recombinant HB-EGF, and changes in expressions of Cdx2 and columnar markers were analyzed. The gene expression profile revealed significant upregulation of a variety of growth factors and inflammatory chemokines in response to acid exposure. Among them, HB-EGF was upregulated more than 10-fold. Biopsy specimens from reflux esophagitis patients showed a strong expression of HB-EGF in fibroblast cells underlying the damaged epithelium. Furthermore, in vitro stimulation of HET1A cells with HB-EGF increased Cdx2 in dose-dependent manners. Functional analysis of human Cdx2 promoter also revealed its upregulation by HB-EGF stimulation, showing the role of potential responsive elements (AP-1 and NF-kappaB) for its transcriptional activation. Moreover, the columnar markers cytokeratin 7 and villin were also upregulated by HB-EGF stimulation. HB-EGF induces several genes characteristics of columnar phenotypes of esophageal squamous epithelium in a paracrine manner.
