 BACKGROUND: Duodeno-gastro-esophageal reflux (DGER) is considered as an independent risk factor for complicated reflux disease (GERD). Patients with Barrett's esophagus have significantly higher levels of DGER than patients with uncomplicated GERD. However, the clinical response to conventional high-dose PPI therapy in patients with uncomplicated GERD and DGER is largely unknown. METHODS: 30 patients with uncomplicated GERD and combined pathological reflux (acid and bile) were enrolled in the study. Clinical work-up included evaluation of clinical symptoms, esophageal manometry and upper endoscopy. After 6 - 8 weeks of treatment with Pantoprazole 80 mg/d pH measurement and Bilitec 2000 were repeated, and the pattern of symptoms was re-evaluated. RESULTS: Under treatment with Pantoprazole 80 mg/d acid reflux was normalised in 28 patients (93 %). Similarly the mean percentage of DGER (time with an absorption greater than 0.14) was significantly reduced from 19.6 % (+/- 13.7) to 5.7 % (+/- 7.7, p < 0.05). In 15 patients (50 %) an elevated DGER persisted under treatment with Pantoprazole (DGER-NR group) whereas in 15 cases (50 %) a normalisation could be achieved (DGER-R group). The DGER-NR group had significantly higher levels of bile reflux before (and under) treatment compared to the DGER-R group: 22.9 % (9.98 %) vs. 15.6 % (0.72 %), respectively. Overall, the median quality of life index (QLI) improved from 4.78 (+/- 0.86) before to 8.04 +/- 1.84) under therapy. The clinical response under treatment was marikedly reduced in the DGER-NR group compared to the DGER-R group: QLI 7.3 vs. 8.9. Particularly heartburn and nocturnal coughing persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that high-dose pantoprazole therapy effectively exerts acid suppression in GERD patients with combined pathological reflux. However, DGER could only normalised in 50 % of patients. High levels of DGER at diagnosis enhance the risk of persistent DGER under PPI therapy and are associated with a reduced clinical outcome.
