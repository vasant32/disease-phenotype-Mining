Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, which has an increased incidence rate over the last few decades. Its importance stems from the poor five-year survival of esophageal adenocarcinoma and current data that suggest a survival benefit when surveillance programs are implemented. In this review, we will cover the pathophysiology and natural history of BE and the different endoscopic findings. The prevalence of BE in different geographic areas and the incidence of high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in this patient population is reviewed. Recent recommendation for screening and surveillance of BE has been covered in this review as well as the efficacy of nonconventional imaging modalities and endoscopic ablation therapies.
