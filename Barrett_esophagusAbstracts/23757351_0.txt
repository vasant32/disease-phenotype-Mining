PURPOSE Recent microarray and RNA-sequencing studies have uncovered aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRs) in Barrett's esophagus (BE)-associated esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The functional significance of these miRs in EAC initiation and progression is largely unknown. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Expression levels of miR-199a/b-3p, -199a-5p, -199b-5p, -200b, -200c, -223, and -375 were determined in microdissected tissues from cardiac mucosa, BE, dysplastic BE, and EAC using quantitative real time PCR. MiR-223 expression was validated in precursors and EACs from 95 EAC patients by in situ hybridization (ISH). MiR-223 was transfected into two EAC cell lines, and in vitro assays were performed. Target genes were identified using Illumina microarray, and results were validated in cell lines and human specimens. RESULTS MiR-199 family members and miR-223 were significantly over-expressed in EAC, however only miR-223 showed a stepwise increase during EAC carcinogenesis. A similar trend was observed by ISH, which additionally showed that miR-223 is exclusively expressed by the epithelial compartment. MiR-223 over-expressing cells had statistically significantly more migratory and invasive potential than scramble sequence transfected cells. PARP1 was identified as a direct target gene of miR-223 in EAC cells. Increased sensitivity to chemotherapy was observed in cells with enforced miR-223 expression and reduced PARP1. CONCLUSIONS MiR-223 is significantly up-regulated during the BE-dysplasia-EAC sequence. Although high miR-223 levels might contribute to an aggressive phenotype, our results also suggest that EAC patients with high miR-223 levels might benefit from treatment with DNA-damaging agents.
