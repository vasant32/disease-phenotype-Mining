 OBJECTIVE: Barrett's oesophagus (BE) is the major risk factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). SSc is associated with an increased risk of BE related to chronic reflux. The aim of this study is to determine the outcomes of BE and estimate the EAC risk in SSc patients over a 3-year prospective study. METHODS: SSc patients were recruited through EUSTAR network centres. Inclusion criterion was a recent histological finding of BE. The patients were then prospectively followed and, as recommended, a second oesophageal endoscopy was performed according to the presence of BE-related dysplasia at baseline. RESULTS: A total of 50 SSc patients with BE (40 without and 10 with dysplasia) were included and 46 completed the follow-up (138 patient-years). During the 3-year follow-up, 4 of the 46 BE patients (3% per year) were diagnosed with high-grade dysplasia/EAC, of which one developed cardial EAC. EAC incidence in the BE subgroup with dysplasia increased to 4% per year compared with the absence of EAC cases in the BE subgroup without dysplasia at baseline. CONCLUSION: Our results, in accordance with previous published data suggesting an increased risk of EAC or cardial adenocarcinoma in SSc, highlight the need for accurate follow-up of BE SSc patients at risk of developing adenocarcinoma.
