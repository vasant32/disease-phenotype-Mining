The association of infection with Helicobacter pylori and antral (type B) gastritis now is clear, and the development of sensitive and specific serologic assays for IgA and IgG allows for diagnosis of this infection by noninvasive means. With use of these assays, we studied the association of infection with H. pylori and four other upper gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions: Barrett's esophagus, pernicious anemia (which accompanies type A gastritis), and duodenal and gastric ulcers. H. pylori was present in only 39% of 41 patients with Barrett's esophagus whose gastric biopsy specimens were examined histologically. Each serologic assay correctly categorized 39 (95.1%) of the 41 patients. For both assays the frequency of seropositivity noted for 58 patients with Barrett's esophagus was not different from that noted for age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Among 40 patients with pernicious anemia, the results of assays for IgA and IgG were positive for 17.5% and 0%, respectively; these prevalences were significantly less than the 50% (IgA) and 40% (IgG) positivities noted for matched controls (P less than .01 for each; McNemar's test). Among 57 patients with documented duodenal or gastric ulcers, the results of assays for IgG and IgA were positive for 100% and 98.2%, respectively; these prevalences were significantly higher than the rate noted for matched controls (P less than .001 for duodenal ulcers and P = .02 for gastric ulcers for IgA assay). These data suggest that infection with H. pylori is strongly associated with duodenal and gastric ulcers, negatively associated with pernicious anemia, and independent of Barrett's esophagus.
