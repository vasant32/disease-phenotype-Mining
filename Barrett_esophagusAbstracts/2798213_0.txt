An analysis of the clinical picture of Barrett's esophagus in 18 children is presented. This group of patients have been distinguished out of 114 children with chronic gastroesophageal reflux on the base of anatomopathological examinations. Clinical course and efficiency of the diagnostic examinations depend on the degree of esophagitis. They are slightly characteristic in children with minimal lesions. Long-term follow up - necessary due to the risk of cancer - have shown that there is possibility of recovery in cases of minimal advancement and short duration of the disease.
