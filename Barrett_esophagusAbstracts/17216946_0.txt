A large number of studies were performed that support the association of Helicobacter pylori infection and the development of (GERD), although to prove that this association is a causation is still a matter of dispute. The objectives of this study was to prove this causal association in order to be able to plan a program for intervention. The work was conducted on 30 patients suffering from symptoms suggestive of gastro-esophogeal reflux disease diagnosed by upper endoscopic examination and 20 matched controls were chosen complaining from dyspeptic symptoms but with completely normal by upper endoscopic examination. The patients and controls were selected from Mataria Teaching Hospital and Ain Shams Specialized Hospital in Cairo and subjected to complete history taking, clinical examination, endoscopic examination and biopsy from the lower end of esophagus for examination of the presence of Helicobacter Pylon. No causal association between infection with Helicobacter pylon and the development of (GERD) could be demonstrated. It is highly recommended to further investigate this association in patients with grade IV esophagitis (Barrett's esophagus) only.
