Barrett esophagus, the columnar-lined distal esophagus acquired as a consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux, is associated with the development of columnar epithelial dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma. To determine the efficacy of cytopathology in identifying Barrett esophagus and related neoplasia, observations were compared on 150 esophageal cytology samples with concurrent endoscopic biopsy specimens. Sixty-six specimens that contained benign columnar epithelium in either cytologic or biopsy material were identified. Distinctive-type Barrett mucosa with incomplete intestinalization, considered diagnostic of Barrett esophagus, was found in 34 of 66 cases (52%) and was present only in cytologic material in 11 cases. Twenty-two specimens contained cardiac-type mucosa (present only in cytology in ten cases), a finding of uncertain significance due to lack of localization of the sample with respect to the gastroesophageal junction. Fundic-type mucosa was not observed in any specimen. Two cases of distinctive-type Barrett mucosa with columnar epithelial dysplasia were identified in both biopsy and cytology specimens. Among eight Barrett-associated carcinomas (seven adenocarcinomas and one squamous), cytologic material was diagnostic for malignancy in seven and highly suspicious in one. It was concluded that cytopathologic studies are a useful adjunct to biopsy histopathology in the diagnosis of Barrett esophagus and associated carcinoma. The role of cytopathology in the diagnosis of Barrett-related columnar epithelial dysplasia requires further study, and at present a cautious approach with biopsy confirmation is recommended.
