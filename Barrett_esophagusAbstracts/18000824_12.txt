In this study, we applied high-resolution, two-dimensional, gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight and tandem mass spectrometry analysis (MALDI TOF MS) to identify novel proteins that are involved in Barrett's tumorigenesis. We analyzed 12 primary tissue samples that included 8 Barrett's-related adenocarcinomas (BA) and 4 normal mucosae samples. Twenty-three spots were consistently altered (>or=2-fold) in at least half of the tumors when compared with all normal samples and thus subjected to further analysis. The MALDI TOF MS analysis demonstrated biologically interesting upregulated proteins such as ErbB3, Dr5 and Cyclin D1 as well as several members of the zinc finger proteins (Znf146, Znf212 and Znf363). Examples of downregulated proteins included Lgi1 and Klf6. We selected four proteins (ErbB3, Dr5, Znf146 and Lgi1) that are novel for BAs for validation using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR on 39 BA tissue samples when compared with normal samples. We demonstrated mRNA upregulation of ERBB3 (51.3%), DR5 (41%) and ZNF146 (30.7%) and downregulation of LGI1 (100%) in BA. We have further validated the protein overexpression of ErbB3, Dr5 and Znf146, using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis on a tissue microarray that contained 75 BAs and normal gastric and esophageal mucosae samples. BA tissue samples demonstrated overexpression of ErbB3 (42%), Dr5 (90%) and Znf146 (30%) when compared with normal tissues. In conclusion, we have identified and validated several novel proteins that are involved in Barrett's carcinogenesis.
