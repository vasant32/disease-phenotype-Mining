 BACKGROUND: For solid tumors, image cytometry has been shown to be more sensitive for diagnosing DNA content abnormalities (aneuploidy) than flow cytometry. Image cytometry has often been performed using the semi-automated CAS 200 system. Recently, an Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) was introduced to determine DNA content (DNA index), but it has not been validated. METHODS: Using the CAS 200 system and ACIS, we compared the DNA index (DI) obtained from the same archived formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples from Barrett's esophagus related lesions, including samples with specialized intestinal metaplasia without dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Although there was a very good correlation between the DI values determined by ACIS and CAS 200, the former was 25% more sensitive in detecting aneuploidy. ACIS yielded a mean DI value 18% higher than that obtained by CAS 200 (p < 0.001; paired t test). In addition, the average time required to perform a DNA ploidy analysis was shorter with the ACIS (30-40 min) than with the CAS 200 (40-70 min). Results obtained by ACIS gave excellent inter-and intra-observer variability (coefficient of correlation > 0.9 for both, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Compared with the CAS 200, the ACIS is a more sensitive and less time consuming technique for determining DNA ploidy. Results obtained by ACIS are also highly reproducible.
