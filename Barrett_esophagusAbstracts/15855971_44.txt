 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of detecting high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early cancer (EC) in Barrett's esophagus (BE) with a prototype video autofluorescence endoscope. METHODS: Sixty patients with BE were evaluated with a prototype, high-resolution videoendoscope that has separate charge-coupled devices for white light endoscopy (WLE) and autofluorescence imaging (AFI). Nondysplastic BE appears green on AFI, whereas potentially neoplastic areas appear blue/violet. The BE was first screened with WLE for visible abnormalities and then was examined by AFI to detect additional lesions. Lesions that raised a suspicion of neoplasia and control areas that were normal on AFI were sampled for histopathologic assessment. Finally, random 4-quadrant biopsy specimens were obtained at 2-cm intervals. RESULTS: A diagnosis of HGD/EC was made in 22 patients; one patient had no visible abnormality, and 21 had endoscopically detectable areas with HGD/EC. In 6 of the latter 21 patients, the HGD/EC was detected with AFI alone; in another patient, HGD/EC was detected with AFI and random biopsies. In 14 patients, HGD/EC was detected with both WLE and AFI; in 3 of these 14 patients, additional lesions containing HGD/EC were detected by AFI alone. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that video AFI may improve the detection of HGD/EC in patients with BE.
