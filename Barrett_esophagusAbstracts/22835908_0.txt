Most of the children operated for esophageal atresia will survive the neonatal period. However, medium-term and late complications are frequent in this population. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is observed in 26 to 75% of the cases and can be responsible for peptic esophagitis, anastomotic stenosis, and Barrett esophagus, which is a risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Dysphagia is frequently observed, sometimes several years after the surgery, affecting up to 45% of children at the age of 5 years. Growth retardation is present in nearly one-third of children at the age of 5 years. Ear, nose, and throat and respiratory complications are also very frequent but tend to improve with time. Tracheomalacia is found in 75% of these children at birth, sometimes responsible for severe complications (malaise, bradycardia). Respiratory symptoms are dominated by chronic cough, wheezing, and infections reported in 29% of the children by the age of 5 years. Restrictive, obstructive syndromes and bronchial hyperactivity can be observed, but usually remain moderate. All these complications can influence the patient's quality of life, which is moderately impaired compared to healthy controls. The high frequency of late sequelae in esophageal atresia justifies regular and multidisciplinary follow-up through adulthood.
