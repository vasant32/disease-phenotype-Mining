The radiologic findings in 39 cases of histologically proven Barrett esophagus are reviewed. Esophageal strictures were not found in 18% of the cases, and when present were more often distally located. Esophageal ulcers were found in only 46% of the patients. In 13% of the cases neither ulcer nor stricture was found. The majority (72%) of these cases did not fit the classic stereotype of high esophageal stricture and/or ulcer.
