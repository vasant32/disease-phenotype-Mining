The surface epithelial cells of Barrett's esophagus were characterized using quantitative scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy with mucin histochemical stains. Fifty-one biopsy specimens of Barrett's esophagus from 15 patients and 31 control specimens of the stomach and intestines from 9 patients were examined. Three distinct surface cell types, in addition to the goblet cell, were recognized in Barrett's epithelium: the gastric-like cell in 31% of specimens, which was similar to the normal gastric surface cell by quantitative scanning electron microscopy; the intestinal-like cell in 41%, which was most similar to the normal small intestinal surface cell; and the variant cell in 80%, which had a range of surface features. By light microscopy, all specimens with variant and intestinal-like cells were classified as specialized columnar epithelium. The surface mucous cells in Barrett's epithelium displayed a variety of mucin staining patterns with acid nonsulfated (small intestinal-like) mucin present in 90% of specimens and acid sulfated (colonic-like) mucin in 43% of specimens. Quantitative scanning electron microscopy and mucin histochemical stains reveal a striking cellular heterogeneity not apparent by routine light microscopy.
