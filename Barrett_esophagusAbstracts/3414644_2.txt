Between January 1984 and December 1986, 116 patients were found to have columnar-lined esophagus (Barrett's esophagus) during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Twenty-eight patients (16 men and 12 women) were found to have peptic ulcer of the esophagus (Barrett's ulcer). In 17 (60%), standard measures and ranitidine 300 mg daily resulted in healing. Two men with resistant ulcers were treated by surgical repair of their hiatus hernia. Nine (six men, three women) in whom healing failed to occur on this regimen after 3-15 months were treated with high dose ranitidine (300 mg bd). In five, healing was complete after 8 wk and one more healed after an additional 4 wk. The three patients with unhealed ulcers after high dose ranitidine received omeprazole 40 mg in the morning. In two of these, ulcers healed after 4 wk; in the third, one of two ulcers persisted after 8 wk, although the remaining ulcer was smaller and more superficial. Pain relief was good, but minor reflux symptoms persisted in both treatment groups. On completion of the study, patients received 300 mg ranitidine at night. Powerful acid-reducing regimens may be required to heal a proportion of Barrett's ulcers.
