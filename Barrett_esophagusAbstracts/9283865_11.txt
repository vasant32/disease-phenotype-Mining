BACKGROUND: The "gold standard" and only accurate method for diagnosing Barrett's esophagus is by esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy. We evaluated the ability of high-resolution endoluminal sonography (HRES) to detect the mucosal changes in Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: Seventeen patients with documented Barrett's and 12 normal controls underwent endoscopy with HRES examination using a 20 MHz ultrasound transducer to evaluate for mucosal changes. HRES examinations were videotaped then reviewed by an unblinded investigator to identify criteria possibly diagnostic of Barrett's and then by a blinded investigator to test the validity of these criteria. Barrett's was diagnosed by HRES if the second hypoechoic layer appeared thicker than the first hyperechoic layer of the mucosa. Normal mucosa was defined as having a pencil-thin second hypoechoic layer on HRES. Measurements of the second hypoechoic layer were made using a computer and compared in patients with Barrett's and patients with normal esophagus. RESULTS: All 17 patients with Barrett's were correctly identified by HRES (sensitivity 100%). Ten of 12 controls were correctly identified as normal (specificity 86%). There was good correlation between HRES and pathologic diagnoses (r 0.86). The second hypoechoic layer was significantly thicker in Barrett's patients than in normal controls (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: HRES is a sensitive new method for identifying Barrett's esophagus. However, dysplasia could not be identified by HRES in this study.
