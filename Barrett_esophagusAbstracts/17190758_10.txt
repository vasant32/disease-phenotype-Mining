 OBJECTIVE: Several studies have shown that argon plasma coagulation (APC) combined with proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is a suitable procedure to eradicate Barrett's epithelium for a short-term follow-up. The real impact of this kind of management with respect to cancer risk and durability of squamous regeneration remains unclear. We present the follow-up data for up to 51 months after eradication of Barrett's mucosa. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 1998-2001, 25 patients with Barrett's esophagus were included in a prospective study. After baseline documentation, Barrett's epithelium was treated with repeated APC until complete squamous restoration was reached. Thereafter, all patients were continuously treated with high-dose PPIs. RESULTS: Each patient underwent a median of four APC sessions. Twenty-one (84%) of the patients had complete squamous regeneration at the end of treatment. During a follow-up of up to 51 months, Barrett's epithelium was found to have recurred in 14/21 (66%) patients. Including the patients with initially incomplete squamous restoration, a long-lasting and complete effect was achieved in only 7 patients (28%) after a mean follow-up period of 30 months. CONCLUSIONS: So far, it is still not proven whether coagulation-induced squamous regeneration reduces the risk of Barrett's carcinoma. Furthermore, the high relapse rate, the procedure-related risk, and the high costs incurred preclude the routine use of APC for the treatment of non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus. The different recurrence rates between published studies may be due to technical differences and PPI schedule. We suggest that optimal conditions for the procedure must be defined before further studies are undertaken.
