In 48 patients that suffered subtotal esophagectomy and were submitted to esophagogastroplasty a long term follow-up study was carried out. In four of these patients (8.3%) pathological changes that characterize Barrett's esophagus were found in the esophageal stump. As far as we could verify, such changes were never reported at this localization before. The Barrett's esophagus seems to be intimately linked to reflux esophagitis resulting from the action of acid-peptic and biliary secretions.
