 OBJECTIVE: Telomere shortening is thought to be associated with genetic instability. The purpose of this study was to measure telomere length in a series of Barrett's adenocarcinomas (BAs), focusing on the telomere/centromere fluorescent intensity ratio (TCR) with tissue quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (Q-FISH). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 11 cases of BA were evaluated for upper esophagus (UE), lower esophagus (LE), Barrett's mucosa (BM), BA, and gastric cardiac mucosa (GC). Q-FISH was performed using two kinds of peptide nucleic acid probe, specific for telomeres and centromeres. The sections were analyzed with a CCD camera and original software (Tissue Telo) for measuring TCR. In addition, Laser Capture Microdissection and GeneScan were implemented for evaluation of genetic instability. RESULTS: The TCR values in BM and, to a lesser extent, BA were significantly lower than those in the other tissues, particularly in heterozygosity (LOH)-positive cases. However, no significant difference was evident between microsatellite instability (MSI)-positive and -negative groups. CONCLUSIONS: In our study of BA series, telomere length appeared to change with the degree of histological atypia, with decreases linked to LOH.
