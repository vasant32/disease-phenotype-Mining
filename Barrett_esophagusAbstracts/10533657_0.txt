From 1990 to 1998, 12 patients with columnar metaplasia of the lower esophagus were diagnosed. Only 4 of them displayed a Barrett's epithelium (BE) with a specialized columnar epithelium and globet cells. As it is already published, a male predominance was observed. In three of these patients some predisposing factor to develop BE was detected (i.e. severe central nervous system damage, chronic pulmonary disease, esophageal atresia and chemotherapy). All patients had severe gastroesophageal reflux (GER) with abnormal pH probe. Diagnosis was suggested by characteristic endoscopy images in 2 patients and was confirmed by biopsy in all cases. All patients had been primary treated with proton-bomb inhibitors. Two patients were treated by a Nissen fundoplication, 4 and 6 month after diagnosis, respectively. One patient with severe neurological damage will undergo the same surgery soon. In another patient with caustic esophageal injury, the affected esophagus will be resected, restoring continuity with stomach or colon. In view of the potential oncogenous transformation of BE, the importance of not overlooking this anomaly in all patients with severe GER is highlighted. All cases with predisposing factors to develop BE should be closely followed by periodic examination and multiple biopsies.
