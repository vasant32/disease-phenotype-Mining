Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the replacement of esophageal squamous epithelium by columnar-lined mucosa and carries an increased risk of carcinoma. Endoscopic surveillance has been suggested, but esophageal brush cytology (BC) has not been widely utilized. Cytologic descriptions of BE, especially dysplasias, are sparse. We studied matched cytologic and histologic materials from 26 patients with BE and 4 patients with concurrent BE and adenocarcinoma. In six patients without dysplasia on biopsy, BE was recognized on BC by the presence of goblet cells within clusters of uniform columnar cells with vesicular nuclei. Dysplasia in 18 BC samples revealed small clusters of haphazardly oriented, mildly pleomorphic cells. Their larger nuclei had thickened membranes, evenly dispersed chromatin and occasional multiple nucleoli. The cytologic differentiation of histologically graded low- and high-grade dysplasia was difficult. The carcinoma cases displayed numerous isolated cells exhibiting flagrant malignant features. We conclude that BE lesions are cytologically distinctive and suggest that BC may play a role in surveillance.
