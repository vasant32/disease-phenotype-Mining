BACKGROUND: Adenoma of the esophagus is a rare type of esophageal submucosal tumor. METHODS: An immunohistochemical and histopathologic study is reported of specimen from a patient with adenoma of the esophagus. RESULTS: The eighth reported case of esophageal submucosal adenoma without Barrett epithelium is described. The patient was a 58-year-old man with an adenoma and carcinoma of the esophagus. The adenoma showed papillotubular structures lined with two layers of cuboidal cells within the submucosa and lamina muscularis mucosae, and the carcinoma was of the superficial squamous cell type confined to the submucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Morphologic findings suggested that this adenoma had originated from the duct of the esophageal gland proper.
