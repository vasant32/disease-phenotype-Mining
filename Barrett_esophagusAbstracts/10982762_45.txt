BACKGROUND & AIMS: The origin of intestinal metaplasia in short segments of columnar mucosa at the esophagogastric junction has clinical importance but can be difficult to determine at endoscopy. Cytokeratin (CK) 7 and 20 patterns are specific for long-segment Barrett's esophagus; however, their utility in short-segment Barrett's esophagus has not been assessed. METHODS: Endoscopic biopsy specimens from patients with long-segment Barrett's esophagus (n = 49), suspected short-segment Barrett's esophagus (n = 43), and gastric intestinal metaplasia (n = 26) were immunostained for CK7 and CK20. Comprehensive clinical data were obtained, including age, gender, and hiatal hernia and Helicobacter pylori status. RESULTS: A Barrett's CK7/20 pattern was present in 48 (98%) of 49 patients with long-segment Barrett's esophagus, 35 (82%) of 43 with suspected short-segment Barrett's esophagus, and 0 (0%) of 26 patients with gastric intestinal metaplasia. Patients with suspected short-segment Barrett's esophagus with a Barrett's CK7/20 pattern were clinically similar to those with long-segment Barrett's esophagus. In contrast, patients with suspected short-segment Barrett's esophagus with no Barrett's CK7/20 pattern were clinically similar to those with gastric intestinal metaplasia. CONCLUSIONS: A Barrett's CK7/20 pattern identifies a subset of patients with suspected short-segment Barrett's esophagus who have a patient profile similar to that seen in long-segment Barrett's esophagus. A Barrett's CK7/20 pattern is an objective marker of Barrett's mucosa that in conjunction with appropriate clinical and endoscopic data can be used by clinicians to better define patients with short-segment Barrett's esophagus.
