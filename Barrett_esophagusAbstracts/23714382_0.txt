BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recent population-based studies have demonstrated a low risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) among patients with non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE). We evaluated whether persistence of NDBE over multiple consecutive surveillance endoscopic examinations could be used in risk stratification of patients with BE. METHODS: We performed a multicenter outcomes study of a large cohort of BE patients. Based on the number of consecutive surveillance endoscopies showing NDBE, we identified 5 groups of patients. Patients in Group 1 were found to have NDBE at their first esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Patients in group 2 were found to have NDBE in their first 2 consecutive EGDs. Similarly, patients in groups 3, 4, and 5 were found to have NDBE in 3, 4, and 5 consecutive surveillance EGDs. A logistic regression model was built to determine whether persistence of NDBE independently protected against cancer development. RESULTS: Of a total of 3515 BE patients, 1401 patients met the inclusion criteria (93.3% Caucasian, 87.5 % men, median age 60±17 y). The median follow-up was 5±3.9 y (7846 patient-years). The annual risks of EAC in groups 1-5 were 0.32%, 0.27%, 0.16%, 0.2%, and 0.11% respectively (P for trend=.03). After adjusting for age, sex, and BE length, persistence of NDBE, based on multiple surveillance endoscopies, was associated with a gradually lower likelihood for progression to EAC. CONCLUSION: Persistence of NDBE over several endoscopic examinations identifies patients who are at a low risk for development of EAC. These findings support lengthening surveillance intervals or discontinuing surveillance of patients with persistent NDBE.
