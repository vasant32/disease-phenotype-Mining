We reviewed 9210 upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations during a 66 month period and found 23 (0.24%) diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus (BE). Male/female ratio was 1.3:1. Age was 23-79 year old (y/o) mean 50.60 y/o. Histological diagnosis was confirmed in 23/35 cases and cardiac type was present on 60.86%, intestinal type in 39.10%. Dysplasia was not found. Endoscopic mucosal lesions were: finger-like projections 13/23 (56.52%), ulcers in five cases (21.73%), islands of columnar epithelium and circumferential extension in 2 each (8.69%), and stenosis in one (4.34%). The low frequency in this series could be attributed to a retrospective analysis. The high risk for developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus justifies prospectives trials in our country to verify the prevalence.
