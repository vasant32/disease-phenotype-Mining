In Barrett's esophagus the normal stratified squamous epithelium of esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium and other charcteristics of gastric mucosa. Barrett's esophagus has an increased tendency to bleed and is more prone to undergo malignant change. There are many procedures used to diagnose this entity, but only by serial and multiple esophageal mucosal biopsies can the diagnosis be confirmed. Harper et al (2) demonstrated an early and intense uptake of 99m Tc pertechnetate by the stomach in animals. Since the Barrett's esophagus is lined by gastric mucosa, pertechnetate scintigraphy was used as a screening procedure. The criteria for a postive scan was an area of increased uptake of technetium extending above the normal dense uptake of stomach configuration. Pertechnetate scintigraphy was performed in 4 patients with Barrett's esophagus and 6 controls with only one false negative result. Thus pertechnetate scintigraphy is a rapid, safe, and atraumatic screening procedure.
