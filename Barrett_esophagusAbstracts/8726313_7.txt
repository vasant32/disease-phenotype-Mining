Patients undergoing liver transplantation are predisposed to develop extrahepatic malignancies. It is also known that patients with predisposed conditions, such as Barrett's esophagus, have higher rates of esophageal carcinoma. We present here a patient who underwent liver transplantation, had Barrett's esophagus, and developed esophageal malignancy a short time after transplantation. Liver transplantation may be associated with acceleration of the precancerous condition and the development of malignancies.
