BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus is a metaplastic change in the esophageal lining with an increased risk for adenocarcinoma. Multiple endoscopic techniques have been applied in an effort to reverse Barrett's. This is a multicenter trial defining the efficacy and safety of multipolar electrocoagulation combined with high-dose acid inhibition. METHODS: Patients with a 2- to 6-cm segment of Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia were enrolled at 3 centers. They were treated with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and then with up to 6 sessions with electrocoagulation aimed at eliminating all the endoscopically apparent Barrett's. Four quadrant large-capacity biopsies every 2 cm were centrally assessed for residual intestinal metaplasia. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients reached the endpoint of failure of visual reversal of Barrett's after 6 treatment sessions or a 6-month follow-up after the last session. Eighty-five percent had visual reversal and 78% both visual and histologic reversal. Four patients had histologic evidence of residual intestinal metaplasia. Transient esophageal symptoms were common. One patient developed a stricture requiring dilation and one required overnight hospitalization for chest pain. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with 2 to 6 cm of nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus can be safely reversed with this combination therapy. Long-term follow-up will be necessary to document the durability of the new squamous epithelium.
