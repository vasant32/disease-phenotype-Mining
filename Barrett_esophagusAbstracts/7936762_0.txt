In the management of patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE) the definition of a sub-group of patients at high risk for malignant transformation of the metaplastic epithelium is important. Undoubtedly, the histological evaluation of dysplasia is the most important and objective parameter to identify a malignant transformation of BE. In order to obtain additional data a group of cell proliferation markers was applied in dysplastic lesions. We studied PCNA in a selected group of patients with BE. One hundred six biopsies were examined, referring to fifty five patients with BE, who were followed up for a period of at least one year (1-5 years). All patients showed one or more biopsies positive for dysplasia. PCNA was detected immunohistochemically on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded biopsies, and positive cells were evaluated in a crude percent count. Our results showed a remarkable number of PCNA positive cells in high grade dysplasia and a variable amount of PCNA positive cells in the others groups. In addition, there was an overlap in the number of positive cases between low grade dysplasia (30%), indefinite (33%) and negative (34%). Therefore, the assessment of S-phase cells correlated with the degree of dysplasia seems to be of limited practical use. Cell proliferation is probably affected by many factors and mainly inflammation.
