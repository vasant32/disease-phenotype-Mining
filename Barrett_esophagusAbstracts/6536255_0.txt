Eight cases of Barrett's esophagus are presented, six as a result of long-term reflux esophagitis, three of them with ulcer in gastric-like mucosa, two with stenosis. The Congo-Red test in three patients showed non-secretory pattern. They could twice confirm the epithelial change in previous normal esophageal mucosa, once after alkaline reflux esophagitis in a patient with total gastrectomy and esophagus-jejunostomy. Both surgical and medical treatment of reflux could afford relief of the symptoms but they produce no change in the ectopic mucosa.
