Adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia is increasing in incidence. The purpose of this study was to determine whether intestinal metaplasia of the esophagogastric and having a malignant potential junction can be considered as an ultra-short segment Barrett's esophagus. To study the epidemiologic and histological features of the intestinal metaplasia of esophagogastric junction two groups of patients were compared for the prevalence of this condition. Group 1 included 82 patients with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms et group 2 consisted of 82 healthy individuals. Both groups had two biopsy specimens taken from the esophagogastric junction. Histological evidence of intestinal metaplasia was defined as specialized columnar epithelium containing goblet cells staining with alcian blue at pH 2.5. Intestinal metaplasia of the esophagogastric junction was present in 12 patients in group 1 and 9 individuals in group 2. The global prevalence of this condition was 12.8% and there was not a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of this condition between the two groups. A significant difference could not be found when sex was considered. There was a significant association between this condition and older age (p = 0.01). Intestinal metaplasia of the esophagogastric junction and Barrett's esophagus do not have the same epidemiologic features. Therefore, we suggest that screening biopsy specimens of the esophagogastric junction be limited to study protocols at this time.
