 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Central obesity is a risk factor for GERD, Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adeno-carcinoma. Recent studies have suggested that adipocytokines are the possible link between adiposity and Barrett's carcinogenesis. To determine the adiponectin, resistin and leptin concentration as well as the central adiposity parameters in BE patients with and without intestinal metaplasia (IM) in comparison to GERD and healthy controls. METHODOLOGY: Total of 77 patients (30 patients with GERD, 26 BE with IM and 21 BE without IM) and 30 healthy controls were investigated for the central obesity parameters. Serum levels of adipocytokines were measured with ELISA. RESULTS: The serum concentration of adiponectin was significantly lower in BE compared to those in GERD and to controls (p<0.001). Levels of leptin was slightly higher in BE than in GERD and controls (NS). Level of resistin was significantly higher in GERD compared to both control and BE patients (p<0.001). Waist circumference, WHR and WTR were significantly higher in BE patients compared to GERD (p<0.001) and to control group (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Features of central obesity rather than BMI are associated with BE development. Adipokines may be important at the early step of BE development, before the IM occurrence.
