Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition caused by gastroesophageal reflux. Once developed, it can progress through varying grades of dysplasia to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Whilst it is well accepted that Barrett's esophagus is caused by gastroesophageal reflux, the molecular mechanisms of its pathogenesis and progression to cancer remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short segments of RNA that have been shown to control the expression of many human genes. They have been implicated in most cellular processes, and the role of miRNAs in disease development is becoming increasingly evident. Understanding altered miRNA expression is likely to help unravel the molecular mechanisms that underpin the development of Barrett's esophagus and its progression to cancer.
