Presentations by international experts from old and new worlds bordering the Atlantic Ocean revealed surprising similarities with respect to the diagnosis and management of patients with upper gastrointestinal disorders. It was agreed that Helicobacter pylori infection continues to play a key role in gastroduodenal disease and has a great impact on clinical management. However, testing and treatment strategies vary in patients affected by functional dyspepsia and those receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy including aspirin. Among patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), it was clear that we need to re-evaluate the validity of the classical concept of GERD as a progressive spectrum and instead focus on the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for producing the common symptom of heartburn and complications that occur in the three principle subsets of GERD patients: those with endoscopic negative reflux disease, erosive oesophagitis and Barrett's oesophagus. In addition, we need to be increasingly aware of the concept of extra-oesophageal manifestations of gastro-oesophageal reflux and the fact that GERD in adults often originates in childhood. In all these gastrointestinal disorders, proton pump inhibitor therapy has become the common thread either as a diagnostic tool or an effective short-term or long-term management strategy.
