Recent studies have suggested an association between dietary folate, and related B-vitamins, and risk for cancer, potentially mediated by the p53 tumor suppressor gene. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dietary folate and vitamin B(6) intake on p53 in the molecular pathogenesis of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC). For each participant, a structured questionnaire was used to obtain detailed sociodemographic and lifestyle risk factors, including diet, from which folate and vitamin B(6) intake were calculated. Risks for p53 mutations, p53 mutations at CpG sites, and p53 protein overexpression among EADC cases (n = 54) were calculated using logistic regression with dietary folate and vitamin B(6) intake as predictive variables, adjusting for age, gender, smoking, and alcohol consumption. No significant differences were found for patients with EADC who had p53 mutations (n = 21) compared with patients with wild-type p53 (n = 33) with respect to selected clinicopathologic variables (age, gender, tumor grade, stage, alcohol, or tobacco consumption) and dietary intake of folate or vitamin B(6). No statistically significant associations were seen between dietary folate and vitamin B(6) intake (highest vs. lowest quartiles) and p53 mutations, p53 mutations at CpG sites (n = 12), and p53 protein overexpression (n = 17). We conclude that dietary intake of folate and vitamin B(6) do not appear to have an effect on p53, suggesting alternative molecular mechanisms underlying esophageal adenocarcinogenesis.
