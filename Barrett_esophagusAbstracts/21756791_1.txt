 OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic values of GerdQ questionnaire, 24-h pH monitoring and 24-h impedance-pH monitoring for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to analyze the reflux patterns of Barrett's esophagus (BE), reflux esophagitis (RE) and non-erosive disease (NERD). METHODS: From June 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010, 205 GERD patients were included according to the Montreal consensus. All were surveyed by a GerdQ questionnaire and underwent 24-h impedance-pH monitoring. The diagnostic sensitivities of GerdQ, 24-h pH-DeM and 24-h IMP-pH were compared and the reflux pattern of BE, RE and NERD analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 205 GERD patients including 10 BE, 28 RE and 167 NERD were recruited. (1) The diagnostic rate of 24-h IMP-pH was 74.1%. It was significantly higher than that of GerdQ (51.7%) and 24-h pH-DeM (29.2%). (2) The diagnostic sensitivities of GerdQ and 24-h pH-DeM for BE and RE were higher than that for NERD. But there were no significant differences of 24-h IMP-pH for three types of GERD (70.0%, 82.1% and 73.1%). (3) There were positive correlations among the scores of GerdQ, pH-DeM scores and acid scores in IMP-pH (r = 0.242, P = 0.000; r = 0.182, P = 0.009 and r = 0.632, P = 0.000). (4) Added diagnostic values of IMP-pH were 58.5% and 74.5% respectively in patients who would have been missed by GerdQ and pH-DeM. (5) The detection rate and score of acid reflux in RE patients were higher than that of NERD [53.6% vs 23.4%, P < 0.05; 45.6 (35.0 - 67.5) vs 23.1 (9.3 - 35.0), P < 0.05]. But gas score and separate acid reflux were lower than that in NERD [17 (0 - 194) vs 30 (0 - 500), P < 0.05; 57.4% vs 28.6%, P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Acid reflux plays an important role in RE. The value of GerdQ and 24-h pH-DeM and 24-h IMP-pH monitoring were similar for the diagnosis of RE. Weak acid may be more important for BE and NERD patients than separate acid reflux. And 24-h IMP-pH monitoring has a distinct advantage in diagnosing these two types.
