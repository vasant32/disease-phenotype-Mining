 BACKGROUND: The relationship between diabetes, GERD symptoms and acid-related mucosal damage has not been well studied. AIMS: To better quantify risk of acid-related mucosal damage among patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: A prospective study using 10 sites from the Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative (CORI) National Endoscopy Database surveyed patients undergoing EGD by telephone within 30 days on medical history, symptoms and demographics. Varices and feeding tube indications were excluded. Acid-related damage was defined as any of these findings recorded in CORI: Barrett's esophagus; esophageal inflammation (unless non-acid-related etiology); healed ulcer, duodenal, gastric or esophageal ulcer; stricture; and mucosal abnormality with erosion or ulcer. RESULTS: Of 1,569 patients, 16% had diabetes, 95% being type 2. Diabetic patients were significantly more likely to be male, older and have a higher body mass index, and less likely to report frequent heartburn and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. No significant differences were found in acid reflux and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use between groups. In unadjusted analyses, diabetic patients had a similar risk for acid-related damage than non-diabetic patients (OR 1.09; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.42) which persisted after adjusting for gender, age, acid reflux, acid indication and PPI use (OR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.39). CONCLUSIONS: No difference in risk of acid-related mucosal damage was found, even after adjustment for potential confounders. Our data do not support the need for a lower threshold to perform endoscopy in diabetic patients.
