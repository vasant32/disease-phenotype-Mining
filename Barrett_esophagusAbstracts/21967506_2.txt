 BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have consistently reported inverse associations between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oesophageal adenocarcinoma, but few have investigated associations with the precursor lesion, Barrett's oesophagus. AIM: To investigate the relationship between NSAID use and risk of Barrett's oesophagus. METHODS: We conducted a large population-based case-control study that collected information on patterns of intake for aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs during the past 5 years and other exposures from 285 patients with nondysplastic Barrett's oesophagus, 108 patients with dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus, and two separate control groups: 313 endoscopy patients with acute inflammatory changes ('inflammation controls') and 644 population controls. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Use of aspirin was not associated with nondysplastic Barrett's oesophagus when compared with population (OR=1.01, 95% CI 0.71-1.43) or inflammation controls (OR=1.16, 95% CI 0.80-1.68). Whereas we observed significant risk reductions for use of non-aspirin NSAIDs when nondysplastic Barrett's oesophagus cases were compared with population controls (OR=0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.97), the effect was weaker and nonsignificant when cases were compared with inflammation controls (OR=0.82, 95% CI 0.57-1.18), and no dose-response effects were present in either analysis. We found no evidence that aspirin or non-aspirin NSAID use conferred risk reductions for dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus, regardless of the control series. We excluded effect modification by known risk factors as an explanation for these null findings. CONCLUSIONS: We found little support for an inverse association between use of NSAIDs and Barrett's oesophagus. The question of whether or not these medications prevent the onset of Barrett's oesophagus remains open.
