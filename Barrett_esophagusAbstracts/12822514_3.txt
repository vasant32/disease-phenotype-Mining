We examined the effects of exisulind (sulindac sulfone) and a potent derivative CP248 on the Barrett's esophagus (BE)-related adenocarcinoma cell lines Seg-1 and Bic-1, and on HCE7 esophageal squamous carcinoma cells. Marked growth inhibition and apoptosis occurred in all cell lines with IC50 values of 100-300 microM for exisulind and 100 nM for CP248. Bic-1 and HCE7 cells were more sensitive to the growth inhibitory properties of exisulind. Treatment of all cell lines with CP248 for 24 h increased the proportion of cells in mitosis. Exisulind had no effect on cell-cycle progression. Treatment with either compound induced rapid activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), suggesting that JNK1 activation plays a role in the induction of apoptosis by these compounds. Only Seg-1 cells expressed a detectable basal level of cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), providing further evidence that cox-2 is not the critical target for the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of these compounds. Cellular levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) increased approximately five-fold in all cell lines after 24 h of treatment with either compound. These studies provide support for the use of exisulind in BE chemoprevention trials, and of exisulind or CP248 in the therapy of patients with esophageal carcinoma.
