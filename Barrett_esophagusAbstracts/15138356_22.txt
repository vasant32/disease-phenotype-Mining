Squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most frequent histological subtype in esophageal cancer, although the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is increasing faster than any other malignancy in the western world. New developments in the understanding of molecular mechanisms in esophageal cancer comprise analysis of the genetic tumor profiles by CGH (comparative genomic hybridization), the detection of tumor suppressor gene inactivation, and the analysis of proto-oncogenes. Especially the inactivation of the p53 gene proved to be of particular importance for the development of esophageal cancer. Also p15 and p16 have been identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer by influencing the cyclin kinase inhibitor cascade and DNA mismatch repair processes. Amplification of cyclin D1 results in growth advantage for tumor cells and enhances tumorigenesis; gene amplification and overexpression of cyclin D1 were frequently demonstrated especially in ESCC. Regarding the dysplasia-metaplasia-carcinoma sequence of Barrett's esophagus, inhibition of apoptosis by overexpression of bcl-2 proteins occurs as an early event.
