OBJECTIVE. We re-evaluated a cohort of patients referred for reflux symptoms and objectively diagnosed with pathological reflux, with the purpose of clarifying the course of conservatively treated gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). MATERIAL AND METHODS. All consecutive patients with GERD diagnosed between 1984 and 1988 showing pathologic 24-h pH-metry in the interval 3.8-10% and without any previous surgery in the gastroesophageal tract were assessed for further follow-up. A total of 40 evaluable patients were followed in the years 2007-08 with endoscopy, manometry, 24-h pH-metry, Helicobacter pylori assessment and the self-administered questionnaires the GERD Impact Scale, the Reflux Disease Questionnaire, the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia and the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 Health Survey. Baseline data from the 1980s were retrieved and compared with the evaluations conducted at follow-up. RESULTS. At follow-up 20.7 years (range 18.8-23.5 years) after referral, the study population showed more use of acid suppressants (p = 0.007) and increasing prevalences of esophagitis (p = 0.001) and Barrett's esophagus (p = 0.002). Esophagitis was seen in 16/40 patients (40%) at baseline and in 29/40 (72.5%) at follow-up. No significant deterioration was seen at follow-up in manometry data and in most pH data. Patients with esophagitis (ERD) were less likely to have a positive H. pylori test (hazard ratio 0.054; p = 0.002) than non-erosive (NERD) patients. Symptom evaluations showed significantly lower quality of life in the ERD group. CONCLUSIONS. After 20 years a considerable part of the cohort still experienced symptoms of reflux and showed endoscopic progression, although no significant deteriorations were seen in manometry data and in most pH-metry data. H. pylori infection was inversely associated with erosive esophagitis and this supports the hypothesis that H. pylori colonization is a protective factor against GERD.
