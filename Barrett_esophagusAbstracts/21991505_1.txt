Objective. This study was undertaken to gain an insight into the relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, Barrett's esophagus and reflux esophagitis in an area of exceptionally low prevalence of H. pylori infection. Methods. A total of 1895 consecutive upper endoscopies performed between January 2005 and July 2007 were reviewed. 120 cases of columnar-lined esophagus and endoscopic esophagitis were evaluated. H. pylori infection was determined using the urease test and/or histology. Results. The rate of endoscopic esophagitis was 5.49% (80 Malays, 24 non-Malays) while histological reflux esophagitis was found in 3.75% (56 Malays, 15 non-Malays). Barrett's esophagus was present in 0.79% (11 Malays, 4 non-Malays). H. pylori infection was present in 8/120 or 6.67% subjects. Conclusion. The low rate of Barrett's esophagus in this population does not support the hypothesis that the absence of H. pylori infection is more than a minor risk factor for Barrett's esophagus.
