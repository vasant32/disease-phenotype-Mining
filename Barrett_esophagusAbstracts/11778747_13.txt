Endoscopic mucosal resection of the esophagus was found to be safe and easy to perform. Efforts must be made to detect early m1 to m2 cancers, which are indicated for EEMR. It is necessary to perform periodic endoscopic examination. During endoscopic examination, it is important to wash the inside of the esophagus with water and perform careful observation. Also, in high-risk patients and patients with abnormalities, such as erythema, turbidity, or hypervascularity, iodine staining should be performed frequently. Patients at high risk for esophageal cancer include (1) men more than 55 years old who are heavy smokers and drinkers; (2) patients with cancer of the head and neck region; and (3) individuals with a family history of cancer and those with achalasia, corrosive esophagitis, or Barrett's esophagus.
