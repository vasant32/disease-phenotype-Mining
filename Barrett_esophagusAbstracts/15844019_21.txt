BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of residual high-grade dysplasia or early cancer (HGD/EC) after endoscopic resection in Barrett esophagus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study patients were separated into group A, with proven residual HGD/EC, and group B with possible HGD/EC (positive lateral margins in the endoscopic resection specimen, without HGD/EC in the remaining Barrett esophagus). PDT treatment consisted of 5-aminolevulinic (5-ALA) photosensitization (40 mg/kg) followed by illumination of the Barrett esophagus with a total light dose of 100 J/cm (2). Complete remission was defined as the absence of HGD/EC in biopsies taken in two consecutive follow-up endoscopies. The percentage regression of Barrett esophagus, as well as the recurrence rate of HGD/EC, was calculated. RESULTS: 20 patients underwent PDT (group A, 11; group B, 9). Mild complications were seen in 4/26 procedures. The overall success rate was 15/20 (75 %). There was a significant difference in success rate between group A (55 %) and group B (100 %); P = 0.03. All patients had residual Barrett esophagus after PDT; the median regression percentage was 50 % (IQR 25 - 70 %). Recurrence of HGD/EC occurred in four patients (two each in groups A and B) after a median follow up of 30 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this selected group of patients, the addition of 5-ALA-PDT after endoscopic resection for HGD/EC had a disappointing success rate in patients who had residual HGD/EC after endoscopic resection. Most patients undergoing 5-ALA-PDT have residual Barrett mucosa after PDT and 5-ALA-PDT does not seem to prevent recurrences during follow-up.
