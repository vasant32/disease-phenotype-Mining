Porfimer sodium photodynamic therapy (ps-PDT) for Barrett's esophagus is a powerful endoscopic treatment that can eliminate high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and Barrett's mucosa and reduce the risk of development of cancer in these patients. Ps-PDT typically results in destruction of Barrett's esophagus in the majority of the treated area. However, residual small island of Barrett's mucosa may persist after PDT. Therefore, adjuvant thermal ablation should be available during follow-up endoscopies for ablation of residual islands of Barrett's mucosa. PDT should be applied concurrent with effective proton pump inhibitor therapy. This article provides a practical guide for application of porfimer sodium balloon PDT for management of Barrett's esophagus with HGD. Recommendations are provided for patient selection and screening, delivery of PDT to include light dosimetry, methodology for follow-up endoscopies, as well as discussing the potential side effects and complications.
