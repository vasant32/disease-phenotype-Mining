A case of mucoepidermoid or adenosquamous carcinoma arising from the mucous epithelium of a Barrett's esophagus is presented. Immunohistologic examination demonstrated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in both the glandular and squamous components, but keratin only in the latter. Although mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the esophagus is believed to arise from submucosal glands, heterotopic gastric surface epithelium may also give rise to this uncommon neoplasm.
