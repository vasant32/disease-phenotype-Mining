The previous paradigm that Barrett's is an irreversible premalignant lesion has recently been challenged by a proliferation of reports documenting elimination of Barrett's by a variety of endoscopic techniques. Whether Barrett's is entirely eliminated is unknown as endoscopic biopsy samples the surface of the epithelium only. Numerous reports document underlying specialised columnar epithelium in many of these trials. Until now there have been no reports of pathological examination of the entire oesophagus as a specimen. This case documents complete elimination of intestinal metaplasia from the oesophagus and supports the biological plausibility of these research techniques.
