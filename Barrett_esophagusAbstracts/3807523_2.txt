Barrett's esophagus is a precancerous stage as a malign degeneration occurs in about 15%. According to prospective studies the risk of development of cancer is 30 to 42 times higher than in the normal population. Risk factors for malign degeneration, which mostly concerns white males, are abuse of alcohol or nicotine and chronic gastroesophageal reflux. Antireflux surgery is only indicated in Barrett's esophagus in combination with active reflux esophagitis. The uncomplicated Barrett's esophagus should be controlled by endoscopy. The adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus has to be considered as an esophageal carcinoma. Due to its metastatic spread in mostly aboral direction it can be treated by blunt dissection of the esophagus.
