There can be few medical conditions that have been surrounded by as much confusion about their definition or terminology as columnar-lined esophagus (CLE); approximately 30 different terms and eponyms have been used to describe this condition. The history of this condition can be divided into five stages: (i) descriptive stage, 1906-1950; (ii) "argument" stage, 1950-1963; (iii) "significant" stage, 1963-1973; (iv) surveillance stage, 1973-1990; and (v) refined research stage, 1990-present. The use of the eponym "Barrett's" to describe CLE is not justified from a historical point of view. Lining of the lower esophagus by columnar epithelium was termed "Barrett's esophagus" after the presentation by Barrett in 1957. Although this finding has been attributed to Barrett, the work of others, including Tileston, Lortat-Jacob, and Allison and Johnstone, preceded Barrett's description. The historical aspects of CLE were reviewed to show how little Norman Barrett had contributed to the core concept of this condition in comparison to the contributions of other investigators, particularly the contribution of Philip Allison. Based on many discussed historical facts, we are not in favor of retaining the term "Barrett's esophagus" and we propose that CLE be henceforth referred to as "columnar-lined esophagus".
