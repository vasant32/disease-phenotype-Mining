The aim of this preliminary study conducted in a few cases was the retrospective evaluation of the effects of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication on oesophageal intestinal metaplasia. Seventy-seven patients with hiatal hernia underwent digital videofluorography, endoscopy with biopsies, motility studies and 24-h oesophageal pH-monitoring. On the basis of the results of the diagnostic procedures and considering the patients' ages and response to proton-pump inhibitor treatment, 8 patients underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication; in 5 cases intestinal metaplasia was present at histopathological examination. Two of these had Barrett's oesophagus at endoscopy and intestinal metaplasia was associated with low-grade dysplasia in both at histology; the other 3 did not present a columnar mucosa at endoscopy and 1 had low-grade dysplasia. In all 5 patients, at 1 year postoperative histopathological control, disappearance or decrease of metaplastic epithelium and regression of dysplasia were noted, with excellent results in terms of reflux symptoms at clinical control. On the basis of these preliminary data, it is our opinion that antireflux surgery is not only a suitable treatment in the management of Barrett's oesophagus but also has a favourable effect on intestinal metaplasia regression when a normal oesophageal mucosa is present.
