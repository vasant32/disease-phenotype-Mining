We screened 18 specimens of Barrett adenocarcinoma for genetic alterations using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to analyze DNA copy number changes. The most common gains were at 20q (56%) and 17q (39%). High-level amplifications were observed in the same chromosomes. The most common losses were in chromosomes 4 (22%) and 5 (22%). Other recurrent changes were gains of chromosomes 8, 10q, and 13. We compared the copy number changes in Barrett adenocarcinoma and those previously reported in the intestinal type of stomach carcinoma. The similarities we found suggest a common molecular pathogenesis, whereas dissimilarities seen between Barrett adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are in keeping with a well-known different etiology.
