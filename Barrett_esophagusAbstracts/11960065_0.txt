 GOALS AND BACKGROUND: To assess whether prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori has adverse effects on gastritis. STUDY: We studied 34 H. pylori-positive individuals with reflux esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, or nonulcer dyspepsia. Half of them were on maintenance treatment with PPIs (mean, 8 years) and half were not.H. pylori and CagA status were tested serologically. Gastric biopsies were classified histopathologically by the updated Sydney classification. RESULTS: Proton pump inhibitors in H. pylori gastritis are associated with significantly less antral inflammation and lower H. pylori density, regardless of CagA status. There was a tendency toward more antral atrophy in patients with the CagA strain who were undergoing maintenance treatment with PPIs (p = 0.08), but there was an opposite tendency in CagA-negative individuals (p = 0.08). Intestinal metaplasia was seen more frequently in CagA-positive, treated individuals (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that CagA status is important in the progression to atrophy and that maintenance treatment with PPIs accelerate this progression, while reducing inflammatory infiltration.
