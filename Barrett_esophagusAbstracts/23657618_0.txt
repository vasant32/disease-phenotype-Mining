Modern high-resolution video endoscopes allow detailed examination of the esophageal mucosa and diagnosis of early neoplastic changes in the gastrointestinal tract. Whereas Barrett's esophagus is a precancerous condition that can develop into adenocarcinoma, there is no defined precancerous lesion for squamous cell carcinoma. Various diseases are associated with the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Chromoendoscopy has become an established method in the diagnostic work-up for better visualization of early neoplasia. If Barrett's esophagus is present, acetic acid spraying or virtual chromoendoscopy can be used to accentuate the display of superficial gyriform structures in the mucosa. The gold standard for detecting squamous cell carcinoma is still the use of Lugol solution. When early neoplasia is suspected, diagnostic endoscopic resection should be performed. This allows precise histological assessment of the tumor. Early diagnosis of neoplastic changes in the esophagus provides patients not only with the option of curative therapy but also with a good quality of life through preservation of the esophagus.
