Congenital pouch colon (CPC), an unusual high anorectal malformation in which a varying length of colon is replaced by a dilated pouch, has appeared in a number of case reports and series published in the English literature. There is only one case report of its association with prune belly syndrome (also known as triad syndrome, Eagle-Barrett syndrome, and abdominal muscle deficiency syndrome). We report the description and management of this rare association in a male neonate with CPC, prune belly syndrome, and congenital megalourethra.
