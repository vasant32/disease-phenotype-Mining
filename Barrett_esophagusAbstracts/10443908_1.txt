Appropriate use of modern medical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), particularly proton pump inhibitors, should result in effective control of symptoms in most GERD patients. Possible causes of poor response to GERD treatment include: a non-compliant patient, lack of appropriate therapy or insufficient dose, or an incorrect diagnosis. Endoscopy plays an important role in the management of GERD and other associated conditions. If the presence of esophagitis is detected then this confirms a diagnosis of GERD. Endoscopy can identify the presence of Barrett's esophagus, with a biopsy taken to confirm intestinal metaplasia. Endoscopy should ideally be used in patients with chronic GERD symptoms (persisting for 3 years or more), in those aged over 40, and particularly in Caucasian males who are at high risk of developing Barrett's esophagus. pH monitoring can also be used to confirm the diagnosis of GERD. It also has a role where the endoscopy findings are normal and in patients with atypical symptoms, such as chest pain, asthma/cough or hoarseness. It is a useful tool to document effectiveness of GERD treatment. Esophageal and gastric pH monitoring during treatment with acid suppressing therapy will confirm the control of gastric acid and the absence of continued reflux. Similarly, pH monitoring can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of antireflux surgery.
