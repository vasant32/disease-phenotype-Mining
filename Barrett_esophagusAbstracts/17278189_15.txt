 AIM: To investigate the role of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expressions in the development and progression of reflux esophagitis-Barrett's metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence in the esophagus. METHODS: GST and MMP-9 expressions were analyzed in 51 paraffin-embedded tissue samples by immunohistochemistry including patients with reflux esophagitis (n = 7), Barrett's metaplasia (n = 14), Barrett and esophagitis (n = 8), Barrett and dysplasia (n = 7), esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 8) and a control group without any histological changes (n = 7). Immunostaining was determined semiquantitatively. Statistical analysis with one-way ANOVA, LSD test and correlation analysis were performed. P value of < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: GST expression was significantly higher while MMP-9 expression was significantly lower in control group compared to Barrett's metaplasia and the other groups. No major changes were observed between Barrett, esophagitis, and Barrett and concomitant esophagitis. Barrett and concomitant dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma revealed a significant lower expression of GST and higher levels of MMP-9 compared to all other groups. Adenocarcinoma showed almost no expression of GST and significantly higher levels of MMP-9 than Barrett and concomitant dysplasia. Alterations of GST and MMP-9 were inversely correlated (r = -0.82). CONCLUSION: Decreased GST and increased expression of MMP-9 in Barrett's metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence as compared to normal tissue suggest their association with esophageal tumorigenesis. Loss of GST and gain of MMP-9 in Barrett with dysplasia compared to non-dysplastic metaplasia indicate that these alterations may be early events in carcinogenesis. Quantification of these parameters in Barrett's esophagus might be useful to identify patients at higher risk for progression to cancer.
