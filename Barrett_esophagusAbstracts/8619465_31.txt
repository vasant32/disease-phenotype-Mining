BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented a significantly better we weight loss for gastric bypass (GBP) than for vertical banded gastroplasty (VGB). Additional problems associated with VBG include intractable vomiting or gastroesophageal (GE) reflux, intragastric migration of the polypropylene band, staple line disruption, or inadequate weight loss due to excessive ingestion of high-calorie liquid or soft carbohydrates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight morbidly obese patients underwent conversion from VBG to GBP for either weight-loss failure (15) or complications of VBG (43), including 2 who where referred with anastomotic leaks and peritonitis, 3 with band erosion, 15 with staple line disruption, and 23 with stomal stenosis, of whom 6 had severe GE reflux, with a Barrett's esophagus in 1. RESULTS: Percentage of excess weight loss in the 53 patients followed up for at least 1 year after conversion increased from 36% +/- 24% to 67% +/- 18%, and in the 15 "sweets eaters" from 20% +/- 19% to 70% +/- 19% (both P <0.001), was equal to weight loss after primary GBP, and was reasonably constant over 8 years in those patients who could be contacted for follow-up, although average follow-up after 5 years was only 45% All patients had resolution of GE reflux symptoms immediately after surgery and for at least 1 year or at last contact. Complications of conversion included 2 anastomotic leaks with major wound infections (1 in a referred patient requiring emergency subtotal gastrectomy following a VBG leak), 3 staple line disruptions (2 subclinical), 3 small-bowel obstructions, and 20 marginal ulcers or stomal stenoses (all responded to endoscopic balloon dilation or acid reduction therapy). Hemoglobin, calcium, and vitamin B12 levels remained within normal levels with prophylactic supplementation in patients who returned for follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the efficacy of conversion to GBP in morbidly obese patients with a failed or complicated VBG.
