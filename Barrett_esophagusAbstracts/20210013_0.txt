A protocol is suggested of complex diagnosis and treatment of Barrett's esophagus using sparing endoscopic removal of Barrett's epithelium in combination with surgery and medicinal antireflux therapy. Eighty-three patients were diagnosed and treated for hernia of esophageal foramen of the diaphragm and gastro-esophageal reflux complicated by Barrett's esophagus. Ninety-two percent of patients receiving our four-component treatment were cured; no recurrent esophageal adenocarcinoma was reported during the 56.7 +/- 2.4 month follow-up. Conversely, in patients receiving three-component treatment, efficacy was 56%; esophageal adenocarcinoma was reported in 3 (12%).
