The advent of videoendoscopes showed the very minute details of the gastrointestinal tract. Three American and five Japanese endoscopists who are experts and founders in their original EMR for the entire gastrointestinal tract were invited. All of them have tremendous experience with EMR. One can appreciate the technique and pitfalls of EMR through their data analyses based on a large number of cases. In western countries, early esophageal cancers arising from Barrett's esophagus seem to be the most likely candidates for EMR. It is hoped that these techniques aid the reader's endoscopic practice and provide a better quality of life to patients.
