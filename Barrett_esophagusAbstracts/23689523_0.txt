 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a clinical need for biomarkers that can improve diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification of esophageal lesions. Here we review the current literature and highlight the most important, recent advancements in biomarkers as a supplement to histopathology for management of patients with Barrett's esophagus. RECENT FINDINGS: A prospective cohort study in Northern Ireland shows that a small panel of biomarkers (low-grade dysplasia, abnormal DNA ploidy and Aspergillus oryzae lectin) can identify patients at high risk for developing high-grade dysplasia or cancer. Recent research in molecular imaging shows promise for molecular probes in endoscopy, using fluorescently labeled peptides or lectins to identify dysplastic areas of Barrett's epithelium. Based on the current literature, p53 immunostaining is starting to be adopted by some centers as an adjunct to histopathology diagnosis for dysplasia. SUMMARY: The evidence base for the use of biomarkers is increasing and it appears that panels may have superior diagnostic and predictive power over single, candidate biomarkers. Prior to clinical implementation, biomarkers must overcome significant barriers including the need for large-scale prospective validation trials, and the limited ability of clinical laboratories to process and analyze complex biomarker assays.
