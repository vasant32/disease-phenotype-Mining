A case of a carcinosarcoma which developed in a Barrett's oesophagus is presented. The tumour consisted of an adenocarcinoma and a spindle cell sarcoma. Immunohistological examinations demonstrated vimentin positivity in the sarcomatous portion with a negative reaction for keratin. Immunohistological and histological findings did not rule out the possibility of a double or collision tumour in this case.
