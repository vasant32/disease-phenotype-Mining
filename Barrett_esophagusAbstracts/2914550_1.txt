The presence in the esophagus of three distinct entities--Barrett's mucosa, Crohn's disease, and adenocarcinoma--is a very rare finding. In a 60-year-old man with a long history of heartburn and recently developed dysphagia, narrowing of the distal esophagus was found to be related to the presence of Barrett's mucosa. A short time later repeated endoscopy revealed adenocarcinoma in this area. The patient underwent esophagogastrectomy and died a few days after surgery. Findings in the surgical specimen and upon autopsy were consistent with isolated Crohn's disease of the distal esophagus as well as with intramucosal adenocarcinoma. Analysis of the data available in the literature reveals that Crohn's disease of the esophagus, although rare, clearly possesses some definite characteristics of its own. It is suggested that the presence of these three features in a single patient constitutes no more than a chance coexistence.
