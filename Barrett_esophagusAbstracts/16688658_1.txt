The current guidelines of the German Society for Digestive Diseases (DGVS) endoscopy recommends for patients representing with reflux symptoms. In daily routine as well as in Guidelines from other countries and international guidelines, however, a symptom-based strategy for the management of patients with reflux disease is favoured. Since either strategies is dependent on specific clinical findings, neither can be recommended. The preference for one or the other strategy depends on the prevalence of so-called alarm symptoms, risk factors for a reflux carcinoma or Barrett's metaplasia, demographic factors, e. g., age and gender, patient's wish and initial response to empirical therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). However, most patients with characteristic reflux symptoms without any alarm symptoms and/or other risk factors can be safely managed with a symptom-based strategy in acute and long-term care.
