Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a common chronic disease in the older population. Because of the cumulative effects of acid reflux and delayed gastric emptying, the older adult is at risk for such complications as peptic strictures, esophagitis, and Barrett's esophagus. Providing information on the current care modes (lifestyle, dietary, pharmacologic, and surgical interventions) will help identify relevant solutions and help the older adult generate alternative safe and effective solutions to manage the disease. Many people struggle to change their lives and may need assistance to break old habits.
