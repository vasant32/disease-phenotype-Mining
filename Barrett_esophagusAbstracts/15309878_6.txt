The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus and erosive esophagitis in a group of patients undergoing upper endoscopy for dyspepsia. Computerized endoscopy records were retrospectively evaluated to identify patients who underwent upper endoscopy for dyspepsia. Objective findings were recorded, including the presence of Barrett's esophagus, erosive esophagitis, and peptic ulcer disease. Among 264 patients, Barrett's esophagus was found in 16 (6.1%). The mean length of Barrett's was 2.0 cm, and the majority (81.3%) was short segment. Erosive esophagitis was found in 62 patients (23.%), and peptic ulcer disease was found in 25 patients (9.5%). Approximately 30% of patients undergoing endoscopy for dyspepsia had esophageal lesions. The prevalence of Barrett's in this population was 6%. Based on these results, a trial of acid suppression may benefit a third of patients with dyspepsia. Current screening practices for Barrett's in reflux patients alone may need to be reevaluated.
