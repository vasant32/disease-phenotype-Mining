 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Familial clusters of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) have been reported. This study evaluates the history of cancer in BE patients families. METHODS: In two years, patients with BE (272), esophagitis (456) and controls (517) were recruited in 12 Italian Endoscopy Units. Cancer family history in first-degree (FD) relatives was determined by a questionnaire. RESULTS: Approximately 53% of BE, 51% of esophagitis, and 48% of controls had at least one relative affected by any type of malignancy. Probands with at least one esophageal or gastric (E/G) cancer-affected relative showed a BE risk which was at least eighty-five percent higher than that of probands without affected relatives. The relative risk of BE was 4.18, 95% CL=0.76-23.04 if a FD relative had early (mean age â‰¤ 50 years) onset E/G cancer compared to late onset E/G cancer. CONCLUSION: In this sample there was no evidence that a family history of cancer was associated with the diagnosis of BE. An intriguing result was the association between the occurrence of E/G cancers at earlier ages (< 50 years) among BE relatives with respect the control group. This could suggest a genetic contribution in onset of these tumors, but the sample was too small to demonstrate a significant association. Further exploration of family history of E/G cancer and a diagnosis of BE in larger samples is warranted.
