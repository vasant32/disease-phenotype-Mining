BACKGROUND: High-frequency catheter ultrasound (C-EUS) probes provide high resolution images of the gastrointestinal tract. Their use in the esophagus is limited by the requirement for a water-filled lumen for good acoustical coupling. We have developed a system using a condom that provides a continuous column of water for high resolution C-EUS imaging of the esophagus. METHODS: Nine patients underwent condom C-EUS for evaluation of esophageal mucosal and submucosal tumors. A standard latex condom was attached to a 2-channel endoscope and filled with water after esophageal intubation. A 20 MHz C-EUS probe placed within the water-filled condom was used to characterize all lesions. RESULTS: The condom C-EUS system provided a 360 degree, high resolution image throughout the length of the esophagus without air artifact and without the risk of aspiration associated with filling the esophageal lumen with water. Complete imaging of the tumor was obtained in all cases, and no additional C-EUS procedures were required. The condom C-EUS was subjectively rated superior overall in comparison to standard C-EUS by 4 independent endosonographers. CONCLUSIONS: Condom C-EUS is a new method of high resolution imaging of the esophagus. This method provides a contained column of water within the esophagus that improves image quality and ease of use and may reduce the risk of aspiration.
