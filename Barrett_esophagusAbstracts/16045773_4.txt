AIMS: To evaluate proliferative patterns in metaplastic columnar epithelia of the oesophagus, classified as oxynto-cardiac (n = 43), cardiac (n = 45) intestinal without dysplasia (n = 41), dysplastic intestinal epithelium (n = 25), and adenocarcinoma (n = 15) by Ki67 immunohistochemistry. METHODS AND RESULTS: Abnormal patterns of Ki67 immunoreactivity were classified into (i) expanded proliferation, characterized by increased levels of Ki67 expression in the deep and mid third of the foveolar pit; and (ii) aberrant proliferation, characterized by positive staining in the surface epithelium and superficial third of the foveolar pit. A significant step-wise increase in the frequency of expanded proliferation was seen in oxynto-cardiac, cardiac, intestinal and dysplastic intestinal epithelium indicative of increasing levels of damage. Aberrant proliferation was absent in oxynto-cardiac mucosa, present at a low and similar level in cardiac, intestinal and low-grade dysplastic epithelia and at a significantly increased frequency in high-grade dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that oxynto-cardiac mucosa occurs in a low damage environment and intestinal metaplasia in a high damage environment along the length of the columnar lined oesophageal segment. Aberrant proliferative patterns with Ki67 staining are not useful in differentiating reactive epithelia from low-grade dysplasia, but may prove useful in the diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia.
