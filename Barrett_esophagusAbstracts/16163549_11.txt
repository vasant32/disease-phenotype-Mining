 PURPOSE: We investigated the prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the p16 gene (C540G) and the cyclin D1 gene (G870A), both known to regulate function in G1 arrest and therefore, may play an important role in carcinogenesis. METHODS: Using PCR based restriction fragment length polymorphism and single strand conformational polymorphism, we determined single nucleotide exchanges in the p16 and cyclin D1 genes among 56 esophageal adenocarcinomas (ADC) arising in Barrett's esophagus, 95 cardiac gastric ADC, and in 191 distal gastric ADC. The allelic frequencies were compared to a control group of 253 healthy blood donors. RESULTS: The C/G genotype of p16 was identified in 10.4% of esophageal carcinomas, 13.3% of cardiac carcinomas, and in 14.1% of gastric carcinomas, compared to 17.4% in the healthy control group. All other cases showed the C/C wildtype, as no homozygous G/G nucleotide exchange was detected in the group of cancer patients or in the control group. In esophageal cancer, cyclin D1 G/G genotype was found 28.6%, A/G in 46.4%, and A/A in 25.0%. In cardiac carcinoma, frequency of cyclin D1 genotype was 27.4% for G/G, 57.9% for A/G, and 14.7% for AA. In distal gastric carcinoma, both homozygous genotypes (G/G and A/A) had a frequency of 15.2% each, while the heterozygous A/G genotype occurred in 69.6% of patients. The control group displayed 24.9% G/G, 53.8% A/G, and 21.3% A/A genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that frequencies of p16 or cyclin D1 polymorphisms in gastric and esophageal ADC do not differ significantly from the healthy control group. Therefore, these polymorphisms are unlikely to be associated with risk of ADC of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
