The molecular pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that at a phenotypic level, the metaplastic process begins with the transformation of squamous epithelium in the distal esophagus to cardiac mucosa, which subsequently becomes intestinalized. The homeobox gene Cdx-2 has been shown to be an important transcriptional regulator of embryonic differentiation and maintenance of adult intestinal type epithelium. We hypothesized that Cdx-2 gene expression levels increase with the phenotypic transformation of normal squamous mucosa to the intestinalized columnar mucosa of Barrett's esophagus. Endoscopic biopsies were obtained at the gastroesophageal junction in patients with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease and classified according to histology: normal squamous mucosa (n = 62), cardiac mucosa (n = 19), oxynto-cardiac mucosa (n = 14), and intestinal metaplasia (n = 15). Duodenal biopsies (n = 26) served as the columnar control. After laser capture microdissection and RNA isolation, gene expression levels of Cdx-2 were measured in each tissue type by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Consistent with its known function, Cdx-2 gene expression levels were highest in duodenal mucosa and nearly absent in squamous epithelium. There was a stepwise increase in Cdx-2 gene expression from cardiac to Barrett's epithelium (P < 0.001). Expression levels of Cdx-2 in cardiac and oxynto-cardiac mucosa were 40-70 times higher and Barrett's mucosa 400 times higher than that found in squamous epithelium. Relative expression of the homeobox gene Cdx-2, known to induce differentiation of intestinal type epithelium, increases in a stepwise fashion during the phenotypic transformation of distal esophageal squamous mucosa to cardiac columnar mucosa and to the intestinalized columnar mucosa of Barrett's esophagus. Therefore, Cdx-2 may be a potential biomarker to detect the early transition to Barrett's esophagus.
