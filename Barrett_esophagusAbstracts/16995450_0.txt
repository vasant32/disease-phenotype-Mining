 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Esophageal cancer in achalasia is often diagnosed in the advanced stage, which makes for a poor prognosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the macroscopic and histological features of the esophageal mucosa in order to improve the early detection of cancer. METHODOLOGY: We studied the macroscopic features of esophageal mucosa using Lugol's solution and compared them with histological analysis of the entire mucosa in 20 esophagectomy specimens resected for achalasia. Intraepithelial neoplasia, when detected, was selected for DNA ploidy analysis through static cytometry. RESULTS: Macroscopically, the mucosa showed opacification and/or diffuse irregularities in 19 specimens. Advanced squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed in 2 cases. Using Lugol, the esophageal mucosa acquired irregular brownish color. Clear unstained areas were circumscribed in 5 esophagi. They were macroscopically defined as ulcer, neoplasia (2 cases) and mucosal irregularities (2 cases). The histological analysis showed ulcer, squamous cell carcinoma (2 cases), Barrett's esophagus and esophagitis, respectively. The histological study of the stained mucosa revealed minute foci of DNA aneuploid intraepithelial neoplasia in 4 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Macroscopic examination using Lugol failed to identify minute foci of early carcinoma. The stained mucosa does not exclude the esophageal cancer risk in achalasia.
