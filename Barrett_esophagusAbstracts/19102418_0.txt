 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Barrett's epithelium is currently believed to be related to acid gastroesophageal reflux. The aim was to determine the role of pancreatic-biliary reflux in the genesis of Barrett's epithelium. METHODOLOGY: The study population comprised 1055 cases (606 men and 449 women; median age, 67 years) who had undergone an upper endoscopy at the Gastroenterology Division of Yokohama City University Hospital between August 2005 and July 2006. The study population was composed of 869 cases with intact stomachs and 186 cases with distal-gastrectomies. The presence and the progression of Barrett's epithelium were diagnosed based on the Prague C & M Criteria. The correlations of clinical factors, including distal-gastrectomy, with the presence and the progression of Barrett's epithelium were examined. RESULTS: The study demonstrated that 42.2% of the total population was diagnosed to have Barrett's epithelium and, in 12.6% of the cases with Barrett's epithelium, the progression of Barrett's epithelium was observed during the median 72 month followup. A distal gastrectomy was not significantly correlated with either the incidence or progression of Barrett's epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: This lack of association between gastric surgery and Barrett's epithelium suggests that pancreatic-biliary reflux with limited acid is not sufficient for the genesis of Barrett's epithelium.
