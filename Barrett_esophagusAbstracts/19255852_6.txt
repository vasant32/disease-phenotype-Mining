 AIMS: The Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative database was used to evaluate ethnic trends in complicated reflux disease and suspected Barrett's esophagus among various racial groups. METHODS: Endoscopic findings for procedures performed January 2000-December 2005 for any indication and for reflux-related indications were reviewed by racial group. RESULTS: Of 280,075 procedures examined, Hispanics were the most likely to have esophagitis (Hispanic 19.6%, white 17.3%, black 15.8%, Asian/Pacific Islander 9.5%, P-value<0.0001), and white subjects were most likely to have suspected BE (white 5.0%, Hispanic 2.9%, Asian/Pacific Islander 1.8%, black 1.5%, P-value<0.0001). Endoscopies performed for reflux-related indications had similar trends for esophagitis and esophageal stricture. Among reflux/Barrett's screening procedures adjusted for age and gender, Hispanics were most likely to have esophagitis (OR=1.28, P-value<0.0001) compared to Caucasians. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate an association of suspected Barrett's esophagus and stricture with white patients and esophagitis with Hispanic patients. These findings need to be followed-up with further study.
