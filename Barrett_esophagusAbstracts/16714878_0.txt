 BACKGROUND/AIMS: The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in Korea was believed to be low until now. Korea is now believed to be on the evolving stage of GERD in its' prevalence. The aims of this study were to evaluate the epidemiologic and clinicopathologic characteristics among the subgroups of GERD i.e. non-erosive GERD (NERD), erosive GERD (ERD) and Barrett's esophagus (BE), and the role of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in the pathogenesis of GERD. METHODS: A total of 253 patients with typical symptoms of GERD who underwent EGD were enrolled from October 2002 to January 2004. Patients were grouped as NERD, ERD or BE based on the symptoms and endoscopic findings. BE was histologically confirmed if necessary. Various clinical parameters including the status of H. pylori infection were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 253 patients, 106 patients were classified as NERD while 116 and 31 patients were classified as ERD and BE group respectively. BE and ERD group showed no gender predilection while NERD showed female preponderance (2.31:1, p < 0.05). NERD group were younger (49.57 y.o.) than BE (57.87 y.o.) and ERD (52.30 y.o.) group. About three quarters of the patients of erosive esophagitis were LA-A (74.2%) grade. This suggests the mild nature of erosive esophagitis in Korea. ERD showed significantly higher BMI (kg/m2) compared to NERD (p < 0.05). Hiatal hernia was frequently associated with BE and ERD (p < 0.05), but less frequently in NERD. Overall H. pylori positivity among GERD was significantly lower than the age and gender matched control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of GERD in Korea showed different epidemiologic and clinical characteristics. Lower rate of H. pylori infection among GERD group may reflect the protective role of H. pylori infection regarding GERD prevalence in Korea.
