Barrett's oesophagus has a well-recognized association with oesophageal adenocarcinoma, with phenotypic progression through dysplasia to malignancy. The nuclear phosphoprotein p53 is a putative tumour suppressor with mutations resulting in both loss of negative growth regulatory function and possible gain of oncogene function. Many mutant forms have a prolonged half-life and are demonstrable with immunohistochemical techniques. We examined 62 endoscopic oesophageal biopsies and 36 oesophageal resections for p53 overexpression using the monoclonal antibody DO-7 on paraffin-embedded tissue. The series included 40 cases of Barrett's metaplasia, 13 cases of dysplasia, and 81 cases of adenocarcinoma. None of the cases of metaplasia was p53-positive, compared with 4/13 cases of dysplasia and 52/81 cases of adenocarcinoma. There was no association between the degree of dysplasia and p53 expression, although a trend emerged of increasing p53 expression with higher tumour grade. We conclude that p53 overexpression is frequent in oesophageal adenocarcinoma and may be related to tumour grade. p53 overexpression is not restricted to neoplastic lesions and mutation of this tumour suppressor may occur early in the malignant progression of Barrett's oesophagus.
