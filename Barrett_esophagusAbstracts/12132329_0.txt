 INTRODUCTION: According to the case-control studies, colon adenomas are not more frequent as usual in patients with Barrett's oesophagus. AIM: Analysis of the relationship of Barrett's oesophagus with colon adenomas through a case presentation. METHOD: The 62-years old male patient has been treated with pantoprazole for reflux oesophagitis and histologically proven short-segment Barrett's oesophagus. Pantoprazole treatment was started and the patient became symptom-free. In 1997 colonoscopy was performed for rectal bleeding and 4 recto-sigmoideal polyps were removed (tubular adenomas). After 4 years of PPI treatment, laparoscopic fundoplication was performed but after one year of symptom-free period, PPI was started again because of relapse. The patient was followed-up for 5 years. The histological examinations included also Ki67 and p53 antibody staining. RESULTS: On control colonoscopies, small rectal and sigmoid polyps were found. The retrospective histologic examination of the polyps revealed the increase of Ki-67-positive cells from 2-5% to 45-55% during the 5 years of follow-up, which is higher than the values found in controls and may express the increasing proliferative activity of the epithelium. CONCLUSION: Although according to the literature, Barrett's oesophagus does not increase the risk of colon adenomas, this may occur in individual cases, warranting close follow-up.
