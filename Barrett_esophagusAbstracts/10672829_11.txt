BACKGROUND: Intestinal metaplasia at the gastroesophageal junction is associated with Barrett esophagus, gastric cardiac cancer, and gastritis. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal metaplasia among patients with symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to study clinical, endoscopic, and histologic associations with intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-six patients with symptoms indicating gastroesophageal reflux were included in the study. A new classification of the Z-line appearance was used. RESULTS: The Z-line appearance was found to correlate with the prevalence of intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction (P = 0.0001). Intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction was found in 15.0% of the patients. There was a statistically significant association between intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction and tongues of columnar epithelium at the Z-line (P = 0.020), intestinal metaplasia in the cardia (P = 0.020), positive CLO test (P = 0.026), smoking (P = 0.041), and age (P = 0.050). There was no association with endoscopic or histologic signs of esophagitis or with the severity or duration of GERD symptoms. CONCLUSION: Intestinal metaplasia at the squamocolumnar junction correlates with the Z-line appearance, which would justify a new classification.
