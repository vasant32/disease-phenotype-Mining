In oncology, follow-up refers to the medical procedures aimed to control, over time, both patients at risk of developing cancer, or those already submitted to surgical treatments for neoplastic lesions. The usefulness of an endoscopic follow-up in oncological diseases of the gastrointestinal tract is still being debated and, in some cases, a variety of different protocols are often employed for the same disease. At Regina Elena Cancer Institute, after a critical review of our data and literature, we established and followed guidelines of endoscopic follow-up for patients both at risk and submitted to curative surgery for cancer.
