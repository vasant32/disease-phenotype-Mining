 BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an endoscopic technique used to eradicate Barrett's esophagus (BE). However, such ablation can commonly lead to neosquamous epithelium overlying residual BE glands not visible by conventional endoscopy and may evade detection on random biopsy samples. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the capability of endoscopic 3-dimensional optical coherence tomography (3D-OCT) for the identification and characterization of buried glands before and after RFA therapy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Single teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-six male and 1 female white patients with BE undergoing RFA treatment. INTERVENTIONS: 3D-OCT was performed at the gastroesophageal junction in 18 patients before attaining complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (pre-CE-IM group) and in 16 patients after CE-IM (post-CE-IM group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence, size, and location of buried glands relative to the squamocolumnar junction. RESULTS: 3D-OCT provided an approximately 30 to 60 times larger field of view compared with jumbo and standard biopsy and sufficient imaging depth for detecting buried glands. Based on 3D-OCT results, buried glands were found in 72% of patients (13/18) in the pre-CE-IM group and 63% of patients (10/16) in the post-CE-IM group. The number (mean [standard deviation]) of buried glands per patient in the post-CE-IM group (7.1 [9.3]) was significantly lower compared with the pre-CE-IM group (34.4 [44.6]; P = .02). The buried gland size (P = .69) and distribution (P = .54) were not significantly different before and after CE-IM. LIMITATIONS: A single-center, cross-sectional study comparing patients at different time points in treatment. Lack of 1-to-1 coregistered histology for all OCT data sets obtained in vivo. CONCLUSION: Buried glands were frequently detected with 3D-OCT near the gastroesophageal junction before and after radiofrequency ablation.
