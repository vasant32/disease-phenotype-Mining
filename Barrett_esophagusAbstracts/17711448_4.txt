AIMS: To clarify the distribution and significance of the oesophageal and gastric cardiac mucosae at the oesophago-gastric junction (EGJ). METHODS AND RESULTS: Oesophagectomy specimens from 131 consecutive patients with middle and upper thoracic oesophageal cancer were examined. The surgically resected specimens including the EGJ were cut into 5 mm thick serial sections and examined histopathologically for the length of the oesophageal and gastric cardiac mucosae and the incidence of columnar epithelial islands (CEIs). We also determined the presence of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus (SSBE) and goblet cell metaplasia in SSBE. Oesophageal cardiac mucosa was found in 125 cases (95%) and gastric cardiac mucosa was found in all cases. The mean length of the oesophageal and gastric cardiac mucosa was 4 mm (range 1-26 mm) and 13 mm (range 2-64 mm), respectively. CEIs were found in 75 cases (57%). SSBE was found in 70 cases (53%), among which goblet cell metaplasia was found in 28 cases (21%). No long-segment Barrett's oesophagus was found. The mean length of oesophageal cardiac mucosa (6 mm) and gastric cardiac mucosa (17 mm) in SSBE was significantly greater than that (3 mm and 8 mm, respectively) in non-SSBE cases (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001). The incidence (69%) of CEIs in SSBE was significantly higher than that (44%) in non-SSBE cases (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Oesophageal and gastric cardiac mucosae were found frequently. Oesophageal cardiac glands and CEIs might play an important role in the development of SSBE.
