Conventionally, long-segment Barrett's esophagus (LSBE) has been considered a high-risk background for the occurrence of Barrett's adenocarcinoma in Western countries, and random biopsy has been proposed for surveillance, aiming to detect early cancer. However, accurate detection of a lesion and diagnosis of the expansion are difficult by this blind method. Herein, we report a case of early Barrett's adenocarcinoma derived from LSBE that was successfully detected by narrow-band imaging with magnifying endoscopy.
