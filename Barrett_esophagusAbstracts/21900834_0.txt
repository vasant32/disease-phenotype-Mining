We report on 2 cases of long-term survivors of childhood solid tumors, who developed Barrett esophagus (BE) after treatment for neuroblastoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively. Case 1: A stage 3 neuroblastoma was treated with surgery, carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy, and supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy (30 Gy). Twelve years later, based on endoscopic and histologic findings, BE was diagnosed on the middle segment. Case 2: A stage IIIB Hodgkin lymphoma received mechloretamine, oncovin, procarbazine, prednisone/adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine chemotherapy and supra/subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy (25 Gy). Nineteen years later, BE was diagnosed associated with an esophageal stricture. In long-term survivors of childhood tumors who had received chest/neck radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the risk of BE may be increased, therefore the diagnosis should be considered in the presence of gastroesophageal symptoms.
