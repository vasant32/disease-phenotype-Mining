 BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess differences in health care resource utilization and costs associated with once-daily and twice-daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) achieve symptom control on once-daily PPI therapy, but approximately 20%-30% require twice-daily dosing. METHODS: Patients were ≥18 years of age with at least one medical claim for GERD and at least two PPI claims from HealthCore's Integrated Research Database (HIRD(SM)) during 2004-2009. Patients were continuously eligible for 12 months before and after the index date (date of first PPI claim). Based on PPI dosing throughout the post-index period (quantity of medication dispensed/number of days supply), patients were classified as once-daily (dose ≤ 1.5 pills per day) or twice-daily (≥1.5) PPI users. RESULTS: The study cohort included 248,386 patients with GERD (mean age 52.8 ± 13.93 years, 56% females) of whom 90% were once-daily and 10% were twice-daily PPI users. The Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index for once-daily and twice-daily PPI users was 0.70 ± 1.37 and 0.89 ± 1.54, respectively (P < 0.05). More once-daily patients had claims for Barrett's esophagus (5% versus 2%, P < 0.0001) than twice-daily patients. Post-index, higher proportions of twice-daily patients had at least one GERD-related inpatient visit (7% versus 5%), outpatient visit (60% versus 49%), and office visit (48% versus 38%) versus once-daily patients (P < 0.0001). Mean total GERD-related health care costs were $2065 ± $6636 versus $3749 ± $11,081 for once-daily and twice-daily PPI users, respectively (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Patients receiving twice-daily PPI therapy were likely to have more comorbid conditions and greater health care utilization and overall costs compared with patients using once-daily PPI therapy.
