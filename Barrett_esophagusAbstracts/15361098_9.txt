The aim of the prospective clinical study presented here is to test the effectiveness of a multimode approach consisting of argon plasma coagulation combined with laparoscopic fundoplication in the management of Barrett's esophagus. Argon plasma coagulation was performed in 19 patients with Barrett's esophagus who had previously undergone surgical antireflux treatment. The mean follow-up time was 17 months, ranging between 6 and 27 months. Squamous epithelium was completely restored in all patients. In 68.4% of cases two sessions were required. The most frequent complications were chest discomfort and retrosternal pain. In 11 patients the symptoms lasted 3 days and in six cases persisted for a longer period, requiring analgesic medication. Short-term dysphagia and odynophagia were observed in four patients.
