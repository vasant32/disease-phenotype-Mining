We report about a patient with esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis (EIP) who was referred to our department for further investigation of dysphagia. EIP is a rare, pathologically well defined disease, most frequently characterized by stricture-associated symptoms. The diagnosis of EIP is made by barium swallow and can be confirmed by endoscopy which shows typical diverticula-like changes of the esophageal wall.
