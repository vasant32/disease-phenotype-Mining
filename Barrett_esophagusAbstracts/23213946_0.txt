This paper aims at evaluating the impact of vitamins intake in the prevention of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's oesophagus (BE), and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC). It concentrates primarily on the antioxidant vitamins A, C and E. There were 180 subjects included in the trial, 109 males and 71 females, which were divided in the four groups (70 patients with GERD, 20 patients with BE, 20 patients with EADC, and 70 healthy examinees composing a control group). Their antioxidant vitamins intake was investigated through the usage of the dietary questionnaires. Concentration of the mentioned antioxidant vitamin in serum was detected by HPLC method, and although there were no major statistical differences in their levels between four groups, there existed a correlation between the vitamin serum concentration and the rephlux disease degree. The results showed that the healthy examinees had consumed the greater quantities of the vitamins A, C and E, through both the natural (fruits and vegetables) and the supplementary (industrial vitamin additives) way, than the patients with GERD, BE and EADC. This was reflected in the higher serum levels of the mentioned vitamins in the first group in the comparison with the second group. Based on this, the intake of the vitamins A, C and E through both the natural and the supplementary ways is suggested in order to prevent the development of the GERD, BE and EADC.
