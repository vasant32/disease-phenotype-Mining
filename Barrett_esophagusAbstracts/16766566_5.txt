 BACKGROUND: There had never been a clear definition of the cancer of cardia before Siewert's classification, which was proposed in 1996 and approved in 1997 at the second International Gastric Cancer Congress in Munich. On the basis of the classification, this study aims to research into the clinicopathological characteristics and surgical modes of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction in China. METHODS: The study reviewed the data of the distal esophageal cancer, the cancer of cardia and the proximal gastric cancer at the First Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 1995 to December 1999. Surgical patients were defined and classified according to Siewert's classification, and 203 patients were up to the classification. Then the study compared and analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics and the survival rates of the three types of the tumor. RESULTS: Among the 203 patients, there were 29 patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus (Type I); 80 patients with true carcinoma of cardia (Type II); and 94 patients with subcardial carcinoma (Type III). Obvious differences were found in the clinicopathological characteristics of the three types, but no significant difference of the 5-year survival rates was found among the three types of patients with curative resection. CONCLUSION: On the data, the distribution of the three types of tumor was found to be different from that reported in Western countries and in Japan; and the three types of patients who had undergone curative resection were found to have similar 5-year survival rates.
