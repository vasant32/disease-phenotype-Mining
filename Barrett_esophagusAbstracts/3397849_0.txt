Data on the frequency of regression of Barrett's esophagus after medical therapy or antireflux surgery in adult patients are conflicting; these data, with regard to pediatric age, where Barrett's esophagus is considered rare, are scarce and disappointing after antireflux surgery. We report a 4-month-old infant affected by severe reflux esophagitis who developed a junctional-type Barrett's epithelium. Histochemical procedures to detect mucin pattern were also carried out. The regression of Barrett's esophagus was observed 4 months after antireflux surgery whereas medical therapy had been unsuccessful. We suggest that esophageal biopsy should also be performed in the presence of severe esophagitis. Longer follow-up observations of other patients may clarify the role of antireflux surgery when Barrett's esophagus complicates gastroesophageal reflux (GER).
