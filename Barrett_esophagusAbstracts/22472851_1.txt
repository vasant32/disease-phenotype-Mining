 BACKGROUND/AIMS: The relationship between gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GEJA) and Helicobacter pylori infection is not well defined; thus, we retrospectively investigated this relationship. METHODS: We examined 852 cases (646 men) of gastric cancer. GEJA was defined as type II according to the classification system of Siewert and Stein. We compared the prevalence of H. pylori infection and corporal gastritis in GEJA patients with distal gastric cancer. RESULTS: GEJA was observed in 80 (including 6 cases of Barrett's esophageal cancer) of the 852 cases of gastric cancer examined (9.4%). The rate of H. pylori infection was significantly lower in patients with GEJA than in patients with distal gastric cancer (73.8 vs. 94.1%, p < 0.05). The prevalence of corporal gastritis was also significantly lower in patients with GEJA than in patients with distal gastric cancer (80.7 vs. 94.6%, p < 0.05). Concurrent H. pylori infection and corporal gastritis were not observed in patients with Barrett's esophageal cancer. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that GEJA has 2 etiologic types; one of these types is associated with H. pylori infection and resembles distal gastric cancer, and the other one is not associated with H. pylori infection or Barrett's esophageal cancer.
