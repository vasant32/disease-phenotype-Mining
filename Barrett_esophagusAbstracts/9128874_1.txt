OBJECTIVE: Duodenal contents refluxing into the esophagus may be involved in the pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This study was performed to investigate whether medical treatment of GERD aimed at suppression of gastric acid production can prevent the development of complications, such as Barrett's metaplasia or poor esophageal body motility. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: 138 GERD patients were analyzed regarding the development of Barrett's metaplasia or poor esophageal body motility, despite intermittent or continuous treatment with H2 blockers or omeprazole. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The rate of patients with Barrett's metaplasia or poor esophageal body motility with or without effective medical treatment. RESULTS: Barrett's metaplasia was found in 33.8% of patients receiving medical treatment, although it was not present when treatment was induced. This rate was 21.9% among patients who were not receiving therapy (not significant). In all, 41.9% of patients with medication had impaired esophageal body motility compared with 59.3% of patients not receiving treatment (P < 0.05), but these patients had a significantly shorter history of GERD. CONCLUSIONS: Medical treatment with H2 blockers or omeprazole does not prevent the development of Barrett's metaplasia or poor esophageal body motility.
