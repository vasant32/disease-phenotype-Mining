We report an unusual case of an esophageal-atrial fistula in a patient with CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophagitis, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia) variant of scleroderma. An ulcer in Barrett's esophagus perforated into the left atrium and led to systemic embolization and cerebral abscess. A review of similar reports of esophageal-atrial fistula reveals a symptom complex that includes chronic esophageal pathology, gastrointestinal bleeding, and neurological signs. An antemortem diagnosis has never been made.
