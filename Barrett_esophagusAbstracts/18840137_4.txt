 SUMMARY: Barrett's esophagus (BE) may be an adaptive cellular response to repeated acid exposure. The aims of this study were to compare intracellular acid loading in BE cells with normal squamous esophageal cells. Primary squamous and BE cells were obtained endoscopically and cultured for up to 24 h. Barrett's adenocarcinoma cell lines TE7 and OE-33 were compared with a normal esophageal (NE) cell line OE-21. Extracellular pH was lowered to 6.0 using HCl; specific ion exchangers were blocked pharmacologically and pH microfluorimetry was performed using 2'7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. The effect of prolonged acid preincubations and repeated acid exposure on acid loading and recovery were examined. Acid loading was greater in primary BE than NE cells (DeltapHi -0.22 +/- 0.08 vs.-0.13 +/- 0.01) and maximal in the BE carcinoma cell line TE7 (DeltapHi -0.30 +/- 0.01). Whereas TE7 cells were able to recover fully from repeated acid exposure, OE-21 cells remained profoundly acidic. BE primary and transformed cells utilize DIDS inhibitable sodium-independent chloride/bicarbonate exchange as well as sodium/hydrogen ion exchange for acid loading. In contrast, SE only requires sodium-independent chloride/bicarbonate exchange for acidification. The degree of acid loading is greater in BE than NE cells and it occurs via dual ion exchangers similar to gastric mucosa. Only Barrett's epithelial cells can maintain a physiological pHi following prolonged and repeated reflux exposure, which may confer a teleological advantage.
