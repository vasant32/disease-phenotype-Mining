Pathologic gastroesophageal acid reflux appears to be involved in the pathogenicity of Barrett's esophagus. The possible pathogenic role of duodenogastric reflux, however, has been suggested by several studies. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the prevalence of acid or duodenogastric reflux in patients with Barrett's esophagus. Nine patients with histologically proven Barrett's esophagus (mean length: 7.7cm; range: 2-13 cm) were studied by esophageal manometry and 24 hour pHmetry. Duodenogastric reflux was measured in the interdigestive period by aspiration and during the postprandial period using an isotopic method. The results of these different investigations were compared with healthy volunteers (n = 20 to 27). Three patients had complicated Barrett's esophagus (Barrett's ulcer: n = 2, high-grade dysplasia: n = 1). The results of the different investigations showed that a) all patients had abnormal acid exposure and an esophageal motor dysfunction (decrease in lower esophageal sphincter pressure, amplitude and duration of contractions and increase in percentage of peristaltic dysfunction); b) none of the patients had any pathologic duodenogastric reflux neither in the interdigestive nor in the postprandial period. These results a) confirm the high prevalence of acid reflux in patients with Barrett's esophagus, b) show that bile or pancreatic secretions are not involved in the pathogenicity of Barrett's esophagus.
