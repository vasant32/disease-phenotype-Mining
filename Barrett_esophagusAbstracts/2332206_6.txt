Superficial adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus is defined as carcinoma limited to the mucosa or submucosa regardless of lymph node status. Columnar epithelium lined lower oesophagus, now generally referred to as Barrett's oesophagus, is probably the main cause of adenocarcinoma in the lower oesophagus. Twelve cases of superficial adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's oesophagus are presented. They were observed over a 6 year period and taken from a series of 50 cases of patients with Barrett's oesophagus and adenocarcinoma, a prevalence of 24%. Endoscopic diagnosis of malignancy was made in six patients. The initial biopsies showed an adenocarcinoma in six patients and some degrees of dysplasia in the other six patients. Prior to surgery, a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was made in all twelve patients. In four patients the adenocarcinoma was confined to the mucosa, and in eight it extended to the submucosa. One patient had a metastatic lymph node. Ten patients are alive without evidence of tumour spread after a mean follow-up of 30 months.
