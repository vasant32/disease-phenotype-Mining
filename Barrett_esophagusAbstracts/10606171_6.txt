Since adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and cardia is increasing at an alarming rate, major efforts are currently oriented to identify patients who may benefit from extensive resection. Between November 1992 and May 1998, 218 patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus or cardia were referred to our Department. In six patients (10.2%) with Barrett's adenocarcinoma, cancer was discovered during endoscopic surveillance program for Barrett's metaplasia. Overall, one hundred-forty-seven patients (67%) underwent resection. Fifty-one underwent an extended mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Median cumulative survival was 25.9+/-3.1 months in patients undergoing resection, and 7+/-1.3 months in patients having palliation (p<0.01). Survival was significantly longer in patients with negative nodes than in those with lymph node metastases (54+/-12.9 versus 17+/-2.8 months, p<0.01). Six of the 51 patients (11.8%) undergoing extended lymphadenectomy had metastatic upper mediastinal nodes. Additional serial sections and immunohistochemistry were performed in 46 patients. In 6 of 18 patients (33.3%) with negative nodes at conventional hematoxylin-eosin examination, immunohistochemistry demonstrated micrometastases in the lesser curve, paracardial, peripancreatic, or lower mediastinal nodes. Early diagnosis remains the prerequisite for curative treatment of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and cardia. When a curative resection is attempted, extended lymphadenectomy improves tumor staging and may prevent local recurrences. Serial sections and immunohistochemistry provide additional accuracy in the staging of the disease and may prove useful to select patients for adjuvant therapy.
