 OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiological data on Barrett's esophagus are scant in Asia, so the purpose of this study was to compare and analyze the pathophysiological characteristics of Barrett's esophagus and reflux esophagitis among Chinese in Taiwan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From November 2001 to January 2003, fifteen patients with Barrett's esophagus were consecutively enrolled as the Barrett's esophagus group. Fourteen patients with Los Angeles grade A/B esophagitis (mild esophagitis group) and fourteen patients with LA grade C/D esophagitis (severe esophagitis group) who were matched in age and gender with the Barrett's esophagus group were enrolled. The data of esophageal manometry and ambulatory 24-hour pH monitoring were collected. RESULTS: We found that the Barrett's esophagus group had significantly weaker lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and distal esophageal body contractions (p<0.05) than the mild esophagitis group. Both the Barrett's esophagus group and severe esophagitis group had significantly higher esophageal acid reflux scores and frequency (p<0.05-0.01) compared to the mild esophagitis group. However, data on esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring in the Barrett's esophagus and severe esophagitis groups did not significantly differ. CONCLUSION: We concluded that Barrett's esophagus had significantly stronger acid reflux, lower LES pressure, and weaker distal esophageal peristalsis compared to mild esophagitis. Barrett's esophagus and severe reflux esophagitis share common pathophysiological characteristics among Chinese in Taiwan.
