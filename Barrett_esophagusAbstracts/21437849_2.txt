 BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Endoscopic spray cryoablation is a novel approach for the treatment of Barrett's esophagus. However, few studies have reported its efficacy, especially with the use of carbon dioxide (CO (2)). The aim of the current study was to evaluate the short term efficacy and complications using CO (2) in endoscopic cryoablation of Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus underwent monthly stepwise cryoablation with pressurized CO (2) gas, with follow-up esophageal biopsies until complete histological reversal was achieved. Responses were analyzed with an intention-to-treat analysis according to complete response for intestinal metaplasia (CR-IM), which was defined as the elimination of all intestinal metaplasia including specialized intestinal metaplasia (SIM), subsquamous SIM, and dysplasia with intestinal metaplasia in the biopsies under narrow-band imaging (NBI). RESULTS: In total, 22 patients were enrolled, 20 of whom completed the treatment. Two patients declined further ablation after the first cryotherapy session. A total of 44 sessions were performed; a median of 2 sessions per patient (range 1 - 3 sessions) were needed to complete the ablation of Barrett's esophagus. No severe complications occurred. Follow-up endoscopies were performed in 20 patients (90.9 %). Two patients (9.1 %) were lost to follow-up. Median follow-up was 10 months (range 6 - 18 months). After cryotherapy, 20 patients (90.9 %) reached CR-IM of Barrett's esophagus. Patients underwent a median number of 3 follow-up endoscopies (range 2 - 4) with biopsies. At 6 months, recurrence was evident in three patients (13.6 % of the overall population, 15.0 % of the CR-IM population). One of the three patients developed intestinal metaplasia but no dysplastic change and the other two developed subsquamous SIM. CONCLUSIONS: The pressurized CO (2) spray cryotherapy is a relatively effective and safe endoscopic treatment for Barrett's esophagus.
