Barrett esophagus continues to intrigue investigators and clinicians alike as the new millennium begins. A large number of publications in the past year have discussed issues of epidemiology, prevalence, detection, and treatment of Barrett esophagus. Chronic symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux were identified as a strong risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma. The relative frequency of short and long Barrett and cardia intestinal metaplasia in patients who undergo upper endoscopy have been better defined. Biomarkers in patients with Barrett may eventually be helpful in identifying those at high risk for the development of neoplasia. High-dose proton pump inhibition to the point of near elimination of esophageal acid exposure remains disappointing in its impact on the surface area of Barrett. Finally, the developments in endoscopic therapy for patients with Barrett esophagus continue to be promising.
