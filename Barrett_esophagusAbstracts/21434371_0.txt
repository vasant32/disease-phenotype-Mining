 UNLABELLED: Barrett esophagus is the most serious sequela of the gastroesophageal reflux disease being an obligate precancer with a high index of the neoplastic transformation as to an adenocarcinoma esophagus. THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER: To reveal the extent of the susceptibility to oncogenesis of the Barrett esophagus-patients and to determine high-risk groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our paper has shown the examination results of the 55 Barrett esophagus-patients (29 women and 26 men at the age of 39 to 62 years old), including 40 intestinal metaplasia-patients and 15 patients of the intestinal metaplasia + dysplasia of long clinical course given corresponding correcting cure. In our investigation a DNA-flow cytometry was a method of determining the adenocarcinoma esophagus risk secondary to the Barrett esophagus as well as an index of the proliferation and an index of the aneuploidy were the factors analyzed. THE RESULTS: 1) As the pathosis histology-progresses from metaplasia to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma esophagus the increase in the aneuploidy rate, the proliferation index, and S-cycling state cells portion is observed; 2) the proliferation index is a rather stable factor of the human body susceptibility to oncogenesis and varies only slightly in the course of the cure. The index of the aneuploidy is a labile factor that can be subject to decrease down to normal figures given corresponding cure (p > 0.05); 3) the increased aneuploidy index in the presence of the intestinal metaplasia free of esophagus dysplasia can serve as an objective factor for neoplastic progression.
