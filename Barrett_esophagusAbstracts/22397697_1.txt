We report analysis of N-glycans derived from disease-free individuals and patients with Barrett's esophagus, high-grade dysplasia, and esophageal adenocarcinoma by microchip electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection. Serum samples in 10 Î¼L aliquots are enzymatically treated to cleave the N-glycans that are subsequently reacted with 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid to add charge and a fluorescent label. Separations at 1250 V/cm and over 22 cm yielded efficiencies up to 700,000 plates for the N-glycans and analysis times under 100 s. Principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of the peak areas and migration times are used to evaluate N-glycan profiles from native and desialylated samples and determine differences among the four sample groups. With microchip electrophoresis, we are able to distinguish the three patient groups from each other and from disease-free individuals.
