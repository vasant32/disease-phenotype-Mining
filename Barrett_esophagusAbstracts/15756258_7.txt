As emerging in the recent literature, CD1a has been regarded as a molecule whose expression may reflect tumour evolution. The aim of the present work was to investigate the expression of CD1a in a series of Barrett's metaplasia (BM), gastric type (GTBM), with and without follow-up, in order to analyse whether its expression may help to diagnose this disease and to address the outcome. Indeed, GTBM may be confused sometimes with islets of ectopic gastric mucosa and its evolution towards dysplasia (Dy) or carcinoma (Ca) could not be foreseen. We showed a significant higher expression of CD1a in GTBM than in both Dy and Ca; nevertheless, the number of positive GTBM was significantly lower in the group of cases that at follow-up underwent Dy or Ca. Our data address that CD1a may be a novel biomarker for BM and that its expression may help to predict the prognosis of this pathology.
