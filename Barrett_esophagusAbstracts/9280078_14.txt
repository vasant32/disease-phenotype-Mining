The study compares, in true adenocarcinoma of the cardia and in adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus, the prevalence of early cancers and their outcome in those patients suitable for resection surgery. From 1980 to 1993, 26 of 350 (7.4%) resected adenocarcinomas of the esophago-gastric junction were pathologically staged as early cancer or pT1. The prevalence of early cancer was 3.7% (11/294) for true cancer of the cardia and 27% (15/56) for cancer in Barrett's esophagus (P < 0.001). Ten of the 15 latter cancers were diagnosed during endoscopic surveillance for benign Barrett's esophagus. Among early cancers, there were four mucosal and 22 submucosal tumours; of the latter, eight had lymph node metastasis and seven neoplastic permeation of lympho-hematic vessels. The most frequently used surgical procedure was esophago-gastric resection and gastric pull-up. Postoperative morbidity was 15.4%, and hospital mortality 3.8%. Excluding postoperative deaths, the overall 5-year survival rate was 79% for early cancer of the cardia and 83% for early cancer in Barrett's esophagus (log rank test = 0.0214, P = 0.88). Overall, the survival rate was 100% in the absence of lymph node metastasis and 43% in the presence of node metastasis (log rank test = 15.811, P = 0.0001). Only one of five patients with both node metastasis and vessel infiltration survived longer than 5 years. In conclusion, the prevalence of early cancer was significantly greater for cancer in Barrett's esophagus than for true cancer of the cardia. Prognosis of the two types of tumour after resection surgery was the same and depended on lymph node status and neoplastic permeation of lympho-hematic vessels.
