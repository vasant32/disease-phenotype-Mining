 OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether Barrett's metaplasia may develop despite effective medical therapy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Gastroesophageal reflux disease has a multifactorial etiology. Therefore, medical treatment may not prevent complications of reflux disease. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with reflux disease and mild esophagitis were prospectively studied for the development of Barrett's metaplasia while receiving long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors and cisapride. Only patients who had effective control of reflux symptoms and esophagitis were included. The surveillance time was 2 years. The outcome of these 83 patients was compared with that of 42 patients in whom antireflux surgery was performed with a median follow-up of 3.5 years. RESULTS: Twelve (14.5%) patients developed Barrett's while receiving medical therapy; this was not seen after surgery. Patients developing Barrett's had a weaker lower esophageal sphincter and peristalsis before treatment than patients with uncomplicated disease. CONCLUSIONS: Antireflux surgery is superior to medical therapy in the prevention of Barrett's metaplasia. Therefore, patients with reflux disease who have a weak lower esophageal sphincter and poor esophageal peristalsis should undergo antireflux surgery, even if they have only mild esophagitis.
