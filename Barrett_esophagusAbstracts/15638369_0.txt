The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation of c-erb-b2 and Bcl-xl expression in biopsy specimens of Barrett's oesophagus from 44 patients with morphological features. The examined group was subdivided into: negative for dysplasia, indefinite for dysplasia, positive for dysplasia-low grade, and adenocarcinoma with high grade dysplasia. Positive c-erb-B2 staining was found in 34.1% and Bcl-xl protein expression was observed in 96.9% of BE. The results showed increased c-erb-B2 and Bcl-xl protein expressions with progressive grades of dysplasia to adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, an evaluation of c-erb-B2 and Bcl-xl expression can be useful for the histopatologic diagnosis of BE and correct interpretation of dysplasia.
