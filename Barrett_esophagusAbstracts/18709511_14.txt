 INTRODUCTION: The long-term management of gastroesophageal reflux in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) is not well supported by an evidence-based consensus. We compare treatment outcome in patients with and without BE submitted to standardized laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) or esomeprazole treatment. METHODS: In the Long-Term Usage of Acid Suppression Versus Antireflux Surgery trial (a European multicenter randomized study), LARS was compared with dose-adjusted esomeprazole (20-40 mg daily). Operative difficulty, complications, symptom outcomes [Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia (QOLRAD)], and treatment failure at 3 years and pH testing (after 6 months) are reported. RESULTS: Of 554 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, 60 had BE-28 randomized to esomeprazole and 32 to LARS. Very few BE patients on either treatment strategy (four of 60) experienced treatment failure during the 3-year follow-up. Esophageal pH in BE patients was significantly better controlled after surgical treatment than after esomeprazole (p = 0.002), although mean GSRS and QOLRAD scores were similar for the two therapies at baseline and at 3 years. Although operative difficulty was slightly greater in patients with BE than those without, there was no difference in postoperative complications or level of symptomatic reflux control. CONCLUSION: In a well-controlled surgical environment, the success of LARS is similar in patients with or without BE and matches optimized medical therapy.
