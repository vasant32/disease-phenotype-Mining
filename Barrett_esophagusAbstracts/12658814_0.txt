To determine the relationship between Barrett's esophagus (BE) and features of gastroesophageal acid reflux, 24 h esophageal pH monitoring was performed in 90 patients. The patients were divided into 3 groups: 31 subjects with BE, 21 with mild esophagitis and 38 with severe esophagitis. The following parameters were evaluated: the percentage time of pH < 4; the number of reflux episodes over 5 min; the duration of longest episodes and DeMeester score over total period and the auterior three parameters in erect and supine position. All these parameters in BE were significantly different from those with mild esophagitis (P < 0.01) and not significantly different from those with severe esophagitis (P > 0.05). During supine position all the above parameters in BE were significantly different from those with reflux esophagitis (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the quantity of acid reflux is not an important factor in development of BE in gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and the acid reflux in supine position might be important in development of BE in GER.
