BACKGROUND/AIM: Acid output is related to the gastritis pattern in Helicobacter pylori infection. The hypothesis to be tested is that gastritis in patients with Barrett's esophagus, defined as columnar epithelia lined lower esophagus (CELLO) with intestinal metaplasia (IM), is antrum predominant. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy were investigated for CELLO. The gastritis parameters H. pylori density, activity, and chronicity were graded in biopsy specimens of antrum and corpus. IM was assessed in biopsies from CELLO patients. In a prospective part, 19 patients with CELLO with IM were compared with 38 age-matched control patient with dyspepsia. RESULTS: Of 200 patients with CELLO, 85% had a short segment (<3 cm), 15% a segment of > or =3 cm. IM was present in 36% of cases with a short CELLO and in 84% of patients with a long segment. The H. pylori prevalence was 50%, independent of the length of CELLO or the presence of IM. The gastritis phenotype was minimally antrum predominant. The antrum/corpus distribution was not related to the length of CELLO or the presence of IM and not different from controls. The activity in corpus and antrum was lower in patients with CELLO with IM as compared with patients with CELLO without IM or controls. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of patients with CELLO are H. pylori infected. The pattern of H. pylori gastritis is characterized by a pangastritis with low activity which is not likely to predispose to an increase in acid output after eradication.
