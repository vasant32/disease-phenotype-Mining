Dysplasia is the most important marker of progression to invasive cancer in Barrett's esophagus. Intensive endoscopic surveillance with biopsy may identify invasive cancer in a patient with high-grade dysplasia (HGD). Close relationship with an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist and thoracic surgeon will improve treatment decisions and patient outcomes. No intervention is required in patients with low-grade dysplasia (LGD); continued surveillance is recommended. Surgical resection is the currently accepted therapy for high-grade dysplasia. Endoscopic ablative therapy remains experimental.
