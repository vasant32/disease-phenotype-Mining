 BACKGROUND: EMR is an accepted treatment for early esophageal cancer and high-grade dysplasia. One of the limitations of this technique is that extensive mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection may be required to obtain complete removal of the neoplasm, which may result in significant stricture formation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of an endoscopically deployed extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold material for prevention of esophageal stenosis after circumferential EMR. DESIGN: Ten mongrel dogs were subjected to surgical plane anesthesia and circumferential esophageal EMR by the cap technique. In 5 animals, an ECM scaffold material was endoscopically placed at the resection site; the remaining 5 animals were subjected to circumferential esophageal EMR without ECM placement. Follow-up endoscopy was performed at 4 and 8 weeks; necropsy with histologic assessment was performed at 8 weeks. SETTING: Animal laboratory. INTERVENTIONS: Circumferential esophageal EMR by the cap technique, followed by endoscopic placement of an ECM scaffold material. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Degree of esophageal stricture and histologic assessment of remodeled esophageal tissue. RESULTS: All 5 control dogs had endoscopic evidence of esophageal stenosis. Three required early euthanasia because of inability to tolerate oral intake. Incomplete epithelialization and inflammation persisted at the EMR site in control animals. Endoscopic placement of an ECM scaffold material prevented clinically significant esophageal stenosis in all animals. Histologic assessment showed near-normal esophageal tissue with a lack of inflammation or scar tissue at 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic placement of an ECM scaffold material prevented esophageal stricture formation after circumferential EMR in this canine model during short-term observation.
