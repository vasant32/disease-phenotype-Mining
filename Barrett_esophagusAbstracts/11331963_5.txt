Barrett esophagus, especially dysplastic Barrett mucosa, has been regarded as a preneoplastic lesion for esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of dysplasia and early adenocarcinoma in short- (SSBE) and long- (LSBE) segment Barrett esophagus have not been studied in detail. The aims of this study were to clarify clinicopathologic and genetic differences between high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early adenocarcinoma in SSBE versus LSBE. We analyzed the clinicopathologic features from 47 patients (19 SSBE [<3 cm] and 28 LSBE [> or =3 cm]) with esophagectomy for HGD/T1 adenocarcinoma. Allelic losses on chromosomes 3p (FIHT), 5q (APC), 9p (p16), and 17p (p53) were compared in 12 HGD and 9 T1 tumors from 19 cases of SSBE and in 23 HGD and 15 T1 tumors from 28 cases of LSBE. Patients with SSBE were more likely to be smokers than were patients with LSBE (94.7% v 57.1%; P =.004). HGD or T1 tumors arising from SSBE were less likely to show adjoining nondysplastic Barrett mucosa than those from LSBE (73.6% v 100%; P =.02). LSBE more frequently showed a circumferential pattern of Barrett mucosa than did SSBE (96.4% v 47.3%; P =.0002). Chromosomal allelic losses on 3p, 5q, 9p, and 17p were detected in 19% (4 of 21), 43% (15 of 35), 40% (14 of 35), and 48% (16 of 33) of HGD, respectively, and 26% (5 of 19), 35% (8 of 23), 35% (8 of 23), and 57% (13 of 23) of T1 tumor, respectively. There were no significant differences in allelic loss of 3p, 5q, 9p, or 17p in HGD or T1 tumors from SSBE versus LSBE. These results suggest that both HGD and early adenocarcinoma in SSBE and LSBE may occur through similar genetic alterations, whereas there are some clinicopathologic differences between SSBE and LSBE.
