BACKGROUND: Barrett's oesophagus is thought to be a complication of severe gastro-oesophageal reflux. AIM: To determine whether the proton pump inhibitor, lansoprazole, is effective in healing erosive reflux oesophagitis in patients with Barrett's oesophagus. METHODS: An 8-week, randomized, double-blind study was conducted using patients with both erosive reflux oesophagitis and Barrett's oesophagus. Erosive reflux oesophagitis was defined as grades 2-4 oesophagitis; Barrett's oesophagus, as specialized columnar epithelium obtained by biopsy from the tubular oesophagus; and healing, as a return to grade 0 or 1 oesophageal mucosa (complete re-epithelialization). One-hundred and five (105) patients from one centre were randomized to receive either lansoprazole 30 mg daily or ranitidine 150 mg twice daily. Unhealed or symptomatic lansoprazole patients at week 4 were randomized to receive the same 30 mg dose daily or an increased dose of 60 mg daily. Endoscopy was performed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. RESULTS: The treatment groups were similar in regards to baseline characteristics, erosive reflux oesophagitis grades and length of Barrett's oesophagus. At each 2-week interval, lansoprazole patients had significantly greater healing rates and less day and night heartburn and regurgitation than ranitidine patients. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in antacid use, quality of life parameters, or rate of reported adverse events. Median values for fasting serum gastrin levels remained within the normal range for both groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with both Barrett's oesophagus and erosive reflux oesophagitis, lansoprazole is significantly more effective than ranitidine in relieving reflux symptoms and healing erosive reflux oesophagitis.
