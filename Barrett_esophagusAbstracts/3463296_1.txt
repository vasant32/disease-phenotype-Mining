Since Barrett's original description of the columnar lined lower oesophagus in 1950, this condition has been linked with over 140 cases of adenocarcinoma in the English literature. To date the youngest reported cases are a 23 year old male and a 25 year old male. This report concerns what is believed to be the youngest reported case of adenocarcinoma in a Barrett's oesophagus.
