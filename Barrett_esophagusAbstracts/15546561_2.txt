 BACKGROUND: Peptide YY (PYY) is an endogenous gut hormone that inhibits the growth of certain cancers. Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus usually arises from Barrett's esophagus. We hypothesized that treatment of Barrett's adenocarcinoma with PYY would result in decreased proliferation. METHODS: Barrett's cancer cell lines (BIC and SEG-1) were treated with PYY (3-36) at 500 pmol/mL. Viability was measured by MTT at 24 and 72 hours. Apoptosis and necrosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: PYY reduced proliferation in SEG-1 cells at 24 hours (21.2% +/- 3.4%, P <0.001) and 72 hours (14.2% +/- 6.2%, P <0.001). In the BIC cells, growth was inhibited by 7.9% +/- 7.0%, P = 0.021 after 72 hours. PYY increased late apoptotic activity in SEG-1 cells by 31%, P = 0.014. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of antiproliferative effects of PYY against Barrett's carcinoma in vitro. Reductions in cell growth appear to be mediated by proapoptotic mechanisms. Further investigation of PYY in the treatment of Barrett's adenocarcinoma is warranted.
