Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an established endoscopic technique for ablating Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia or early-stage intraepithelial neoplasia. The most common clinically significant adverse effect of PDT is esophageal stricture formation. The strictures are usually superficial and might be dilated effectively with standard endoscopic accessories, such as endoscope balloon or Savary dilators. However, multiple dilations might be required to achieve stricture resolution in some cases. We report the case of stricture that recurred after dilation with a bougie, which was completely relieved by a self-expandable metal stent.
