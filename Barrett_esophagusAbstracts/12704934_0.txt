Similar to squamous cell esophageal cancer, the lymph node status constitutes the major prognostic factor after complete tumor resection (R0-resection) in patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus (the so-called Barrett's cancer). Lymphatic spread in patients with Barrett's cancer, however, appears to follow certain rules. Lymphatic spread is closely correlated to the pT-category of the primary tumor, starts only after infiltration of the submucosa und is initially limited to the regional lymph nodes. Distant lymph node metastases are almost exclusively found in patients with multiple positive regional nodes, skipping of regional lymph nodes is rare. These observations set the stage for tailored lymphadenectomy-strategies based on the, sentinel-lymphadenectomy' concept.
