 PURPOSE: Surgical procedures for esophageal cancer and chronic pancreatitis are demanding and still characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Cases of one-stage combined operations on the pancreas and esophagus with a long-term follow-up are rarely reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present the case of a 54-year-old woman with a Barrett's carcinoma and an 8-year history of severe chronic pancreatitis complicated with multiple episodes of cholangitis and resistant to conservative treatment. RESULTS: After a successful one-stage operation consisting of esophagogastrectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy, a 30-month disease-free follow-up with a good quality of life has been observed. CONCLUSION: Complicated surgical procedures such as one-stage multiple organ resections may offer, in selected cases, satisfactory long-term results, provided that patients are treated at a high-volume center by a multidisciplinary team.
