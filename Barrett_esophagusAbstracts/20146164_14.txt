 BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for complete eradication of Barrett's esophagus has shown promise in trials conducted at predominantly tertiary academic centers; however less is known regarding outcomes in the community. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of RFA for Barrett's esophagus delivered in a community practice setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter registry conducted in community-based gastroenterology practices. Patients had confirmed intestinal metaplasia with or without dysplasia on biopsy of a Barrett's esophagus. Intervention was step-wise RFA with follow-up esophageal biopsies. Endpoints were histology-based; complete response was defined as all biopsies at most recent endoscopy negative for intestinal metaplasia (CR-IM) or dysplasia (CR-D). Three cohorts were reported: 1) safety cohort, all patients; 2) efficacy cohort A, patients with at least one biopsy session after initial treatment; 3) efficacy cohort B, patients with at least one biopsy session > or = 1 year after initial treatment. RESULTS: The safety cohort included 429 patients (71 % men, median age 59 years, median Barrett's segment 3.0 cm). There were no serious adverse events (bleeding, perforation, death), and a stricture occurred after 1.1 % of cases (2.1 % of patients). In efficacy cohort A (n = 338), CR-IM and CR-D were achieved in 72 % and 89 % of patients, respectively (median follow-up 9 months). In efficacy cohort B (n = 137), CR-IM and CR-D were achieved in 77 % and 100 % of patients, respectively (median follow-up 20 months). CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter registry conducted at four community-based practices, the observed safety and efficacy outcomes associated with RFA for Barrett's esophagus are comparable to those previously reported in multicenter trials from predominantly tertiary academic centers.
