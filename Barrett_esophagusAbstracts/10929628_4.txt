BACKGROUND: Up to 10% of patients with Barrett's esophagus develop adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus. Endoscopic surveillance is recommended. We studied the potential of Argon plasma coagulation (APC) for eradication of Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: Indication for APC was the histologic evidence of columnar epithelium with a length of > or = 2 cm, located proximal of the cardia and with the presence of goblet cells. Endoscopic therapy was performed using an Argonbeamer (Beamer 2, Erbe Company, TÃ¼bingen, Germany) under i.v. sedation and repeated in intervals of 2-3 weeks with the aim of complete eradication of Barrett's epithelium. One month after macroscopic Barrett eradication, superficial and deep biopsies were obtained every 2 cm in 4 quadrant technique to confirm the endoscopic aspect of complete eradication. RESULTS: We report our results (follow-up median: 12 mths., 3-25) in the first 12 patients (8m/4f, median age 57 yrs., 42-69) in which treatment was completed. In one case there was evidence of moderate dysplasia. A mean of 5 (4-11) sessions were required for complete Barrett eradication in 11 patients (median size of Barrett-segment: 4 cm, range 2-11), in one patient partial regression of 50% was observed treatment was discontinued after 17 sessions while only. Deep biopsies showed subepithelial columnar epithelium islands in one case, recurrence of Barrett occurred in 2 cases after 3 and 6 months. Under APC-treatment, 11/12 patients complained about retrosternal pain and odynophagia. No other complications were observed. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results indicate that APC is safe and effective to eradicate Barrett's epithelium. Follow-up in a larger number of patients is necessary to assess longterm results (Barrett recurrence, decrease in the incidence of the adenocarcinoma), before APC may generally be recommended.
