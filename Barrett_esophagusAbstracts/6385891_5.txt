A total of 82 patients with gastroesophageal reflux were consecutively treated with stapled, uncut gastroplasty and complete fundoplication over a 12-year period. The conditions treated included symptomatic reflux; esophageal stricture; massive hernia; collagen esophagus; short esophagus; Barrett's esophagus; recurrent, massive bleeding or anemia; small gastric remnant after gastrectomy; and acute volvulus. The transthoracic approach of stapled, uncut gastroplasty gives superb exposure. Outstanding features of the procedure are the safety and versatility resulting from the small amount of fundus required, no need either to ligate short gastric vessels or to suture the esophagus itself, and preservation of anatomical continuity between the wrapping fundus and the wrapped gastric tubular segment. There have been no deaths and no cases of anatomical or symptomatic recurrence in the series. Complications included some nondebilitating and mainly self-limiting symptoms.
