 BACKGROUND: Prevalence of Barrett's esophagus (BE) in Luoyang, China, has not been reported, and its pathogenesis is controversial. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the prevalence of BE and its underlying factors in the city of Luoyang. METHOD: This was a prospective study in one center. Many patients were analyzed using endoscopy who showed upper gastrointestinal symptoms between August 2006 and June 2007. In addition, the effect of apoptosis-related proteins and heat shock proteins upon BE's pathogenesis were also investigated by an immunohistochemical protocol. RESULTS: Prevalence of BE was at 4.55% and the mean age of those affected was about 10 years older than for esophagitis. Typical reflux symptoms were significantly lower than with esophagitis, whereas signs of caspase-3 and HSP105 elevation were significantly higher. Expression of TERT, HSP70 and HSP90Î± in BE cases was significantly lower than in esophagitis. However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups in expression of HSP27. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of BE is high in Luoyang, which could result from esophagitis despite typical reflux symptoms being relatively uncommon. Initiation and development of BE might be the result of accelerated proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation of original cells to intestinal epithelium.
