Several techniques are under development to diagnose oesophageal adenocarcinoma at an earlier stage. We have demonstrated the potential of Raman spectroscopy, an optical diagnostic technique, for the identification and classification of malignant changes. However, there is no clear recognition of the biochemical changes that distinguish between the different stages of disease. Our aim is to understand these changes through Raman mapping studies. Raman spectral mapping was used to analyse 20-microm sections of tissue from 29 snap-frozen oesophageal biopsies. Contiguous haematoxylin and eosin sections were reviewed by a consultant pathologist. Principal component analysis was used to identify the major differences between the spectra across each map. Pseudocolour score maps were generated and the peaks of corresponding loads identified enabling visualisation of the biochemical changes associated with malignancy. Changes were noted in the distribution of DNA, glycogen, lipids and proteins. The mean spectra obtained from selected regions demonstrate increased levels of glycogen in the squamous area compared with increased DNA levels in the abnormal region. Raman spectroscopy is a highly sensitive and specific technique for demonstration of biochemical changes in the carcinogenesis of Barrett's oesophagus. There is potential for in vivo application for real-time endoscopic optical diagnosis.
