Barrett's ulcer is thought to develop in the columnar epithelium of Barrett's esophagus. In our series there is evidence that at least some Barrett's ulcers develop in squamous epithelium which may correspond to islets within Barrett's esophagus; in other cases Barrett's mucosa may surround a preexisting reflux-induced ulcer and thus transform it into Barrett's ulcer. In some individual cases of Barrett's ulcer development of the ulcer primarily in the columnar epithelium could not be ruled out. These ulcers may be produced by local acid secretion, by acid or alkaline gastroesophageal reflux in patients with reduced resistance of the columnar epithelium. Exceptionally, Barrett's ulcer may result from local irritation by medication (pill-induced ulcer) or by nasogastric intubation.
