BACKGROUND: Endoscopic surveillance of patients with Barrett's oesophagus is recommended to detect early carcinoma. The practice patterns of endoscopists since the publication of more recent management guidelines remain unknown. METHODS: All endoscopists (n=68) in the Irish Medical Directory and their trainees were sent a postal questionnaire on Barrett's surveillance. RESULTS: Fifty-five per cent (30/54) perform surveillance on all patients with Barrett's oesophagus and 38% on selected patients. In patients with no dysplasia, repeat endoscopy was more commonly practiced annually (28/54) than every two to three years (23/54). Surgeons were more likely to perform surveillance annually than gastroenterologists (75% vs 40%). Only 26% of endoscopists took four-quadrant biopsies every 2 cm. Intervention was recommended by a majority (28/54) of endoscopists in a patient with high grade dysplasia. A majority of respondents (47/54) would have surveillance if they were found to have Barrett's oesophagus. CONCLUSION: Most endoscopists in Ireland do not adhere to recent guidelines in their management of Barrett's oesophagus. Surgical endoscopists perform surveillance more frequently than their medical colleagues.
