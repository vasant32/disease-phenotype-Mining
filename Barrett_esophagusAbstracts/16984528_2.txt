Esophageal dysmotility is common in patients with Barrett's esophagus. Previously we have reported deterioration of esophageal motility after photodynamic therapy (PDT) in a heterogeneous group of patients with esophageal carcinoma. This prospective study in consecutive patients describes changes in motility noted after endoscopic ablation. Forty-seven patients referred to our institution for endoscopic ablation for Barrett's high grade dysplasia or mucosal carcinoma between August 2001 and May 2003 were prospectively evaluated with esophageal manometry before and after porfimer sodium PDT. Six patients did not complete the study. Manometry results were classified as normal, diffuse esophageal spasm, ineffective esophageal motility, or aperistalsis. Abnormal esophageal motility was found in 14 of 47 (30%) patients at study entry ([diffuse esophageal spasm] DES-3, [ineffective esophageal motility] IEM-7, Aperistalsis-4). After PDT, 11 of 41 patients with paired studies experienced a change in manometric diagnosis. Three patients had an improvement in motility, seven a worsening and one changed diagnosis, but did not particularly worsen or improve. No patient developed new aperistalsis. Therefore, abnormal motility was present in 19 of 41 (46%) patients after PDT (DES-2, IEM-14, Aperistalsis-3). There was a statistically significant (P = 0.016) relationship with longer segment Barrett's esophagus and deterioration of function. Baseline abnormalities in motility can occur in patients with Barrett's high-grade dysplasia or mucosal carcinoma. Changes in esophageal function also may occur following photodynamic therapy, but usually are not clinically significant. Worsening in function was more likely to occur in patients with longer segment Barrett's esophagus.
