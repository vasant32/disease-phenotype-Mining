We describe a 12-year-old girl with Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) of 3 years' duration, who developed Barrett's esophagus with severe stricture. Barrett's esophagus complicating progressive systemic sclerosis has been reported in adult patients, but not in childhood. Barrett's esophagus following RP alone has not been reported, to the best of our knowledge, in any age group.
