Precise classification of cancers of the esophagogastric junction according to Siewert may be difficult for the presence of Barrett's esophagus or hiatal hernia, which subsequently leads to a difficult choice of the surgical procedure of esophagectomy or gastrectomy. Ninety-six patients with such cancers were operated on in our department in 7 years. Twenty-nine patients (30.2%), classified as type I (group 1), underwent a transthoracic esophagectomy with gastric pull up. Sixty-seven patients (69.8%) classified as type II or III (group 2) underwent an extended gastrectomy. We compared the patients of both groups retrospectively for disease-free survival and postoperative complications. The general performance status of most patients was comparable in both groups and was assigned to the American Society of Anesthesiologists class II or III. Statistically significant differences between the groups were seen for the postoperative reintubation rate [group 1: 31.0% vs. group 2: 9.0% (P = 0.009)], median time for surgery [group 1: 6 (3.5-8.5) hours vs. group 2: 4.7 (2.2-11.5) hours (P = 0.001)], time in the intensive care unit [group 1: 6 (3-85) days vs. group 2: 3 (1-54) days (P = 0.001)], median hospitalization time [group 1: 23 (14-105) days vs. group 2: 18 (10-63) days (P = 0.018)]. No statistical difference was observed for the recurrence-free survival of 40% after 3 years (P = 0.311), the mortality rate, the morbidity rate (P = 0.108), surgical and respiratory complications, and the incidence of anastomotic leakage (P = 0.645). We conclude that in selected cases it may be possible to perform an extended gastrectomy for small type I cancers.
