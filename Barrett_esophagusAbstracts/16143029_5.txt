Columnar-lined esophagus is composed of intestinal type and gastric type epithelium. Only the specialized or intestinal type columnar epithelium is susceptible to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The aim of the present paper was to evaluate the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES) in gastric-type and intestinal-type metaplasia in columnar-lined esophagus and compare these with cell proliferation. Biopsy specimens of 30 columnar-lined esophagus patients were collected, and immunohistochemistry was performed for secretory mucins (MUC2, MUC5AC), COX, mPGES and cell proliferation (Ki-67). The MUC2-positive area had higher COX-2 expression and cell proliferation than the MUC5AC-positive area. There was a close correlation between COX-2 expression and cell proliferation. In contrast, the expression of COX-1, mPGES-1 and -2 was similar between intestinal metaplasia and gastric metaplasia. In conclusion, intestinal-type columnar-lined esophagus possesses COX-2 expression and a higher proliferation potential, suggesting that esophageal adenocarcinoma may arise from specialized columnar-lined esophagus.
