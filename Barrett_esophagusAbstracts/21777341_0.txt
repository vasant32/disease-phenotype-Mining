To assess adherence to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment and associated variables in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Cross-sectional and prospective comprising 240 consecutive adult patients, diagnosed with GERD for whom continuous use of standard or double dose of omeprazole had been prescribed. Patients were ranked as ne-GERD (162: 67.5%) or e-GERD classified according to the Los Angeles classification as A (48:20.0%), B (21:8.6%), C (1:0.5%), D (1:0.5%), and Barrett's esophagus (7:2.9%). The Morisky questionnaire was applied to assess adherence to therapy and a GERD questionnaire to assess symptoms and their impact. Adherence was correlated with demographics, cotherapies, comorbidities, treatment duration, symptoms scores, endoscopic findings, and patient awareness of their disease. 126 patients (52.5%) exhibited high level of adherence and 114 (47.5%) low level. Youngers (P= 0.002) or married (O.R. 2.41, P= 0.03 vs. widowers) patients had lower levels of adherence; symptomatic patients exhibited lower adherence (P= 0.02). All other variables studied had no influence on adherence. Patients with GERD attending a tertiary referral hospital in SÃ£o Paulo exhibited a high rate of low adherence to the prescribed PPI therapy that may play a role in the therapy failure. Age <60 years, marital status and being symptomatic were risk factors for low adherence.
