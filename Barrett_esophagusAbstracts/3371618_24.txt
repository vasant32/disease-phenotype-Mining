Campylobacter pylori organisms were found with similar frequency in the stomachs of patients with Barrett's esophagus and in age- and sex-matched controls (10 of 26 vs. 11 of 26). Campylobacter pylori was also observed in esophageal Barrett's mucosa in some patients with gastric C. pylori, but not when gastric infection was absent (4 of 10 vs. 0 of 16). Campylobacter pylori was not detected in esophageal squamous mucosa from patients with Barrett's esophagus or in 25 non-Barrett's patients with gastric C. pylori and histologic changes of esophageal reflux. Overall frequency of ulceration in Barrett's esophagus was 35% (9 of 26), and frequency of ulceration was similar whether or not C. pylori was noted in gastric or Barrett's mucosa.
