 BACKGROUND: The role of upper endoscopy (EGD) in obese patients prior to bariatric surgery is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic yield and cost of routine EGD before bariatric surgery. METHODS: The medical records of consecutive obese patients who underwent EGD prior to bariatric surgery between May 2000 and September 2002 were reviewed. Two experienced endoscopists reviewed all EGD reports, and findings were divided into 4 groups based on predetermined criteria: group 0 (normal study), group 1 (abnormal findings that neither changed the surgical approach nor postponed surgery), group 2 (abnormal findings that changed the surgical approach or postponed surgery), and group 3 (results that were an absolute contraindication to surgery). Clinically important findings included lesions in groups 2 and 3. The cost of EGD (430.72 US dollars) was estimated using the endoscopist fee under Medicare reimbursement. RESULTS: During the 28-month study period, 195 patients were evaluated by EGD prior to bariatric surgery. One or more lesions were identified in 89.7% of patients, with 61.5% having a clinically important finding. The prevalence of endoscopic findings using the classification system above was as follows: group 0 (10.3%), group 1 (28.2%), group 2 (61.5%), and group 3 (0.0%). Overall, the most common lesions identified were hiatal hernia (40.0%), gastritis (28.7%), esophagitis (9.2%), gastric ulcer (3.6%), Barrett's esophagus (3.1%), and esophageal ulcer (3.1%). The cost of performing routine endoscopy on all patients prior to bariatric surgery was 699.92 US dollars per clinically important lesion detected. CONCLUSIONS: Routine upper endoscopy before bariatric surgery has a high diagnostic yield and has a low cost per clinically important lesion detected.
