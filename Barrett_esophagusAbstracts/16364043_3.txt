Minimally invasive techniques are increasingly being used for oesophagectomy. Diaphragmatic hernia is a rare complication of gastroplasty in open surgery. One of the advantages of the laparoscopic technique, the lack of peritoneal adhesions, may lead to an increased rate of this complication. We report two cases of diaphragmatic acute massive herniation after laparoscopic gastroplasty for esophagectomy out of a series of 44 laparoscopic gastroplasties performed over 33 months. We discuss some technical aspects related to its occurrence. Prevention should include a limited crural division and fixation of the gastric tube to the diaphragmatic crura at primary surgery.
