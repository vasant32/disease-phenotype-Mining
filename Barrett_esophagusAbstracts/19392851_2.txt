It is proposed that epithelial changes induced by gastroesophageal reflux disease are related to the pH environment of the esophageal lumen. We hypothesized that the various types of esophageal epithelium are associated with specific pH environments that induce their formation. The aim of this study was to compare the luminal pH environment to the histology of the distal esophageal epithelium in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. A total of 197 symptomatic patients with increased esophageal acid exposure on 24-hour pH monitoring were grouped according to the histology based on biopsies from the distal esophagus: 17 with squamous epithelium, 126 with cardiac epithelium (CE), and 54 with Barrett's epithelium (BE). All were free of Helicobacter pylori infection and monitored off acid suppression therapy. Acid exposure was expressed as the percent of time the luminal pH was at intervals of 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, and 6-7 over a 24-hour period. Patients with BE spent significantly more time at pH intervals 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5 than those with CE. This pattern switched at pH interval 5-6, where patients with cardiac mucosa spent more time than those with BE. Patients with squamous and CE had similar pH exposure at all intervals. Patients with BE have significantly longer exposure time at the pH interval of 2 to 5 compared to those with cardiac and squamous epithelium. This suggests that the exposure of stem cells to a luminal pH between 2 and 5 may trigger the differentiation of CE into intestinalized CE.
