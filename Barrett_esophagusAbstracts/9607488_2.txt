The authors report a case of a 13-year-old girl with Barrett's esophagus who underwent antireflux surgery and was subsequently treated with endoscopic thermal coagulation using bipolar electrocoagulation. Follow-up endoscopy 15 months after completion of the endoscopic therapy showed normal esophageal mucosa without intestinal metaplasia. Longer follow-up is needed to assess the long-term effects of endoscopic treatment of the Barrett's mucosa with thermal coagulation, and this procedure should still be considered under investigation.
