Acid, pepsin and other noxious material reach the esophageal mucosa and interact with the luminal aspect of the squamous epithelium. The first protective barrier to these potentially injurious substances is the mucus buffer layer that covers the mucosa. In healthy people, the esophagus has a protective surface adherent mucus gel barrier. Levels of mucin glycoprotein are considerably increased in response to acid and pepsin. A wide spectrum of mucin genes are expressed in normal esophageal mucosa, squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, Barrett epithelium and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The mucins MUC5AC and MUC6 are expressed to a similar degree in Barrett metaplasia and gastric mucosa, as is MUC2 in Barrett intestinal metaplasia and small bowel mucosa. Increased expression of MUC1 is associated with progression from dysplasia to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Thus, mucins have an important role in the defense of esophageal mucosa against the acid, pepsin and bile that are present in the refluxate. Changes in the expression of mucins occur in patients with GERD, and might lead to the development of new drugs.
