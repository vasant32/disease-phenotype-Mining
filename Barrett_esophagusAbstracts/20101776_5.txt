 AIM: To test the hypothesis that the shape and length of Barrett's epithelium are associated with prevalence of erosive esophagitis. METHODS: A total study population comprised 869 patients who underwent endoscopy during a health checkup at our hospital. The presence and extent of Barrett's epithelium were diagnosed based on the Prague C & M Criteria. We originally classified cases of Barrett's epithelium into two types based on its shape, namely, flame-like and lotus-like Barrett's epithelium, and into two groups based on its length, its C extent < 2 cm, and > or = 2 cm. Correlation of shape and length of Barrett's epithelium with erosive esophagitis was examined. RESULTS: Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed in 374 cases (43%). Most of these were diagnosed as short-segment Barrett's epithelium. The prevalence of erosive esophagitis was significantly higher in subjects with flame-like than lotus-like Barrett's epithelium, and in those with a C extent of > or = 2 cm than < 2 cm. CONCLUSION: Flame-like rather than lotus-like Barrett's epithelium, and Barrett's epithelium with a longer segment were more strongly associated with erosive esophagitis.
