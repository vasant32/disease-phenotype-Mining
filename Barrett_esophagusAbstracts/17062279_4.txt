Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a commonly performed procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity. Esophagectomy in patients with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass presents a difficult technical challenge for the surgeon. In this report we describe a technique of minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy in a patient who had had an open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Minimally invasive esophagectomy was performed with resection of the Roux limb using the gastric remnant as the conduit for gastrointestinal reconstruction.
