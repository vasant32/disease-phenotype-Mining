Columnar cell lined lower oesophagus (CELLO), often considered to be a precancerous lesion, is characterized by a glandular mucosa with a predominance of sulphomucins in the specialized epithelium. This histochemical abnormality can be correlated with abnormal differentiation which may also be studied by anti-mucus antibodies (anti-M1, anti-M3, anti-SIMA, anti-LIMA). The purpose of this prospective study is to define the mucin profile in a large population of CELLO by immunohistochemistry and to compare it with the results of histochemistry. Biopsies of 79 patients with reflux oesophagitis were included. Thirty-eight had CELLO and 41 had a histologically normal cardia. Six surgical specimens of oesophageal adenocarcinomas were also included. The histochemical methods confirmed the preponderance (57.9%) of type III intestinal metaplasia (IM) found in 57.9% of cases. The immunohistochemical methods showed a similar antigenic profile of type II and III IM with positivity of anti-SIMA and anti-M3 antibodies in the goblet cells, and positivity of anti-LIMA antibodies in both the goblet and intermediate cells of the specialized epithelium. The mucus secreting cells of the oesophageal adenocarcinomas had the same immunohistochemical profile. These results are similar to those of Filipe et al. in type II and III IM surrounding gastric adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemical methods allow us to subdivide type II and type III IM into 2 subgroups according to the positivity or negativity of the anti-LIMA antibodies in the intermediate cells. Among the 41 normal cardias in patients with reflux oesophagitis, 10 contain sulphomucin secreting cells positive with anti-LIMA antibodies. We suggest that this anti-LIMA positivity may be a step preceding type III IM in specialized epithelium.
