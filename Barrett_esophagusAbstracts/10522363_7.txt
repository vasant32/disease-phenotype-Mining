26 patients with a Barrett's esophagus of at least 2 cm length (medium 4.9 cm) were treated with a combination of repeated argon-plasma-coagulation (APC) and a long-term acid suppression using proton pump inhibitors controlled by a 2 h pH monitoring. Eleven out of 26 patients (42%) showed endoscopically and histologically a complete eradication of the metaplastic cylindric epithelium (intention--to treat analysis). Nine patients (35%) had an endoscopic complete remission but remnants of the cylindric epithelium were found at the histologic examination. On an average one APC-session was necessary for 1 cm of initial length of the Barrett's esophagus. No serious complications were seen. It remains unclear if this therapy can reduce the long-term risks for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in patients with Barrett's esophagus.
