 AIM: To report the endoscopic treatment of large hyperplastic polyps of the esophagus and esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) associated with Barrett's esophagus (BE) with low-grade dysplasia (LGD), by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). METHODS: Cap fitted EMR (EMR-C) was performed in 3 patients with hyperplastic-inflammatory polyps (HIPs) and BE. RESULTS: The polyps were successfully removed in the 3 patients. In two patients, with short segment BE (SSBE) (<= 3 cm), the metaplastic tissue was completely excised. A 2 cm circumferential EMR was performed in one patient with a polyp involving the whole EGJ. A simultaneous EMR-C of a BE-associated polypoid dysplastic lesion measuring 1 cm multiply 10 cm, was also carried out. In the two patients, histologic assessment detected LGD in BE. No complications occurred. Complete neosquamous re-epithelialization occurred in the two patients with SSBE. An esophageal recurrence occurred in the remaining one and was successfully retreated by EMR. CONCLUSION: EMR-C appears to be a safe and effective method for treating benign esophageal mucosal lesions, allowing also the complete removal of SSBE.
