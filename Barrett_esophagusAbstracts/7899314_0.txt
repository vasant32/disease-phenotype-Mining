Barrett's oesophagus is a condition in which a metaplastic columnar mucosa replaces the normal squamous epithelium of the lower oesophagus. Barrett's oesophagus develops as a complication of gastro-oesophageal reflux and predisposes to the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Most adenocarcinomas arising in Barrett's mucosa are far advanced at the time of diagnosis, and prognosis is consequently poor. Regular endoscopic surveillance of patients with Barrett's oesophagus is recommended to detect the oesophageal malignancy in an early presymptomatic stage. The concept of screening is based on the notion that regular surveillance can reduce the mortality, but there is yet little evidence that this is the case in Barrett's oesophagus. Screening is generally carried out by regular endoscopy with multiple biopsies in an attempt to detect dysplasia. Unfortunately, dysplasia is not an ideal biomarker of malignant potential in Barrett's oesophagus. There is an interest in research into more sensitive and effective predictors of heightened risk for development of malignancy. DNA content flow cytometry and p53 protein expression might be useful in managing the cancer risk in Barrett's patients. However these new techniques need further evaluation before they can be applied to routine clinical investigation.
