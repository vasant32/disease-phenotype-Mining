Of 70 patients with achalasia and related motor disorders, 3 developed Barrett's esophagus 5, 8, and 15 years after esophagomyotomy. One of the three had dysplastic changes in the Barrett's mucosa. Although an increased incidence of gastroesophageal reflux, esophagitis, and stricture are well-known complications after esophagomyotomy, the development of Barrett's mucosa has been only recently recognized. Diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus in such patients is difficult and requires a high index of awareness by the radiologist and an endoscopic biopsy for definitive diagnosis. The cumulative effects of achalasia and Barrett's esophagus predispose these patients to higher risks of developing esophageal carcinoma.
