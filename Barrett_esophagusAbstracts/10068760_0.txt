Pancreatic metaplasia in Barrett's esophagus was originally described by Krishnamurthy et al. They found that these focal clusters of cells resemble pancreatic acinar cells by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Wang et al one year later, described these same cell clusters in normal and inflamed gastroesophageal junction. We studied 318 cases diagnosed as Barrett's esophagus (199 cases) and chronic esophagitis (119 cases) in the ABC Medical Center seen in 1996 and the first four months of 1997, to look for pancreatic acinar metaplasia. We found 14 cases of Barrett's esophagus and 11 cases of chronic esophagitis with pancreatic acinar metaplasia. By immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy that these cell clusters are actually acinar pancreatic cells. Our results are in keeping with those found by Krishnamurthy and Wang that the clusters represent pancreatic acinar cells and may be found in Barrett's esophagus and in chronic esophagitis. The significance of these findings remain to be elucidated.
