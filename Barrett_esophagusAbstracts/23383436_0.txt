The histological features and morphogenesis of acute peptic mucosal lesions in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were studied using 2220 biopsy specimens obtained from 669 patients. The stages of their development and two variants of their healing, which affected the duration and outcome of the disease, were identified. Acute erosions and ulcers in the laminated squamous and cylindrical epithelial areas were shown to be a natural stage of changes that preceded the development of Barrett esophagus and promoted its progression. All the described changes must be embodied in the histological reports on esophageal mucosal biopsy specimens and taken into consideration when using local and systemic treatments.
