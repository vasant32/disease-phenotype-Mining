 BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new device for endoscopic monopolar electrocoagulation and to develop ablative techniques by using this new device. METHODS: The new device consists of an overtube with a wire mesh electrode in an oval opening in the distal end and a balloon at the distal end. High-frequency electrical current was applied in 5 animal (swine) esophagi by using this specially designed monopolar electrocoagulation device. A total of 32 "lesions" were ablated by using blend electrosurgical waveforms for different time durations. The esophagi were then resected for histopathologic evaluation. RESULTS: Histopathologic study of the ablated lesions demonstrated that, by using the monopolar electrocoagulation device, different levels of degeneration of the mucosa and submucosa were achieved. The method for use of the device is fast and easy to apply. CONCLUSIONS: The ablative procedure with the new overtube device is minimally invasive, clearly feasible, and easy to apply. This new device potentially can be used in patients for tissue ablation.
