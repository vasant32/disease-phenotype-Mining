Barrett's esophagus (BE) is considered to be a disease of white males with a prevalence ranging from 0.5 to 4.0% in patients undergoing upper endoscopy (EGD) for any indication, and from 12 to 15% in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The prevalence of BE in Hispanics is not known, but it is assumed to be lower. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of BE in Hispanic patients and to compare demographic and endoscopic characteristics with Caucasian patients with BE. Records of patients undergoing an EGD between October 1993 and October 1996 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included in the study only if they had columnar-appearing esophageal mucosa at endoscopy and intestinal metaplasia with Alcian blue-staining goblet cells on biopsy. An extensive chart review was performed in patients with BE. There were 75 new cases of BE discovered: 60 (80%) were Caucasians, 6 (8%) Hispanics, 1 (1.4%) Native American, and 8 (10.6%) patients with either unknown or unconfirmed ethnicity. Of the 75 patients, 74 male, and the mean age was 65 +/- 11.4 years (range 36-92 years). The prevalence of BE in Caucasians and Hispanics undergoing EGD for any reason was similar (5.3% and 3.8%, respectively, P = 0.563). The prevalence of BE in patients presenting with GERD symptoms was also similar between Caucasians and Hispanics (25% and 16%, respectively, P = 0.304). The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to age, symptoms, habits, or endoscopic findings. In conclusion, the prevalence of BE among Hispanic patients is similar to Caucasian patients, an unexpected finding.
