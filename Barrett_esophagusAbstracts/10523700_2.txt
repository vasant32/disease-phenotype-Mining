In Japan, Barrett's esophageal cancer is a very rare disease. We examined clinicopathologically and immunohistologically 4 patients with Barrett's esophageal cancer who underwent surgical resection in our department. Barrett's esophageal mucosa was classified into 3 types for detailed observation. Specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) remained on the orifice side of carcinoma, and progression to adenocarcinoma was observed in some dysplastic glands. positive findings were detected on p53 immunohistochemical staining, and the ki-67 labeling index was higher than other types. SCE-type Barrett's esophagus may be a precancerous lesion arising prior to the development of adenocarcinoma.
