 BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate clinicopathologic differences between Type II and Type III groups that were classified by Siewert in cardia cancer. METHODS: A hundred forty-one patients who were diagnosed as gastric cardia cancer and underwent surgery between January 1990 and December 2006 by single surgeon at Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine were included in this study. The Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: Barrett's adenocarcinoma was recognized in two patients so called type I. There were significant differences between type II and III in aspect of depth of invasion, Lauren's classification, and the number of retrieved lymph nodes in which cancer infiltrated. In type III, prognostic factors affecting survival were depth of invasion and nodal status in contrast to the no demonstrable prognostic factors existing in type II. However, there were no differences in recurrence and survival between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Several clinicopathologic differences exist between type II and III cardia cancer. In the future, further evaluation is needed regarding the classification and entities of the cardia cancer.
