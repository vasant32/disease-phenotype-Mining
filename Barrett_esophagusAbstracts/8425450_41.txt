Consistent regression of intestinal metaplasia in Barrett's esophagus has not been achieved with medical or surgical interventions. In this case report, a patient with Barrett's esophagus of stable length had half the circumference of the Barrett's epithelium ablated with laser therapy while on a high-dose proton-pump inhibitor. In the absence of esophageal acid exposure and after laser ablation, the intestinal metaplasia was documented to reepithelialize with normal squamous mucosa, which has persisted.
