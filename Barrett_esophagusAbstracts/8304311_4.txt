OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to correlate clinical and pathologic features of squamous cell papillomas of the human esophagus and investigate their pathogenesis and malignant potential. METHODS: Clinical and pathologic data on 25 patients were studied. RESULTS: All patients in whom the race was known were white, and the majority of lesions occurred in the distal esophagus. There were multiple lesions in five cases. Many cases showed endoscopic evidence of hiatus hernia, gastroesophageal reflux, or esophagitis. No examples of Barrett esophagus were found. No esophageal malignancies occurred, and no dysplasia was seen histologically. Evidence of recurrence was found in only two patients, but several synchronous or metachronous carcinomas of the oro-respiratory tract occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings do not exclude a viral etiology, they suggest a role for mucosal injury and regeneration in the pathogenesis of these lesions. The association with other malignancies may be significant.
