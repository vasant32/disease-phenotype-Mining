BACKGROUND: & Aims: Central adiposity has been implicated as a risk factor for Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), possibly promoting the progression from inflammation to metaplasia and neoplasia. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to evaluate the association between central adiposity and erosive esophagitis (EE), BE, and EAC, specifically exploring body mass index (BMI)-independent and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)-independent effects of central adiposity on the risk of these outcomes. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of multiple databases through March 2013. Studies were included if they reported effect of central adiposity (visceral adipose tissue area, waist-hip ratio, and/or waist circumference) on the risk of EE, BE, and EAC. Summary-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI), comparing highest category of adiposity to the lowest category of adiposity, were calculated using random-effects model. RESULTS: Forty relevant articles were identified. Compared to patients with normal body habitus, patients with central adiposity had a higher risk of EE (19 studies; aOR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.51-2.31) and BE (17 studies; aOR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.52-2.57). The association between central adiposity and BE persisted after adjusting for BMI (5 studies; aOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.20-2.95). Reflux-independent association of central adiposity and BE was observed in studies that used GERD patients as controls or adjusted for GERD symptoms (11 studies; aOR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.44-2.90). In 6 studies, central adiposity was associated with a higher risk of EAC (aOR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.54-4.06), compared to normal body habitus. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a meta-analysis, central adiposity, independent of BMI, promotes the progression of esophageal inflammation (EE) to metaplasia (BE) and neoplasia (EAC). Its effects are mediated by reflux-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
