The management of Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia is controversial. The standard of care has traditionally been esophagectomy. However, a number of treatment options aimed at esophageal preservation are increasingly being utilized by many centers. These esophageal-sparing approaches include endoscopic surveillance, mucosal ablation, and endoscopic mucosal resection. In this guideline we review the best evidence supporting these commonly used strategies for high-grade dysplasia to better define management and guide future investigation.
