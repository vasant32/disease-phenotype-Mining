BACKGROUND/AIMS: The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus has increased. Its major risk factor is Barrett's epithelium of which the sine qua non is microscopically diagnosed intestinal metaplasia. Short segment Barrett's epithelium may often be overlooked during routine endoscopy. In routine biopsies taken from normal-appearing mucosa of the distal oesophagus, the reported rates of short segment Barrett's epithelium in the distal oesophagus reached 36%. We compared these rates with the results obtained in a community hospital in Israel. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing oesophagogastroduodenoscopy were enrolled. Biopsy specimens taken from cardia, oesophagogastric junction and 2 cm above the oesophagogastric junction were stained with haematoxylin & eosin and Alcian blue. RESULTS: There were 112 study patients (mean age +/- SD 48. 9+/-18.3 years, 51.8% males). Nine (8.04%) patients had intestinal metaplasia (according to specimen from 2 cm above oesophagogastric junction), and symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux were found in only four (44.4%) of them. Of these nine patients, six (6.66%) had normal-appearing mucosa and three (3.33%) had macroscopic Barrett's epithelium. Alcian blue staining revealed two patients with intestinal metaplasia that haematoxylin & eosin staining had missed. CONCLUSION: We found an 8% prevalence of intestinal metaplasia compared to 18-36% reported in the literature. We also determined that the added advantage of routine biopsy was 5.4%.
