INTRODUCTION: Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is the main risk factor for the development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (AC). The aim of our study was to evaluate symptoms of patients with AC to identify those patients with a high risk for this tumour. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 117 consecutive patients with known AC were included. Prospectively all patients were interviewed with a standardised questionnaire comprising 120 items: social status, other diseases, risk factors, therapy of the GERD and, as a main part: current symptoms and those experienced at earlier times. RESULTS: 85 % of the patients had often or sometimes reflux symptoms. 46 % of the patients with reflux symptoms had such symptoms daily. The median time span for this symptom was 20 years with a range from 1 year to 50 years. In 21 % of the patients the reflux symptoms stopped (median) three years (range two months -- 30 years) before the diagnosis of the carcinoma. Only 55 % of all patients had one or more esophago-gastroscopy examinations before the diagnosis of AC. These patients showed significantly more often earlier tumour stages than those patients without an endoscopy before diagnosis. Heartburn was treated with medication in 78 % of the patients (67 % of all patients). No patient had previously undergone antireflux surgery. CONCLUSIONS: 15 % of the patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus show no, and in addition 25 % only discrete, heartburn; 1. an endoscopy due to heartburn was done in half of all cases, and 2. the medications do not fulfil the therapeutic standard; 3.patients with endoscopy had significantly more frequently an earlier tumour stage.
