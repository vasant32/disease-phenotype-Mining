Gastroesophageal reflux disease is generally a lifelong illness that affects many people. Erosive esophagitis can occur in up to 65% of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and more seriously, esophageal stricture, Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, can develop. The severity of symptoms is not a reliable indicator of the severity of erosive esophagitis and although endoscopy is the preferred method to diagnose and grade erosive esophagitis, its routine use is not practical. Therefore, early initiation of treatment with the most effective agent for treating this disease is a practical and logical strategy. Proton pump inhibitor therapy is preferred for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. This review provides a quantitative assessment of the efficacy of esomeprazole (Nexium, AstraZeneca), the most effective agent currently available.
