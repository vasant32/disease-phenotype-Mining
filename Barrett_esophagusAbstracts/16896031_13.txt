Barrett's esophagus is a useful model for the study of carcinogenesis, as the metaplastic columnar epithelium that replaces squamous esophageal epithelium is at elevated risk for development of adenocarcinoma. We examined telomere length and chromosomal instability (CIN) in Barrett's esophagus biopsies using fluorescence in situ hybridization. To study CIN, we selected centromere and locus-specific arm probes to chromosomes 17/17p (p53), 11/11q (cyclin D1), and 9/9p (p16 INK4A), loci reported to be involved in early stages of Barrett's esophagus neoplasia. Telomere shortening was observed in Barrett's esophagus epithelium at all histologic grades, whereas CIN was highest in biopsies with dysplastic changes; there was, however, considerable heterogeneity between patients in each variable. Alterations on chromosome 17 were strongly correlated with telomere length (r = 0.55; P < 0.0001) and loss of the 17p arm signal was the most common event. CIN on chromosome 11 was also associated with telomere shortening (r =0.3; P = 0.05), although 11q arm gains were most common. On chromosome 9p, arm losses were the most common finding, but chromosome 9 CIN was not strongly correlated with telomere length. We conclude that CIN is related to telomere shortening in Barrett's esophagus but varies by chromosome. Whether instability is manifested as loss or gain seems to be influenced by the chromosomal loci involved. Because telomere shortening and CIN are early events in Barrett's esophagus neoplastic progression and are highly variable among patients, it will be important to determine whether they identify a subset of patients that is at risk for more rapid neoplastic evolution.
