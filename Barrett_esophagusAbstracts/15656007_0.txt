The frequency of gastroesophageal reflux disease is on a constant rise in western countries. Reflux therapy can be subdivided into the treatment of acute erosive reflux esophagitis and the subsequent recurrence prophylaxis, and into the treatment of non-erosive reflux disease as well as the atypical reflux symptoms. Based on conventional large-scale studies, a highly effective therapy is available which offers virtually complete acid blockade using proton pump inhibitors (PPI) of the prazole type. Used for acute treatment, they offer a cure for reflux esophagitis and freedom from symptoms in approx. 90% of the cases, while also showing high efficacy in recurrence prophylaxis. Conversely, the rate of side effects, particularly serious ones, is very low and the long-term safety of this therapy has been good. Since the risk of erosive reflux esophagitis recurring is > 80% without PPI therapy, the majority of the patients will require a long-term, potentially even life-long therapy with PPI. Other therapeutic options are being discussed as alternatives to such long-term prophylaxis. In selected cases, surgical therapy by laparoscopic fundoplication is one option. Alternatively, endoscopical anti-reflux procedures are increasingly coming into use; their merit in long-term prophylaxis however, cannot yet be evaluated. Whenever PPI therapy does not lead to complete freedom from symptoms, an alternative therapeutic approach should be given consideration even in patients with atypical reflux symptoms. The therapy of the Barrett's esophagus, a potentially long-term sequelae of reflux disease, will not be dealt with in this overview, as it is the subject of a separate presentation.
