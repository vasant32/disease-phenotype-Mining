Adenocarcinoma of the cervical esophagus is a rare tumor, in comparison to adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus which is on the rise and is often associated with Barrett's esophagus. We present a case of aggressive cervical esophageal adenocarcinoma in a 46-year-old female with no endoscopic or histopathologic evidence of Barrett's esophagus. We discuss the possible etiology of this tumor and review the treatment options, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the management of this rare disease.
