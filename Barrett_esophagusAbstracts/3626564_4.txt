Of 163 patients with carcinomas of the esophagus seen between 1975 and 1982, 11 (6.7%) had a primary adenocarcinoma. Although the high ratio of men to women (10:1) was similar to that seen in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, the mean age of those with adenocarcinoma was younger (57 years). In contrast to squamous cell carcinomas, which predominantly involve blacks, esophageal adenocarcinomas in these patients involved only Caucasians. The great majority of lesions were found in the lower third of the esophagus. Only 3 (27%) of the patients with adenocarcinomas gave a history of a large daily alcohol consumption and only 2 (18%) had a Barrett's esophagus. Although various combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy could control the primary tumor rather well, the final results were poor. All patients have now expired; median survival time was 16 months.
