Previous studies have demonstrated multifocal neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. We evaluated 213 mapped, flow-purified, endoscopic biopsies to determine the distribution of p53-mutant clones in the Barrett's segments of 58 patients who had high-grade dysplasia without cancer. Twenty-nine patients (50%) had p53 mutations in their Barrett's segments, including 3 patients with multiple distinct p53 mutations. p53-mutant clones, including diploid cell populations, underwent expansion from 1 to 9 cm in the Barrett's segment. In 12 of 29 patients (41%) with a p53 mutation, the same mutation was found at every evaluated level of the metaplastic epithelium. This extensive p53-mutant clonal expansion suggests a somatic genetic basis for previous observations of field effects in Barrett's esophagus.
