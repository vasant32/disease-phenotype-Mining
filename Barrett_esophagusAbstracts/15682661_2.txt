One hundred and five patients were included in the study; forty seven patients had evidence of reflux oesophagitis, 61.7% of whom had grade B oesophagitis according to the modified Los Angeles classification and 10.6% had Barrett's oesophagus. 78.7% of the biopsies from the esophageal cardia revealed presenced of inflammation (Carditis). Dysplasia was documented in 21.3% of these biopsies. Helicobacter pylori was detected 59.6% of gastrooesophageal reflux disease patients and 56.8% of patients with carditis.
