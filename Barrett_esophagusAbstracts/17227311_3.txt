We reported four families with familial Barrett's esophagus (FBE) in 1993. This follow-up study includes an additional 16 families with FBE, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and BE-related adenocarcinoma (BEAC) highlighting the familial trends of inheritance. A retrospective survey of endoscopic and histopathological reports on 95 confirmed cases of BE from 1975 to 2005 was performed and a detailed family history was obtained. Five representative pedigrees from a total of 20 are discussed here. These 20 families represent one of the largest cohorts studied over three decades from a single institution. Familial BE is more common than previously thought and the prevalence of GERD, BE and BEAC in these families is distinctly higher than with sporadic cases. The conditions appear to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance. Hence diligence in taking family history with BE patients is critical since the endoscopic screening of relatives is warranted in FBE. Earlier diagnosis and surveillance of FBE should hopefully improve outcomes.
