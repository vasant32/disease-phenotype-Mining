A case of the "Barrett syndrome" in a patient with severe ulcerating reflux oesophagitis is reported. Evidence indicating that it is an acquired condition caused by reflux of bile-contaminated gastric juice is presented. The "Barrett ulcer" and the oesophagitis healed following a partial gastrectomy with a Roux-en Y gastrojejunostomy. The substitution of the squamous epithelium of the lower 15 cm of the oesophagus by columnar epithelium of cardia type is apparently irreversible.
