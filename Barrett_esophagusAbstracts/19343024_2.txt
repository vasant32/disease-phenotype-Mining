The identification of patients with "bad Barrett's" who are at risk of neoplastic progression is a vital and pressing task. The view that specialized intestinal metaplasia with goblet cells is the predominant preneoplastic phenotype has had wide, but by no means universal, acceptance. An important caveat is presented in the thoughtful paper by Liu et al. in this issue. Of 68 patients with columnar metaplasia, 22 patients had no goblet cells identified and 46 had goblet cells in their biopsies. In both groups there were chromosomal and DNA content abnormalities and genetic instability. However, there were no significant differences between these cellular DNA abnormalities in the two groups. Both were significantly different from gastric controls. Thus, all metaplasia in the columnar-lined esophagus may already be on the path to cancer.
