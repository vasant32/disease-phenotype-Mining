The development of a cancer of the esophagus in women who previously had received radiotherapy for breast cancer is a known although infrequent event. The risk of apparition of the second neoplasia is greater in women who survive at least ten years after the exposition to the radiation. Squamous cell carcinoma is the histological subtype more frequent. We report a case of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in a man diagnosed of benign symmetrical lipomatosis (Madelung' disease), who had received adjuvant radiotherapy three years before for breast cancer.
