 BACKGROUND: Quality of life, poor in patients with reflux disease, improves significantly after an antireflux operation. The aim of this study was to determine the relative importance of the operative approach used for a fundoplication, as well as the successful elimination of reflux symptoms on long-term quality of life in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: A questionnaire, including the medical outcome study short-form health survey (SF-36), was completed by 105 patients who had undergone either a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (n = 72) or a transthoracic Nissen fundoplication (n = 33); median follow-up was 25 and 31 months, respectively. Patients were classified as completely or incompletely relieved of reflux symptoms based on the frequency of reflux symptoms and the use of acid-suppression medication. RESULTS: Patients selected for transthoracic Nissen fundoplication had significantly worse preoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease based on the presence of a large hiatal hernia, Barrett's esophagus, or stricture. Long-term quality of life was similar for the two approaches, but was significantly decreased in patients with recurrent reflux symptoms. Compared with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication patients, transthoracic Nissen fundoplication patients were less likely to use acid-suppression medication and tended to be more satisfied with their operation. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term quality of life was independent of the invasiveness of the procedure, but significantly dependent on successful elimination of reflux symptoms and the necessity for acid suppression medication. Patients who underwent a transthoracic Nissen fundoplication, despite having more advanced disease preoperatively, tended to have less reflux symptoms and less long-term acid-suppression medication usage after their procedure. These findings support the continued use of a transthoracic antireflux procedure in patients with advanced gastroesophageal reflux disease.
