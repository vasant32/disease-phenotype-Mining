Barrett's esophagus is a chronic condition in which the normal squamous mucosal lining is replaced by columnar mucosa. Campylobacter-like organism (CLOs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and have been identified in Barrett's esophagus. The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of CLOs in Barrett's esophagus and to consider their role, if any, in the pathogenesis of the disease. None of the bacteria were identified in 38 specimens obtained from 34 patients with Barrett's esophagus. It is concluded that the incidence of CLOs in Barrett's esophagus must be low and that CLOs do not contribute to the natural history of the disease.
