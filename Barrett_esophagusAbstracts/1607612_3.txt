Twenty (2%) of 1,140 patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding had esophageal ulcers. Patients with esophageal ulcers most commonly had either melena (40%) or melena and hematemesis (40%). Fifty percent had orthostatic hypotension, and 80% required transfusions. Ulcers were associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use in 50%, hiatal hernia in 60%, and esophagitis in 40%. Endoscopic stigmata of recent hemorrhage consisted of oozing blood (35%) and adherent clot (25%). Six patients had multiple ulcers. The majority of ulcers (90%) were in the distal esophagus. Nine patients were endoscopically treated without complications except for rebleeding in 1 patient. Endoscopic therapy was associated with decreased duration of hospitalization. Overall mortality was 45% in these patients, but no deaths were related to bleeding. Although uncommon, esophageal ulcers are a cause of significant acute gastrointestinal bleeding that appears to respond to endoscopic treatment.
