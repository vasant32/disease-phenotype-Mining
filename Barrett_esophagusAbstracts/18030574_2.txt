We herein report a case of infiltrative esophageal signet-ring cell carcinoma resembling gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma. Grossly, the tumor was a diffusely infiltrative carcinoma involving the lower esophagus measuring 11 cm in diameter. The tumor extensively metastasized to the cervical, mediastinal, and abdominal lymph nodes, and the patient died of peritonitis and pleuritis carcinomatosa soon after undergoing a radical esophagectomy. Histologically, the tumor was signet-ring cell carcinoma covered with normal squamous epithelium. However, the most superficial part of the tumor center contained a region of Barrett's mucosa with incomplete-type intestinal metaplasia and a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma component with goblet cells. The expression of cytokeratins 7 and 20 also indicated that both the Barrett's mucosa and the signet-ring cell carcinoma had an esophageal origin. Esophageal signet-ring cell carcinoma with diffuse infiltrative growth is quite rare, and may need a special treatment strategy because of its highly aggressive behavior and poor treatment outcome.
