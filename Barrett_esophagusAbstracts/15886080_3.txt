AIMS: To obtain data on routine care of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease by French gastroenterologists. PATIENTS: Five thousand and forty-five adults with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: Patients were recruited by a representative sample of 598 French gastroenterologists. A full disease history, with treatments given/investigations undertaken, was obtained from all patients. The patients' expectations with regard to the improvement of the symptoms' control and the corresponding assessments made by the gastroenterologists were recorded on a 4-point scale. RESULTS: The mean time since diagnosis was approximately 4 years. The most commonly presented symptom was heartburn (79% of patients). A total of 3735 patients (74%) underwent endoscopy because of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Erosive oesophagitis was present in 38% and Barrett's oesophagus in 8%. Medical therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease was prescribed in 92% of patients, of whom 86% received proton pump inhibitors. Lifestyle advice was given to 73% of patients. Overall, 84% of patients and 72% of physicians expected 'highly' or 'moderately' improved control of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Gastroenterologists underrated the need for improvement of the symptoms' control as expressed by 'de novo' as well as 'previously diagnosed' patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides cross-sectional data on the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease by gastroenterologists in France. Most patients have high expectations of an improvement in their management, but gastroenterologists generally underrate these expectations.
