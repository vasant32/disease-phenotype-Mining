Three patients with a long-standing benign Barrett ulcer, resistant to treatment with high doses of either cimetidine or ranitidine, given for at least 3 months, were treated with 40 mg omeprazole daily for 9 wk. After 2 wk all symptoms had disappeared and at the end of treatment all three patients showed complete endoscopic ulcer healing. Patient compliance was excellent and no side effects were registered. We conclude that omeprazole is effective and safe in healing chronic resistant Barrett ulcers.
