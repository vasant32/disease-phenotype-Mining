 BACKGROUND: The role of fundoplication in the prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma is controversial. Development of cancer is associated with proliferation and anti-apoptosis, for which little data exist regarding their response to fundoplication. METHODS: Ki-67 and Bcl-2 expression was assessed in the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and the distal and proximal esophagus of 20 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) treated by fundoplication and in 7 controls. Endoscopy was performed preoperatively and 6 (20 patients) and 48 months (16 patients) postoperatively. RESULTS: There were positive correlations between Ki-67 and Bcl-2 levels in the EGJ (p > 0.001) and in the distal (p = 0.001) and proximal esophagus (p = 0.013). Compared to the preoperative level, Ki-67 expression was elevated in the distal (p = 0.012) and proximal (p = 0.007) esophagus at 48 months. In addition, compared to control values, Ki-67 expression was lower at the 6-month follow-up in the EGJ (p = 0.037) and the proximal esophagus (p = 0.003), and higher at the 48-month follow-up in the distal esophagus (p = 0.002). Compared to control values, Bcl-2 was lower at 6 months in the EGJ (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Proliferative activity after fundoplication increased in the long term in the distal esophagus despite a normal fundic wrap and healing of GERD.
