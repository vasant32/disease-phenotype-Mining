A patient with regional ileitis (Crohn's disease) developed a benign esophageal stricture. He had no history of heartburn or other symptoms of reflux esophagitis. The diagnosis of Crohn's disease was suspected but could not be proved preoperatively. The surgically resected esophagus showed the gross and microscopic features of Crohn's disease. Barrett's esophageal mucosa was also found in the resected esophagus. Postoperatively, the patient developed a fistula at the esophagogastrostomy site. Crohn's esophagitis has been reported in 15 patients but none had Barrett's esophagus. We believe our patient reported here is the first case with Crohn's disease and Barrett's esophagus.
