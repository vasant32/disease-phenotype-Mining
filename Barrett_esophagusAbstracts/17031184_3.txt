Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic disorder that affects millions of people worldwide and has the potential to lead to serious consequences, including cancer of the esophagus. It for this reason that there is such intense interest in the topic, this emphasized by the identification of some 341 articles published in the English language in the year 2000 alone. The present report highlights the results of a number of studies that either increase our understanding of the condition or raise important issues about its diagnosis and treatment. Included in the areas covered are (1) the role of genetics in GERD; (2) the mechanism for transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations and their association with hiatal hernias; (3) the role of Helicobacter pylori in GERD and Barrett esophagus; (4) efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors in GERD; and (5) the mechanism for chronic cough in patients with GERD, among others.
