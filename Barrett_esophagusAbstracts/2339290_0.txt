Two histological classifications of Barrett's esophagus are posited in the literature: (1) a layered disposition (Paull); (2) a mosaic pattern (Thompson). Only specialized epithelia are potentially neoplastic. Our experience, based on two histological studies, confirms the heterogeneity of Barrett's esophagus. These studies show that the mosaic pattern is more frequent than the layered disposition. Therefore we consider it extremely important to perform multiple biopsies (centimeter by centimeter on the four faces of the esophagus) to allow histological diagnosis of the specialized form of columnar epithelium and/or of dysplasia.
