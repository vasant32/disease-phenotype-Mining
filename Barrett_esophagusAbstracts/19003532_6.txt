 PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and progression of Barrett's epithelium and associated risk factors in Japan. METHODS: The study population comprised 869 cases. Endoscopic Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed based on the Prague C & M Criteria. The correlations of clinical factors with the prevalence and progression of endoscopic Barrett's epithelium were examined. RESULTS: Endoscopic Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed in 374 cases (43%), in the majority of which the diagnosis was short-segment Barrett's esophagus. The progression of Barrett's epithelium was identified in 47 cases. In univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses, aging, smoking habit, and erosive esophagitis were significantly associated with the prevalence of Barrett's epithelium, whereas aging and erosive esophagitis, especially severe erosive esophagitis, were significant contributing factors to the progression of Barrett's epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Forty-three percent of the total study population was diagnosed as having endoscopic Barrett's epithelium. During the follow-up period, 12.6% of the cases with Barrett's epithelium exhibited progression which was associated with aging and severe erosive esophagitis.
