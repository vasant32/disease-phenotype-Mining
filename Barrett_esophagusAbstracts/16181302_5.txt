 BACKGROUND: Barrett's oesophagus patients may continue to have abnormal oesophageal acid exposure on proton pump inhibitor therapy. The effect of factors such as Barrett's oesophagus length, hiatal hernia size and Helicobacter pylori infection on intra-oesophageal pH in Barrett's oesophagus patients has not been adequately studied. AIM: To evaluate oesophageal acid exposure in a large Barrett's oesophagus population on b.d. proton pump inhibitor therapy and determine clinical factors predicting normalization of intra-oesophageal pH on therapy. METHODS: Barrett's oesophagus patients were studied using 24 h pH monitoring to evaluate intra-oesophageal acid suppression on b.d. dosing of rabeprazole. RESULTS: Forty-six Barrett's oesophagus patients completed the study. Median total percentage time pH < 4 was 1.05% (range: 0-29.9%) in the entire group and respective values for upright and supine percentage time pH < 4 were 1.15% and 0%. However, 34 of the Barrett's oesophagus patients (73.9%) had a normal pH study (median total percentage time pH < 4: 0.2%) and 12 patients (26.1%) had an abnormal result (median total percentage time pH < 4: 9.3%). There were no significant differences between patients with a normal and abnormal 24 h pH result with respect to age, Barrett's oesophagus length, hiatal hernia size and presence of H. pylori infection. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 25% of Barrett's oesophagus patients continue to have abnormal total intra-oesophageal pH profiles despite b.d. proton pump inhibitor therapy. Factors such as age, Barrett's oesophagus length and hiatal hernia size cannot be used to predict persistent abnormal intra-oesophageal pH on proton pump inhibitor.
