A clinically valuable interpretation of esophageal biopsy specimens begins with well-prepared histologic sections. This may be especially true for reflux esophagitis and Barrett's glandular dysplasia. To determine exactly which histologic procedures are used by experts in gastrointestinal pathology, a checklist survey was mailed to 50 members of the Gastrointestinal Pathology Society. Responses were received from 42 (84%). Formalin, used 80% of the time, is overwhelmingly the most popular fixative. Orientation of biopsy material before further processing is performed in 36% of the institutions, most often (53%) by an endoscopy technician. The most frequently used (60%) substrate for orientation is filter material. The most common (83%) routine procedure uses only H&E staining. Others routinely add a mucin reaction to the H&E. Eleven different practices for sectioning are used; the most common (43%) is serial step sectioning at 3 levels. One third of the responders had a formal surveillance program for patients with Barrett's esophagus. For esophageal biopsy specimens, a broad spectrum of histologic practices exists. Trends for the more complex histotechnologic procedures to be used by those involved in screening for dysplastic Barrett's epithelium are evident.
