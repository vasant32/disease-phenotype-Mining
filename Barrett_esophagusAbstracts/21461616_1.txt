Capillary isoelectric focusing tends to suffer from poor reproducibility, particularly for the analysis of complex protein samples from cellular or tissue homogenates. This poor reproducibility appears to be associated with erratic variations in electroosmotic flow. One cause of electroosmotic flow variation is degradation of the capillary coating caused by the extremely basic solution commonly used during mobilization and focusing; this degradation of the capillary coating can be reduced by employing a CAPS mobilization buffer at pH 9. Another cause of variation is protein adsorption to the capillary wall, which causes an increase in electroosmotic flow. The effects of protein adsorption can be reduced by use of surfactants in the buffer and by employing an extremely low sample loading. We report the use of CAPS mobilization buffer in combination with an ultrasensitive laser-induced fluorescence detector for the reproducible analysis of âˆ¼2 ng of protein from a Barrett's esophagus biopsy.
