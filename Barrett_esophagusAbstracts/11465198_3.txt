A method for total esophageal reconstruction when intestinal options are no longer available is presented. The technique described utilizes the parascapular microsurgical free flap, which is tubed and interposed between the cervical esophagus and the gastric remnant in the abdomen. The technique involves a well-recognized microsurgical flap and may be added to the armamentarium for total esophageal reconstruction.
