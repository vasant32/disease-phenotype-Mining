BACKGROUND: Barrett's oesophagus is associated with an increased risk of the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic surveillance every 2-5 years has been recommended to prevent death from adenocarcinoma. AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of this strategy. METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of surveillance (as compared to no surveillance) was analysed with a computer model of a Markov process. RESULTS: Compared to no surveillance, the incremental cost-effectiveness of bi-annual endoscopy is 16,695 dollars per life-year saved. Surveillance is less cost-effective if the incidence rate of oesophageal adenocarcinoma is low and the 5-year survival rate is high. For surveillance to be cost-effective, there should be little reduction in health-related quality of life following surgical oesophagectomy to prevent death. Moreover, endoscopic surveillance and oesophagectomy need to be efficacious in reliably diagnosing high-grade dysplasia and preventing deaths from cancer. If such ideal conditions of surveillance are not met, the cost per life-year saved could rise five-fold. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic surveillance of patients with Barrett's oesophagus may be a cost-effective means to prevent death from oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
