Gastroesophageal reflux disease complicated by Barrett esophagus (BE) is a major risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). The mechanisms whereby acid reflux may accelerate the progression from BE to EA are not known. We found that NOX1 and NOX5-S were the major isoforms of NADPH oxidase in SEG1-EA cells. The expression of NOX5-S mRNA was significantly higher in these cells than in esophageal squamous epithelial cells. NOX5 mRNA was also significantly higher in Barrett tissues with high grade dysplasia than without dysplasia. Pulsed acid treatment significantly increased H(2)O(2) production in both SEG1-EA cells and BE mucosa, which was blocked by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. In SEG1 cells, acid treatment increased mRNA expression of NOX5-S, but not NOX1, and knockdown of NOX5 by NOX5 small interfering RNA abolished acid-induced H(2)O(2) production. In addition, acid treatment increased intracellular Ca(2+) and phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Acid-induced NOX5-S expression and H(2)O(2) production were significantly inhibited by removal of extracellular Ca(2+) and by knockdown of CREB using CREB small interfering RNA. Two novel CREB-binding elements TGACGAGA and TGACGCTG were identified in the NOX5-S gene promoter. Overexpression of CREB significantly increased NOX5-S promoter activity. Knockdown of NOX5 significantly decreased [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, which was restored by 10(-13) M H(2)O(2). Knockdown of NOX5 also significantly decreased retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and increased cell apoptosis and caspase-9 expression. In conclusion, in SEG1 EA cells NOX5-S is overexpressed and mediates acid-induced H(2)O(2) production. Acid-induced NOX5-S expression depends on an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) and activation of CREB. NOX5-S contributes to increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis.
