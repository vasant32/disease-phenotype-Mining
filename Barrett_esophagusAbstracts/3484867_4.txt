Early esophageal cancer (EEC) accounted for only seven (4.7%) of 148 cases of esophageal cancer diagnosed at the authors' hospital between 1977 and 1984. Two patients with EEC had squamous cell carcinoma and five had adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's mucosa. All seven patients had associated clinical findings, including low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding (three cases), odynophagia (one case), and chronic reflux symptoms due to underlying reflux esophagitis and Barrett esophagus (three cases). Since Barrett esophagus is a premalignant condition, the high proportion of adenocarcinomas in this series presumably reflects the more frequent radiologic evaluation of symptomatic patients with Barrett esophagus. On esophagography, four patients had 3-4.5-cm polypoid intraluminal masses that could not be distinguished radiographically from advanced esophageal carcinoma. In the other three patients, esophagrams revealed secondary achalasia, irregular flattening of the esophageal wall, and diffuse nodularity of the mucosa. The authors conclude that "early" esophageal cancers are not necessarily small cancers, since they may undergo considerable intraluminal or intramural growth and still be classified histologically as EEC. Radiologists should be aware of these findings, since EEC has an excellent prognosis with a 5-year survival approaching 90%.
