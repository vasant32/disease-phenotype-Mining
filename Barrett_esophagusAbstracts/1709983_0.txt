Oncologic screenings of the populations in the areas with increased incidence of esophageal cancer have revealed Barrett's ulcer in 1 percent of the examinees. Endoscopic and cytologic characteristics of this condition are presented. Precancer changes--severe dysplasia--are most frequent in male Kazakhs (14.1 percent) aged 50 to 59 (14.7 percent). Subjects with Barrett's ulcer developing severe dysplasia, as evidenced by cytograms, should be included in the group of subjects at risk for carcinoma of the lower third of the esophagus and cardia.
