 PURPOSE: Although the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is relatively low in Korean population, the number is increasing. The aim of this study is to analyze our experience with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From Sep. 2003 to Mar. 2008, 31 adult Korean patients diagnosed with GERD underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. A 360 degrees fundoplication was carried out in all patients. RESULTS: There were 19 males and 12 females with an average age of 46.8 +/- 17.0 years. Typical symptoms were present in 15 (48%) of patients, and atypical symptoms in 16 (51.6%). Both typical and atypical symptoms were present in 4 of patients (12.9%). Preoperative studies showed hiatal hernias in 13 patients (41.9%), Barrett's esophagus in 10 (32.3%), and reflux esophagitis in 18 (58.1%). Mean DeMeester score was 17.4 +/- 16.7, mean operative time 206.1 +/- 47.8 min and mean hospital stay 5.2 +/- 2.1 days. Perioperative complications occurred in 5 patients (16.1%), including gastric perforation, subcutaneous emphysema, atelectasis, and prolonged ileus. Gastroesophageal junction stenoses with subsequent endoscopic balloon dilations were required in 5 patients (16.1%). After surgery, symptoms were completely controlled in 17 patients (54.8%), partially improved in 12 patients (38.7%) and not controlled in 2 patients (6.5%). CONCLUSION: In our series, 93.5% of patients had either complete or partial remission of symptom after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Atypical symptoms were more predominant in our Korean patients. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is an efficacious method of controlling symptoms of GERD, even for those who have atypical symptoms.
