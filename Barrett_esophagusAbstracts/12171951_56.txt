 BACKGROUND: Although familial clusters of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma have been reported, a familial predisposition to these diseases has not been systematically investigated. AIMS: To determine whether Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal (or oesophagogastric junctional) adenocarcinoma aggregate in families. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A structured questionnaire eliciting details on reflux symptoms, exposure history, and family history was given to Caucasian case (n=58) subjects with Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma, and to Caucasian control (n=106) subjects with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease without Barrett's oesophagus. Reported diagnoses of family members were confirmed by review of medical records. RESULTS: The presence of a positive family history (that is, first or second degree relative with Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma) was significantly higher among case subjects compared with controls (24% v 5%; p<0.005). Case subjects were more likely to be older (p<0.001) and male (74% v 43% male; p<0.0005) compared with control subjects. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, family history was independently associated with the presence of Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (odds ratio 12.23, 95% confidence interval 3.34-44.76) after adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of obesity 10 or more years prior to study enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma are more likely to have a positive family history of Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma than individuals without Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or oesophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma. A positive family history should be considered when making decisions about screening endoscopy in patients with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux.
