Review of 18 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) revealed pathologic evidence of esophageal disease in six (33%). Four patients manifested varying degrees of esophagitis, ranging from mild to severe ulcerations and stricture formation. In two patients, symptomatic Barrett esophagus was detected 4 and 6 months after total gastrectomy, respectively. It is postulated that due to longstanding gastroesophageal reflux, Barrett esophagus was present in these two patients before total gastrectomy, and esophageal symptoms became only apparent after more compelling symptoms of gastric peptic ulceration were controlled by definitive surgery. Esophageal involvement occurs with greater frequency in patients with ZES; the previously held notion that esophageal disease due to gastroesophageal reflux in ZES patients is uncommon is contrary to the results of this study. It is recommended that all patients with ZES irrespective of symptom-complex should be routinely evaluated for the presence or absence of esophageal disease because of its important bearings on adequate surgical management.
