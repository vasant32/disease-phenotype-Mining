In 2010, a Korean guideline for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was made by the Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, in which the definition and diagnosis of GERD were not included. The aim of this guideline was to update the clinical approach to the diagnosis and management of GERD in adult patients. This guideline was developed by the adaptation process of the ADAPTE framework. Twelve guidelines were retrieved from initial queries through the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II process. Twenty-seven statements were made as a draft and revised by modified Delphi method. Finally, 24 consensus statements for the definition (n=4), diagnosis (n=7) and management (n=13) of GERD were developed. Multidisciplinary experts participated in the development of the guideline, and the external review of the guideline was conducted at the finalization phase.
