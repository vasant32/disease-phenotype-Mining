 BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is being developed as a potentially valuable method for high-resolution cross-sectional imaging of the esophageal mucosal and submucosal layers. One potential application of OCT imaging is to identify subsquamous Barrett's epithelium in patients who have undergone ablative therapy, which is not visible on standard endoscopic examination. However, histologic correlation confirming the ability of OCT to image subsquamous Barrett's epithelium has yet to be performed. DESIGN: Histologic correlation study. OBJECTIVE: To perform histologic correlation of ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence tomography (UHR-OCT) imaging for identification of subsquamous Barrett's epithelium. SETTING: Academic Medical Center (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). PATIENTS: Fourteen patients with pathologic biopsy specimens, proven to be high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma underwent esophagectomy. INTERVENTIONS: UHR-OCT imaging was performed on ex vivo esophagectomy specimens immediately after resection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Correlation of UHR-OCT images with histologic images. RESULTS: Subsquamous Barrett's epithelium was clearly identified by using UHR-OCT images and was confirmed by corresponding histology. LIMITATIONS: Difficulty distinguishing some subsquamous Barrett's glands from blood vessels in ex vivo tissue (because of the lack of blood flow) in some cases. Imaging was performed with a bench-top system. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study demonstrate that UHR-OCT imaging is capable of identifying subsquamous Barrett's epithelium.
