Epidemiologic data have shown that cholecystectomy is associated with a moderately increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The study objective was to evaluate the role of refluxed bile. A total of 696 patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms were included in the study, of whom 55 had a history of cholecystectomy (CHE). Bilirubin exposure was measured in percent time above absorbance 0.25 in the stomach and above 0.14 in the esophagus. Total gastric and esophageal bilirubin exposure was similar in both groups. Supine gastric bile reflux was slightly increased after cholecystectomy (30.6 +/- 30.2 vs. CHE: 37.1 +/- 29.5, P < 0.05). In patients with erosive esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus, there were differences in total gastric exposure (24.3 +/- 22.6 vs. CHE: 36.7 +/- 26.8, P < 0.05) but not in esophageal exposure. Cholecystectomy slightly augments bile reflux into the stomach without detectable differences in the esophagus. Therefore, increased esophageal bile reflux following cholecystectomy as a potential cause for the associated cancer risk could not be substantiated.
