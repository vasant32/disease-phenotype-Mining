In esophageal neoplasms, the histopathologic differentiation between Barrett's esophagus with or without intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma is often challenging. Immunohistochemistry might help to differentiate between these lesions. The expression of CDX2, LI-cadherin, mucin 2 (MUC2), blood group 8 (BG8, Lewis(y)), claudin-2, and villin was investigated in normal gastroesophageal (n = 23) and in Barrett's (n = 17) mucosa, in low-grade (n = 12) and high-grade (n = 9) intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN) as well as in esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 16), using immunohistochemistry. For CDX2 and LI-cadherin, the immunoreactivity score was highest in IEN while for MUC2, BG8, and villin, it dropped gradually from Barrett's via IEN to adenocarcinoma, and expression of Claudin-2 was only weak and focal in all lesions. The expression of MUC2 and LI-cadherin differed significantly between all examined lesions except between low-grade and high-grade IEN. MUC2 and LI-cadherin are useful immunohistochemical markers for the differentiation between normal glandular mucosa, Barrett's mucosa, IEN, and invasive carcinoma of the esophagus; however, none of the examined markers was helpful for the differentiation between low-grade and high-grade IEN.
