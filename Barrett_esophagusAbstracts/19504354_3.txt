 BACKGROUND AND AIM: The endoscopic landmark of esophagogastric junction (EGJ) for diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus (BE) differs between Japan and Western countries. Japanese endoscopists use the distal end of the lower esophageal palisade vessels to localize EGJ. In the West, endoscopists use the proximal gastric folds because of concerns that palisade vessels may be difficult to recognize. We evaluated whether there were differences between American and Japanese endoscopists in the recognition of palisade vessels. METHOD: A total of 82 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were referred for diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoendoscopy (EGD) at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, from May to July 2008. American and Japanese endoscopists evaluated the EGJ of patients undergoing diagnostic EGD. We analyzed the differences in the recognition of the distal end of palisade vessels. We calculated the kappa statistic to measure interobserver variability. RESULTS: Based on localization using the distal end of the palisade vessels, American and Japanese endoscopists identified the EGJ in 87.8% (72/82) and 89.0% (73/82) of cases, respectively. The kappa statistic for visualization of EGJ was 0.88 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73-1.00]. CONCLUSION: American and Japanese endoscopists similarly recognized the distal end of palisade vessels as EGJ.
