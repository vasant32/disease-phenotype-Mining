 BACKGROUND: Barrett esophagus (BE) caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease can lead to esophageal cancer. The success of endoscopic treatments with BE eradication depends on esophageal anatomy and post-treatment acid exposure. STUDY DESIGN: Between January 2008 and December 2009, 10 patients were selected for combination treatment of BE using laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery and endoscopic radiofrequency ablation. Retrospective review of preoperative, procedural, and postoperative data was performed. RESULTS: Seven study patients had a pathologic diagnosis of nondysplastic BE and 3 patients had a diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia. Average length of BE lesions was 6.4 ± 4.8 cm. Procedure time averaged 154.4 ± 46.4 minutes. At the time of surgery, the mean number of ablations performed was 4.39 ± 1.99. Six patients were noted to have major hiatal hernias requiring reduction. Five patients (80%) had 100% resolution of their BE at their first postoperative endoscopy. The remaining 3 patients had a ≥50% resolution and underwent subsequent endoscopic ablation. Symptomatic results revealed that 4 patients had substantial dysphagia to solids and other symptoms were minimal. Two patients were noted to have complications related to the ablative treatments. One stricture and 1 perforation were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation of BE at the time of laparoscopic fundoplication is feasible and can effectively treat BE lesions. A single combined treatment can result in fewer overall procedures performed to obtain BE eradication.
