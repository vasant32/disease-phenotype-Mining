 BACKGROUND: The effect of the composition of reflux bile acids, especially the ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic ones, on the development of Barrett's oesophagus has not been fully investigated in human studies. AIMS: To evaluate the influence of the bile acid composition of gastric juice on Barrett's oesophagus, a prospective study was designed. METHODS: Fifty patients with and 100 patients without Barrett's oesophagus were enrolled. For all enrolled patients, gastric juice was collected by the endoscopic procedure for bile acid analysis. The ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic bile acids (bile hydrophobicity ratio, BHR) was calculated from 6 kinds of bile acids analysed in gastric juice. The relationship between the ratio and clinico-pathological factors of Barrett's oesophagus was investigated. RESULTS: The mean of BHR of patients with Barrett's oesophagus was significantly higher than that of patients without Barrett's oesophagus (0.26 ± 0.05 vs. 0.08 ± 0.02, p<0.05). In multivariate analysis, a high BHR value was a predictor for the presence of Barrett's oesophagus (OR 5.74, p<0.001). In patients with Barrett's oesophagus, the BHR correlated with COX-2 protein expression and with accelerated cellular proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Barrett's oesophagus had a higher BHR in the gastric juice than those without.
