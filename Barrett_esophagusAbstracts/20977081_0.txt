This paper aims at evaluating the role of improper nutrition in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's oesophagus (BE), and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC). It also tries to examine the influence of the alcohol, nicotine and coffee consumption in the development of the mentioned diseases. There were 180 subjects included in the trial, 109 males and 71 females, which were divided in the four groups (70 patients with GERD, 20 patients with BE, 20 patients with EADC, and 70 healthy examinees composing a control group). Their dietary habits were investigated by the usage of the dietary questionnaires. The results show that the fast eating and the insufficient mastication were present in 64.3-85.0% patients with GERD, BE, and EADC in comparison with only 15% of the examinees from the control group. Furthermore, very hot was preferred by 25.0-42.9% of the mentioned patients in comparison with only 12.9% from the control group. Similarly, 60.0-75.0% of them preferred strongly spiced food on contrary with 17.1% of the healthy examinees. Moreover, strong alcoholic beverages were consumed three or more times per week by 55.0-75.0% of the mentioned patients in comparison with only 15.7% from the control group. Finally, there were 15.7-55.0% heavy smokers among the patients with GERD, BE, and EADC contrary to 1.4% in the control group.
