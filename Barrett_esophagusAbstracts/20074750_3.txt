 OBJECTIVE: Radiofrequency ablation for Barrett's esophagus in combination with an antireflux procedure has not been widely documented. We report our initial experience with radiofrequency ablation in association with antireflux procedure for Barrett's metaplasia and low-grade dysplasia. METHODS: A total of 14 patients (10 male and 4 female patients) presented with Barrett's metaplasia (n=11) or low-grade dysplasia (n=3). Median age was 60 years (38-80 years). The severity of Barrett's esophagus was classified by length (in centimeters), appearance (circumferential/noncircumferential), and histology (1, normal; 2, Barrett's metaplasia; and 3, low-grade dysplasia). Radiofrequency ablation was performed with the HALO 360 degrees or 90 degrees systems (BARRX Medical, Sunnyvale, Calif). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 17 months. The mean number of ablative procedures undertaken was 2.6 (range, 1-6). There was no mortality, but there were 2 perioperative complications after the antireflux procedure (pneumonia, 1; atrial fibrillation, 1). One patient had mild dysphagia requiring a single dilation 2 months after ablation. The mean length of Barrett's esophagus decreased from 6.2 to 1.2 cm after treatment (P=.001). Barrett's grade decreased significantly (P=.003). Before therapy, circumferential Barrett's esophagus was present in 13 patients. At last endoscopy, only 1 patient had circumferential Barrett's esophagus present. The number of radiofrequency ablation treatments was significantly (P < .05) associated with success. All patients receiving 3 or more treatments had complete resolution of Barrett's metaplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation performed either before or after an antireflux procedure is safe. This approach is effective for reducing or eliminating metaplasia and dysplasia. Long-term studies will be necessary to determine whether this approach can provide durable control of both reflux and Barrett's esophagus.
