This article summarises the conference which took place during the " Centre Universitaire de Médecine Générale de l'Université Libre de Bruxelles" (C.U.M.G.-U.L.B.) Seminar in April 7-14, 2007. It is in no way an extensive review about gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but instead an attempt of answering the most frequently asked questions by the general practitioner, reported in 9 pictures: 1. Definition, prevalence and physiopathology. 2. Work up and role of endoscopy. 3. Medical treatment. 4. PPI: Equivalence of the medications? Equivalence of the generic drugs? 5. Barrett's esophagus. 6. Reflux and negative endoscopy. 7. Extra-oesophageal manifestations. 8. Surgical treatments. 9. Endoscopic treatments.
