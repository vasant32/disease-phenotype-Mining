Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed prospectively in 38 patients with various esophageal disorders. Twenty-four had a histologically proven carcinoma and EUS was done to assess its ability in preoperative staging. In 9 of 24 patients (37.5%), tumor stenosis could be passed with the endoscope and EUS preoperative findings regarding tumor extension and the presence of enlarged periesophageal lymph nodes were confirmed in those operated on (n = 4). In five patients with achalasia, a periesophageal tumor was reliably excluded by EUS. In one of four patients with Barrett's esophagus, EUS demonstrated a small (less than 1 cm) carcinoma that could not be visualized with any conventional technique. For differentiation of cancer recurrence after operation from periesophageal scar tissue EUS-guided transmural biopsies are needed. Our experience shows that at the present time EUS is the most reliable method to demonstrate small (less than or equal to 1 cm) intra- and extramural esophageal lesions and that it should therefore be applied early in the work-up of patients with dysphagia.
