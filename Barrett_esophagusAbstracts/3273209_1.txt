Sixty-two cases of Barrett's esophagus were observed among 707 patients with hiatal hernia (8.7%). The symptomatology of this condition is described. An additional 10 adenocarcinomas were associated with a Barrett's esophagus--a carcinoma prevalence of 13.8%. Differences in pathology and clinical manifestations of nonmalignant and malignant cases were determined. Fifty-one patients with nonmalignant Barrett's esophagus were operated upon conservatively, while 11 underwent resection. Our results favor conservative surgery via an abdominal approach. The patients with adenocarcinomas underwent esophageal resection with six apparent cures from 6 months to 5 years. Histological study showed specialized epithelium in 8 of 10 cases and severe dysplasia in 5. Our clinical study of Barrett's esophagus shows an incidence of malignancy equal to 1 new case per 274 patient-years (1.72%). It is still not firmly established whether correction of reflux will influence the level of columnar epithelium in the esophagus, esophageal dysplasia, and the risk of malignancy.
