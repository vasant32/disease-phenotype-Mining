The purpose of the investigation was to study a role of tight junction (TJ) claudins (CL) in the morphogenesis of adenocarcinoma (AC) in the presence of Barrett's esophagus (BE). The investigation was performed on the specimens obtained from patients, including 41 males and 29 females, aged 16 to 81 years, with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) at endoscopic biopsies and surgery. An immunohistological study was carried out using monoclonal antibodies to Cl 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 ("Zymed"). The location of a reaction product was defined in the epithelial membranes and cytoplasm (diffuse staining). The patients were divided into 6 groups: 1) GERD-esophagitis (a control group, n = 10); 2) GERD-esophagitis with gastric metaplasia (n = 15); 3) BE with enteric metaplasia (EM) without dysplasia (n = 9); 4) BE with colonic metaplasia (CM) without dysplasia (n = 9); 5) BE with varying dysplasia (the latter being detected in the presence of CM (n = 10); 6) AC in the presence of BE (n = 7). Transition of low- to high-grade dysplasia and to AC into BE was established to be accompanied by TJ loss, as appeared as disappearance of apical staining of Cl 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7; moreover, their cytoplasmic staining increased in parallel. The lost capacity of accumulating Cl in the area of TJ in AC to BE led to the elimination of BE and promoted tumor progression (proliferation, invasion, and metastatic spread). The markers of cell differentiation of Cl 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 may be recommended for determination of the malignant potential of dysplasia to BE.
