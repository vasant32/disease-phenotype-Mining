Distal esophageal resection and jejunum interposition for early Barrett carcinoma. Limited resection with regional lymphadenectomy and jejunal interposition is safe, prevents gastroesophageal reflux and is associated with good quality of life. The procedure represents an oncologically adequate and thus attractive limited surgical alternative to radical esophagectomy or endoscopic resection and ablation techniques in patients with high grade dysplasia or T1 adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus.
