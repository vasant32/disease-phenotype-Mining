 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and clinical and endoscopic characteristics of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and the relationship between BE and reflux esophagitis (RE). METHODS: Patients with BE were diagnosed according to new standard by endoscopy and histology. The prevalence, form in endoscopy, histology of biopsy, age, sex, symptom, Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and relationship between BE and RE were analyzed. RESULTS: BE was 7.90% of the total endoscopy number, and male vs female was 1.98, mean age (45.1 +/- 14.8) years old. Only 19.15% of BE patients had typical reflux symptoms. 81.20% of BE patients were with short segment BE. Intestinal metaplasia was detected in 34.83% of BE and dysplasia 9.88%. 39.94% of BE patients were infected with Hp. Patients with RE (2.07%) were significantly less than those of BE (P < 0.01). 8.42% of BE patients were also with RE and 32.11% of RE patients were also with BE. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of BE in Fujian of China is high. Most of BE are short segment BE and male and have no typical reflux symptoms. Intestinal metaplasia is found in 1/3 of BE patients. There isn't a close association between BE and RE.
