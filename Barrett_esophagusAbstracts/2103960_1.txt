Specimens from twelve patients with Barrett's esophagus and four additional cases of esophageal carcinoma who had Barrett's epithelium were histologically and by mucin histochemistry examined. Specialized epithelium was observed in 10/12 non cancerous patients. In 9 of these either gastric-fundic or junctional epithelium were seen. All patients with carcinoma had evidence of specialized epithelium. Sulphated mucins were preponderant in biopsies from 7 of the 9 patients with dysplasia either alone or associated with carcinoma. In all 5 specimens with specialized epithelium but without dysplasia or carcinoma, sialomucins were predominant.
