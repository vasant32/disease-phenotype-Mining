OBJECTIVE: In Barrett's adenocarcinomas, in contrast to squamous oesophageal carcinomas, K-ras point mutations are thought to be a frequent event. The frequency of K-ras point mutations in premalignant forms of Barrett's oesophagus (metaplasia, dysplasia) leading to adenocarcinoma with increased risk is currently not known. To establish the frequency of K-ras mutations in premalignant forms of Barrett's oesophagus, we investigated oesophageal biopsy specimens with Barrett's metaplastic and dysplastic epithelium for point mutations in the K-ras gene/codons 12, 13. DESIGN: A total of 412 biopsies from patients with Barrett's oesophagus were histologically classified into biopsies with metaplasia (n = 252), dysplasia (n = 105) and adenocarcinoma (n = 11), as well as biopsies distant from disease (normal, n = 37 and hyperplastic squamous epithelium, n = 7). METHODS: DNA from biopsy specimens was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a modified primer for generating a restriction site in the case of wild type in codon 12. Wild-type or point mutations in the K-ras gene/codons 12, 13 were detected by restriction fragment length analysis of the PCR products. RESULTS: Point mutations in K-ras/codon 12 were found in 9 biopsies (n = 1 in metaplasia, n = 4 in dysplasias, n = 4 in adenocarcinomas). All the other biopsies showed the wild type of K-ras/codon 12. No K-ras/codon 13 mutation (GGCgly-->GACasp) was observed. CONCLUSION: Mutations in K-ras/codon 12 were rarely found in premalignant forms of Barrett's oesophagus. Whereas the screening for K-ras point mutations in metaplastic sites of Barrett's epithelium seems not to be of practical value, the screening for mutations in dysplastic lesions might be helpful to estimate the individual risk for progression of Barrett's epithelium to adenocarcinoma. A further evaluation in larger numbers of patients is needed.
