The prognosis of patients with oesophageal cancer is poor, with an overall 5-year survival rate below 15%. The best chance for cure of patients with oesophageal cancer is surgical resection. However, more than 50% of patients have inoperable disease and can only be palliated for dysphagia. Some of these patients participate in studies investigating the activity of single-agent or combination chemotherapy. We report a patient who was cured of metastatic adenocarcinoma in Barrett's oesophagus by six courses of ifosfamide, a chemotherapeutic agent with little or no activity in other patients with adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction. After a follow-up of 13 years and 7 months, no evidence of tumour recurrence was found, while biopsies from the Barrett's oesophagus revealed only low-grade dysplasia. This case obviously raises the question as to how patients with inoperable oesophageal carcinoma can sometimes be cured by chemotherapy alone.
