Geoprevalence and chronoprevalence of reflux esophagitis were studied from a literature survey, which showed that the prevalence of reflux esophagitis seems to be correlated with economical development. In East Asia, prevalence of reflux esophagitis is between that of Western Europe and Africa. The prevalence of columnar-lined esophagus (CLE) was surveyed in East Asia and in Sendai, with reference to Helicobacter pylori infection. Prevalence of CLE was 0.9% in East Asia and 1.2% in Sendai, and H. pylori infection was 4% and 20%, respectively. Patient mean age was 63 years, and 73% were male. Endoscopic severity of esophagitis was mild. Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus has increased in Japan in the past 25 years, but the ratio to squamous cell carcinoma is low and no significant changes have been identified. Further observation is required because the prevalence of reflux esophagitis is increasing in Japan and East Asia.
