Neoplastic progression in Barrett's esophagus (BE) occurs by a multistep process associated with early molecular and morphological changes. This study evaluated cell proliferation and p53 expression and their correlation in the development and progression of esophageal adenocarcinoma. PCNA and p53 expressions were analyzed in biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry including patients with reflux esophagitis, BE, BE with concomitant esophagitis, Barrett's dysplasia, esophageal adenocarcinoma and a control group without any histological changes. Progressive increase in cell proliferation and p53 expression was found in the sequence of malignant transformation of the esophageal mucosa. While cell proliferation was significantly lower in the control group compared with all other groups, there was no increase in p53 expression of esophageal tissues that were negative for dysplasia. Dysplastic BE tissues revealed significantly higher cell proliferation and p53 expression levels compared to BE, reflux esophagitis or BE with concomitant esophagitis. Both, cell proliferation and p53 expression were significantly higher in adenocarcinoma compared to BE or Barrett's dysplasia. Interestingly, while just BE with concomitant esophagitis showed significantly higher p53 expression levels than BE, both, BE with concomitant esophagitis and reflux esophagitis revealed significantly higher cell proliferation levels compared to BE. Alterations of cell proliferation and p53 expression showed a strong correlation. Simultaneous activation of cell proliferation and p53 expression strongly suggest their association with esophageal epithelial tumor genesis and particularly, their specific role in the biology of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Quantification of these parameters in BE is thought to be useful to identify patients at higher risk for progression to adenocarcinoma.
