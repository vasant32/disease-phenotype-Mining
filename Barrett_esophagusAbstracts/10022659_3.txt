Most esophageal malignancies are either squamous carcinomas or adenocarcinomas arising in the background of Barrett's esophagus. We describe a case of an 85-yr-old woman in whom the diagnosis of esophageal malignancy was difficult to confirm despite its endoscopic appearance and previous biopsies. This case illustrates the difficulty in diagnosing Hodgkin's disease of the esophagus. Despite the rarity of this entity, if clinically indicated by symptoms, large, deep biopsies by rigid esophagoscopy should be considered.
