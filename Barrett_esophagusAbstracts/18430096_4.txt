For many patients after subtotal esophagectomy and gastric pull-up, reflux of gastric contents to the esophageal stump is the leading clinical problem. Besides symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation, de novo formation of columnar mucosa in the esophageal remnant is a well-known and frequent phenomenon. In this context, the remnant supra-anastomotic esophagus serves as an in vivo model for the study of Barrett's carcinogenesis. We present a retrospective case analysis of a patient who developed de novo Barrett's metaplasia followed by de novo invasive carcinoma 28 months after gastric pull-up by assessing clinical and molecular parameters.
