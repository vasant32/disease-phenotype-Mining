 HYPOTHESIS: Symptom control does not reflect elimination of abnormal acid reflux or abnormal bile reflux in patients with long-segment Barrett esophagus receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). DESIGN: Prospective survey. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-two patients with long-segment Barrett esophagus who were asymptomatic with PPIs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory pH and bile reflux monitoring while continuing PPIs. RESULTS: Abnormal acid reflux (pH <4 for 11.9% [interquartile range, 6.8%-19.6%) of 24 hours] persisted in 15 patients (47%) who could not be distinguished from those with normal acid reflux (pH <4 for <4.5% of 24 hours) by any endoscopic, manometric, or therapeutic characteristic. Abnormal bile reflux (absorbance >0.14 for 8.7% [interquartile range, 3.9%-8.7%] of 24 hours) was detected in 11 (48%) of 23 patients, such that both normal bile reflux (absorbance >0.14 for <1.8% of 24 hours) and normal acid reflux were observed in only 8 patients (35%). There was no association between abnormal acid reflux and abnormal bile reflux. CONCLUSIONS: Despite symptom control with PPIs, both acid reflux and bile reflux were controlled in only one third of patients. Posttherapeutic monitoring of acid and bile reflux is recommended in future clinical trials of PPI treatment vs laparoscopic antireflux surgery.
