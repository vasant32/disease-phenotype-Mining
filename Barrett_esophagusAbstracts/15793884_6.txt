 AIM: This prospective study evaluated the effectiveness of 90 W argon plasma coagulation (APC) for the ablation of Barrett's esophagus (BE) that is considered to be the main risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The results from 25 patients, observed at the First Department of General Surgery, University of Verona, Italy, from October 2000 to October 2003, who underwent APC for histologically proven BE were prospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The ablation treatment was completed in all the patients but one (96%). The mean number of APC sessions needed to complete ablation was 1.6 (total number: 40). The eradication was obtained in the majority of cases by one session only (60%), two sessions were required in 24% of the cases and three or more in 16%. About 43% of the sessions were complicated. Retrosternal pain (22.5%) and fever (17.5%) were the most frequent symptoms. Only one major complication occurred, it was an hemorrhage due to ulcer formation on the treated esophagus that required urgent endoscopic sclerosis and admission. The follow-up was accomplished in all the patients with a mean period of 26.3 mo and 20 patients (84%) with a follow-up period longer than 24 mo. Only one patient showed a relapse of metaplastic mucosa 12 mo after the completion of ablation. The patient was hence re-treated and now is free from recurrence 33 mo later. CONCLUSION: High power setting (90 W) APC showed to be safe and effective. The effects persist at a mean follow-up period of two years with a comparable cost in term of complications with respect to standard power settings. Further studies with greater number of patients are required to confirm these results and to assess if ablation reduces the incidence of malignant progression.
