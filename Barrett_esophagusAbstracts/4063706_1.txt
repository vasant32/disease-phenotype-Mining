This article reviews our experience with 19 cases of Barrett oesophagus. Radiological findings included hiatus hernia, gastro-oesophageal reflux, strictures and oesophagitis. The strictures were most commonly distal. The recently described lace-like reticular pattern of the mucosa was noted in one case of the 15 who had air-contrast views. It was associated with an adjacent stricture. The low incidence of this radiological finding emphasises that Barrett oesophagus is a histological diagnosis. Six patients had only the non-specific and common radiological findings of reflux with or without hiatus hernia and one patient had a normal examination. These seven cases demonstrate the lack of suggestive radiological findings in some patients.
