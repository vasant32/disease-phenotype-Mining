Argon plasma coagulation (APC) has been used to ablate Barrett's esophagus, however, its role in the management of non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus is uncertain. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) for ablation of Barrett's esophagus in a prospective randomized controlled trial in two university teaching hospitals. Fifty-seven patients using proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication and with Barrett's esophagus were randomized to undergo either ablation using endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) or ongoing surveillance. Fifty-one patients underwent endoscopy at 12 months. Endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) versus surveillance endoscopy was studied. Endoscopy and histopathological appearances of Barrett's esophagus at 12 months follow-up was also studied. Initially, at least 95% ablation of the metaplastic mucosa was achieved in 25 of the 26 treated patients. At 12 months, 14 of 23 APC patients had at least 95% regression, and nine of 23 had complete regression of Barrett's esophagus. No surveillance patient had more than 95% regression. The length of Barrett's esophagus shortened significantly after APC (mean 3.0 vs. 0.5 cm). Significant regression of Barrett's esophagus follows ablation with APC, although complete regression was achieved in less than half. The role of APC ablation of non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus remains uncertain.
