Adenocarcinoma arising from short-segment Barrett's esophagus (SSBE) is rare in Japan, although the incidence of this condition is increasing in Western countries. Four cases of early adenocarcinoma arising from SSBE were diagnosed and treated at Niigata-prefectural Yoshida Hospital. All patients were male, variously 55, 71, 73 and 79 years of age. All four patients had long-term gastroesophageal reflux disease, although one patient had erosive esophagitis and three patients did not have erosive esophagitis. Three patients were diagnosed as having Helicobacter pylori-free stomach. All adenocarcinomas occurred close to the squamocolumnar junction. Patients with SSBE should undergo detailed endoscopic examination of the squamocolumnar junction in order to detect early adenocarcinoma arising from SSBE.
