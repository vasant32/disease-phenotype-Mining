The relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and reflux-induced esophageal diseased is controversial. We examined esophageal disease severity in patients with columnar-lined esophagus and compared results between patients with and without Helicobacter pylori infection. Medical records of 1000 patients diagnosed with columnar-lined esophagus were examined. Endoscopic and histological findings of reflux-induced esophageal disease were compared between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative patients. Four hundred twenty-nine patients (42.9%) showed evidence of H. pylori status, of whom 239 (55.7%) were positive and 190 (44.3%) negative. There were no significant differences in length of columnar-lined segment (P = 0.305), frequency of associated esophagitis (P = 0.583), or presence of gastroduodenal inflammation (P = 0.335, P = 0.131) between the two groups. Histological grade of esophageal disease severity was similar between them, with no statistically significant differences (P = 0.231). We conclude that in patients with established columnar-lined esophagus, there appears to be no difference in severity of reflux-induced esophageal disease between those with and those without H. pylori infection.
