Esophagopericardial fistula is a rare complication of numerous benign, malignant, and traumatic conditions of the esophagus. Approximately 100 cases of fistulae between the esophagus and heart have been reported. We describe the second reported case of an esophagopericardial fistula secondary to a benign esophageal ulcer within Barrett's mucosa without prior surgery. The radiologic, endoscopic, and surgical management of this case are discussed.
