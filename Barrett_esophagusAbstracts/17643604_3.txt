 BACKGROUND: Currently, endoscopic biopsy is the only method used to diagnose esophageal adenocarcinoma. Using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) ProteinChip technology, we sought to identify a potentially diagnostic serum protein pattern that can serve as a reliable blood test for the diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma. In addition, we sought to identify potential biomarkers for esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Whole serum was collected using standard techniques from subjects with a known diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma as well as from subjects without any known esophageal disease. The samples were spotted onto a hydrophobic (H50) and immobilized metal affinity (IMAC30) chip surface and allowed to incubate. All samples were run in duplicate. After several washes, matrix was added and a mass range of 1500 to 30000 daltons was analyzed by SELDI-Time-of-Flight mass spectroscopy. Statistical analysis was performed using Biomarker Pattern Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). RESULTS: For the H50 analysis, 3 peaks were identified that correctly diagnosed 42 of 43 cancers and 10 of 11 normals. For the IMAC30, 4 peaks were identified that correctly diagnosed 50 of 50 cancers and 10 of 10 normals. CONCLUSIONS: Serum proteomic pattern shows great promise in the diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma. This technology may lead to the development of a noninvasive screening test as well as to the identification of potential novel biomarkers for esophageal adenocarcinoma.
