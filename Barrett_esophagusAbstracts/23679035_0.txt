Survival rates in esophageal atresia (EA) patients have reached 90%. In long-term follow-up studies the focus has shifted from purely surgical or gastrointestinal evaluation to a multidisciplinary approach. We evaluated the long-term morbidity in adolescent and adult EA patients and discussed mainly nonsurgical issues. Dysphagia is common and reported in up to 85% of patients. In young adults gastroesophageal reflux disease occurs frequently with development of Barrett esophagus in 6% reported in different series. It is difficult to estimate respiratory morbidity from the literature because many different definitions, questionnaires, and study designs have been used. However, many patients seem to suffer from respiratory problems even into adulthood. In conclusion, morbidity is not only restricted to surgical problems but many different domains are involved. These are all related and together determine to a large extent the quality of life of EA patients and also of their families. We assume that a multidisciplinary care approach seems best to address their special needs.
