Ten years' experience with pertechnetate (Tc-99m) abdominal scintigraphy has shown that the method is specifically indicated for the diagnosis and location of ectopic gastric mucosa in a Meckel's diverticulum, in enteric or gastric duplications and cysts, and in Barrett's esophagus. Careful patient preparation is essential, and sequential gamma camera imaging for 1 hr in the anterior projection is advisable, with complementary lateral, upright, and postvoiding views. Nonspecific accumulations of the tracer within tumours, intestinal obstructions, arteriovenous malformations, and the urinary tract can be recognized with the help of the clinical history and can be investigated by other tests. This approach has raised the accuracy of the method above 90%.
