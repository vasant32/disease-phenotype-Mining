BACKGROUND: Management of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's oesophagus is controversial: surgery carries an appreciable morbidity/mortality, high-grade dysplasia may not progress to cancer and endoscopic ablation is an emerging option. AIM: To review Barrett's oesophagus-related high-grade dysplasia management and outcome over a 10-year period. METHODS: This was a retrospective case note review of 36 patients identified from a pathology database. RESULTS: There were 31 men of mean age 67 years. Endoscopic surveillance identified nine. Median follow-up was 21 months. Seven patients had no further intervention because of age/comorbidity. The other 29 had repeat endoscopic biopsies, nine showing cancer (six oesophagectomized). Of the 20 remaining patients with persisting high-grade dysplasia, eight had surgery (histology showed cancer in six), seven continued endoscopic surveillance (high-grade dysplasia regressed in four) and five had 'curative' argon ablation. An intensive biopsy protocol was not followed in 55% of endoscopies. Prevalent cancers occurred in 44% with an annual incidence of 5% over 5 years. All cause mortality was 39% (14 of 36, eight of 14 from cancer). CONCLUSIONS: Management of high-grade dysplasia was not uniform. Unsuspected cancer was common in high-grade dysplasia patients undergoing surgery but 13% regressed under surveillance. High-grade dysplasia patients have a high mortality but 43% did not die from cancer.
