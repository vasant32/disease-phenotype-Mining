The neuroendocrine tumours of the oesophagus are exceptional. They are a spectrum of heterogeneous tumours often not clearly defined in the literature. We report a case of moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumour of the oesophagus arising from Barrett's mucosa in 51-year-old man treated surgically and who was free of disease 28 months after excision. We discuss about this case, the classification, the histogenesis and therapeutic approaches of these tumours.
