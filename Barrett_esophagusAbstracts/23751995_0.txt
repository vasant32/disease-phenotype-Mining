 INTRODUCTION: : Barrett esophagus (BE) is a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease. We wish to determine the effects of surgery on the histology of the esophageal mucosa and evaluate Quality of Life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : Twenty-seven patients with columnar-lined esophagus (CLE) metaplasia underwent laparoscopic Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication. Patients were submitted to close follow-up. RESULTS: : One patient voluntarily left follow-up after surgery. CLE was still present in 18 patients (66.6%); no patient developed dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma. Two patients with gastric metaplasia and 1 patient with intestinal metaplasia had regression at 12 and 24 months after surgery (11.1%). DeMeester and Johnson score decreased from 38.69 (SD±51.44) to 11.99 (SD±18.08) at 6 months, 12.69 (SD±12.91) at 12 months, and it was 11.38 (SD±6.43) at 24 months. Preoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease-health related quality of life was 19.90 (SD±18.54), 9.80 (SD±8.77) at 6 months, 9.57 (SD±9.14) at 12 months, and 11.53 (SD±6.48) at 24 months. Short form-36 measurement showed significant improvement. CONCLUSIONS: : Management of CLE requires multidisciplinary approach. Medical therapy does not prevent biliary reflux into the esophagus. Surgical therapy is effective and long lasting. It should be performed by experienced surgical teams.
