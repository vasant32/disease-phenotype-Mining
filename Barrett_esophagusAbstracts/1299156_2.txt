Ten patients with documented scleroderma were assessed before and after antireflux operations over a twelve year period. The approach was through the left chest in 9 of 10 patients (7 short Nissen, 1 Collis Nissen, 1 Collis Belsey) and through the abdomen for 1 (vagotomy, antrectomy and Roux en Y). Clinically, 5 of 10 patients still mention episodes of heartburn. Dysphagia, which was present in 8 patients before the operation, has been replaced by a slow emptying impression in five. Endoscopically five patients had a columnar lined esophageal mucosa. Four more were considered to have ulcerative esophagitis and stricture which proved to be also Barrett's esophagus in the postoperative assessment. Three patients had preoperative 24 h pH assessment when the technique became available. Their postoperative control studies revealed persistent acid exposure but to a lesser degree. All ten patients had 24 h pH studies in their postoperative assessment and 5 out of 10 still show abnormal exposure to acid. Esophageal motility studies did not reveal significant changes to the hypomotility of the distal esophageal body and to the decreased tone of the Lower Esophageal Sphincter area. Both radiologically and using esophageal transit scintigrams the esophagus shows atony and poor emptying before the operation. Retention is increased following the creation of an antireflux technique at the esophagogastric junction. The success rate of antireflux operations in scleroderma patients is limited. The ideal procedure to use in this condition remains unclear.
