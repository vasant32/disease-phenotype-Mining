BACKGROUND & AIMS: Barrett's esophagus, which is linked to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, is associated with reflux of bile. Duodenogastric reflux is increased after cholecystectomy. This study aims to evaluate if cholecystectomy is associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. METHODS: A population-based cohort study of cholecystectomized patients in Sweden between 1965 and 1997 cross-linked with the Swedish Cancer Register. RESULTS: Cholecystectomized patients had an increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.8). Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma was not found to be associated with cholecystectomy (SIR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7-1.1). Patients with gallstone disease on whom surgery was not performed did not have an increased risk of adenocarcinoma or squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus. CONCLUSIONS: Cholecystectomy is associated with a moderately increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, possibly by the toxic effect of refluxed duodenal juice on the esophageal mucosa. Further studies are needed regarding the link between bile reflux and esophageal carcinogenesis.
