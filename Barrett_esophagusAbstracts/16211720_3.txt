Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma, although increasingly common, have no known genetic cause. In this report we describe a family with a remarkable history of Barrett's oesophagus and adenocarcinoma. The index case is a 76-year-old man with adenocarcinoma arising within Barrett's oesophagus. Two of his three brothers, aged 68 and 78 years, also developed adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's oesophagus and the remaining 67-year-old brother has severe dysplasia in biopsies from Barrett's oesophagus. The sons and daughters of the index case requested screening and all had histologically confirmed short-segment Barrett's oesophagus. This kindred appears to be genetically susceptible to Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Pooling of data from this and other Barrett's families may allow successful linkage analysis.
