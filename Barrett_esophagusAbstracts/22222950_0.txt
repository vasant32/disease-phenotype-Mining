 BACKGROUND: The prevalence of inlet patches and their association with other conditions of the gastrointestinal tract have been studied prospectively in tertiary care facilities; little is known about practice patterns in private outpatient clinics and endoscopy centres. AIMS: To assess prevalence, demographic determinants, and associated clinicopathologic features of inlet patches in patients who had oesophagogastroduodenoscopy in outpatient settings throughout the United States. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the clinicopathologic records of 487,229 unique patients who had oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies between January 2008 and December 2010. RESULTS: There were 870 patients with inlet patches with a prevalence of 0.18%. Significant associations included male gender (OR 1.68), dysphagia (OR 1.34), upper respiratory complaints (OR 2.81), globus (OR 5.39) Barrett oesophagus (OR 1.55), and adenocarcinomas arising in Barrett mucosa (OR 5.64). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of inlet patches in a tertiary care setting (0.18%) was considerably lower than reported in prospective studies (3.7% on average). Inlet patches were significantly associated with male gender, dysphagia, upper respiratory complaints, globus, Barrett mucosa, and adenocarcinomas arising in Barrett oesophagus. Further studies will be needed to determine if patients with inlet patches and Barrett mucosa benefit from increased surveillance.
