The esophagus is involved by a wide range of pathologic processes that can be detected, defined, and staged with computed tomography (CT). These processes include esophageal carcinoma; benign esophageal tumors; inflammatory and infectious diseases; miscellaneous conditions such as Barrett esophagus, achalasia, and varices; and trauma and perforation. CT is usually performed to clarify findings seen with other imaging modalities or to stage a pathologic condition; however, it may be the primary imaging modality in some cases. Because of the critical location of the esophagus, it can be involved secondarily by other disease processes or as part of a systemic process. By being aware of the appearances of the various entities that affect the esophagus, the radiologist can play an important role in detecting and staging esophageal disease. Although the role of CT in the evaluation of esophageal disease has been controversial, recent developments such as spiral CT have the potential to renew interest in this application.
