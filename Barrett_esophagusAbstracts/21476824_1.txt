 AIM: To estimate the economic consequences for society arising from populations with poorly treated gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus in Germany, Italy and Spain. METHODS: The following epidemiologic data were used: total population figures, the prevalence and incidence of GERD and its complications, and data on patients with poorly treated GERD, as well as data on treatment costs and active workers' presenteeism and absenteeism. These data were used to calculate the economic consequences arising from the population with poorly treated GERD and Barrett's esophagus for the healthcare system and employers in each country. RESULTS: The size of the population with poorly treated GERD with Barrett's esophagus was estimated to be 29,678 in Spain, 19,327 in Germany and 10,079 in Italy. Costs for the healthcare systems in Spain, Germany and Italy for the population with poorly treated GERD with Barrett's esophagus were estimated to be €18, 12 and 7 million, respectively, for each country. Total costs for absenteeism and presenteeism for employers due to poorly treated GERD with Barrett's esophagus were €10 million for Germany, €1 million for Italy and none for Spain. CONCLUSION: Costs due to poorly treated GERD with Barrett's esophagus represent a substantial burden for the healthcare systems of all three studied countries. Costs for employers owing to absenteeism or presenteeism of employees were low or no costs were found.
