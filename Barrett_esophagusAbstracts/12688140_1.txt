 UNLABELLED: Barrett's esophagus (BE) the serious complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is discussed. BE has been defined as the complete intestinal metaplasia of distal esophagus. The most serious complication of BE is esophageal adenocarcinoma. We present our results with the group of patients with GERD from the years 1998-2000. We prospectively followed 67 patients with GERD (group A) and 8 patients with GERD/BE (group B). All patients underwent laparoscopic fundoplication. The average length of the Barrett's segment was 4.3 cm. Average time of the surgery was 75 min. Nissen fundoplication was used in seven cases in group B, in one case we used Rossetti laparoscopic fundoplication. The postoperative endoscopic controls were performed at two months after surgery and then every one-year. RESULTS: In one case we observed the complete reepithelization with the mixed spinocelullar and columnar components. We didn't observe any one case of histological deterioration. There was on any difference between two groups regarding the subjective complains. Six patients form group B reported complete disappearing of pyrosis. Two patients reported significant improvement, with very rare pyrosis or dysphagia. Our experience (together with the literature) proved the surgical antireflux therapy is very safe, very effective and with very long lasting effect. The effectivity of surgical therapy is increased by the laparoscopy. Described laparoscopic approaches can lead to the reepithelization of Barrett's metaplasia or, at least, they can diminish the symptoms without any long-term medication. Surveillance endoscopy and biopsy are strictly recommended in all patients with BE and also in the patients with BE after antireflux surgery. The intervals depend on the grade of dysplasia in metaplastic epithelium.
