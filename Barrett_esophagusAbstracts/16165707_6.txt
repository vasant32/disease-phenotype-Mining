 OBJECTIVE: The epidemiology of Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is characterized by divergent results. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of BO and intestinal metaplasia (IM) at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) in a population-based series of patients referred for first-time gastroscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent endoscopy for the first time at endoscopy units exclusively serving defined catchment areas were invited to take part in the study. Biopsies were taken immediately below the GOJ and from the distal oesophagus, and clinical data were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 769 patients (mean age 53 years, 43% M) were examined. Overall IM prevalence was 14%. BO was noted in 4%. Overall, the prevalence of IM increased by 8% (95% CI 6-10%) per year of age. BO patients were predominately women (69%). Presence of cardia-type mucosa in the cardia increased with age from 25% among the youngest to 59% among the oldest patients. Pancreatic acinar metaplasia (PAM) was found in 18%. CONCLUSIONS: While BO is not common among Swedish gastroscopy patients, IM and PAM are found in every 7th and 6th patient, respectively. Age-dependent increments in prevalence suggest that not only BO and IM, but also cardia-type mucosa are acquired and/or progressive lesions.
