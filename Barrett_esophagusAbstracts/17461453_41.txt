 AIM: To investigate risk factors associated with Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: This all-Ireland population-based case-control study recruited 224 Barrett's oesophagus patients, 227 oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients and 260 controls. All participants underwent a structured interview with information obtained about potential lifestyle and environmental risk factors. RESULTS: Gastro-oesophageal reflux was associated with Barrett's [OR 12.0 (95% CI 7.64-18.7)] and oesophageal adenocarcinoma [OR 3.48 (95% CI 2.25-5.41)]. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients were more likely than controls to be ex- or current smokers [OR 1.72 (95% CI 1.06-2.81) and OR 4.84 (95% CI 2.72-8.61) respectively] and to have a high body mass index [OR 2.69 (95% CI 1.62-4.46)]. No significant associations were observed between these risk factors and Barrett's oesophagus. Fruit but not vegetables were negatively associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma [OR 0.50 (95% CI 0.30-0.86)]. CONCLUSION: A high body mass index, a diet low in fruit and cigarette smoking may be involved in the progression from Barrett's oesophagus to oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
