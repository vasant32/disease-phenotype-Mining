The prevalence of gallstones in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) and their gallbladder motility relative to that of healthy volunteers and GERD patients without BE were investigated. Of the 707 patients reviewed, 203 (125 males and 78 females) had BE. The prevalence of gallstones was significantly higher in the patients with BE than in those without BE (34 vs. 20%, respectively). The gallbladder functions of 22 patients with GERD, 27 patients with BE and 21 healthy volunteers were assessed by ultrasonography before and after a test meal. The patients with BE had significantly higher fasting volume and residual volume, but lower ejection volume, ejection fraction and ejection rate values than those of the healthy controls. None of the ultrasonographic parameters of patients without BE were significantly different from those of the controls. Patients with BE have a more complex gastrointestinal motility disorder that involves the gallbladder, and this makes this subset of patients with GERD more prone to gallstone disease.
