Multiple endoscopic biopsy specimens of esophageal mucosa were received from a 13-year-old castrated male standard Poodle. The dog was presented for painful swallowing. Endoscopically, the distal aspect of the esophagus was inflamed with a polypoid mass that protruded into the esophageal lumen. Histologically, the stratified squamous epithelium overlying the mass and lining the adjacent esophageal mucosa was replaced by papillary projections covered by columnar epithelium with goblet cells supported by a fibrous stroma. This article reports a case of spontaneous esophageal adenomatous polyp with intestinal metaplasia (Barrett esophagus) and reviews the pathogenesis of esophageal metaplasia and adenocarcinoma.
