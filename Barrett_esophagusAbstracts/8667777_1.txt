At the Dept of Surgery, Lund University, during the 10-year period 1985-95, 54 patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction (17 with Barrett's epithelium, and 37 without) underwent oesophageal resection: oesophagectomy and gastric pull-up (n = 10), extended total gastrectomy (n = 37), or oesophageal resection and interposition of colon (n = 2) or jejunum (n = 5). Hospital mortality was 3.7% (2/54), and the mean duration of hospitalisation 13 days (range, 9-42). Long-term survival was significantly better in the Barrett's oesophagus subgroup than in the carcinoma of the cardia (non-Barrett's oesophagus) subgroup, the respective rates being 50% vs. 10% (p = 0.0052; Log rank test). The better survival in the Barrett's oesophagus subgroup is probably to be explained by the earlier stage of disease among these patients, in turn due to a history of gastro-oesophageal reflux, whereas the predominant symptom in the cardia carcinoma subgroup was dysphagia.
