The differential diagnosis "high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia" or "well-differentiated Barrett's adenocarcinoma limited to the mucosa" is controversial. We investigated 277 endoscopically resected specimens of early Barrett's carcinoma. Depth of infiltration was classified as follows: m 1=carcinoma limited to Barrett's mucosa; m 2=carcinoma infiltrating the neo-muscularis mucosae; m 3=infiltration of the original lamina propria of the esophageal mucosa; m 4=infiltration of the original muscularis mucosae; sm 1, sm 2, and sm 3=infiltration into the upper third, middle third, and lower third of the submucosa. The pattern of invasion was classified and graded as follows: tubular (D 0)=only neoplastic tubuli showing cytologic criteria of malignancy - no tumor cell dissociation; dissociation grade 1 (D 1)=few dissociated tumor cells; D 2=moderate amount of dissociated tumor cells; D 3=pronounced tumor cell dissociation. 74-96% of m 1-m 4 Barrett's carcinomas limited to the mucosa have a D 0-pattern. Tubular invasion decreases only when the submucosa has been infiltrated (sm 1: 70.4%, sm 2: 30.0%, sm 3: 24.0%). Our study shows that the pattern of invasion in early cancer in Barrett's esophagus statistically significantly depends on depth of infiltration.
