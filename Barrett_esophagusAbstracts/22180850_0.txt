Symptomatic gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common disease. The consequence of GERD is not only erosive esophagitis, but also esophageal stricture, Barrett's esophagus and extra-esophageal damage (including the lungs, throat, sinuses, middle ear and teeth). GERD and Barrett's esophagus are also identified as major risk factors for esophageal carcinoma. Therapy with melatonin prevents esophageal injury from acid-pepsin and acid-pepsin-bile exposure in animals, then further studies are required in humans to establish whether a melatonin supplement is able to protect the patients with GERD from erosions, Barrett's and neoplasia.
