BACKGROUND: Cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression has been reported to play an important role in the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in Barrett's oesophagus. However, the existence of cyclo-oxygenase-2 expressing cells in Barrett's epithelium is still uncertain. AIM: To identify the cells that express cyclo-oxygenase-2 protein and to investigate the relationship between cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression and mucin-phenotype of Barrett's epithelium. METHODS: Sections from 466 biopsy samples of Barrett's epithelium from 358 non-medicated patients were immunohistochemically examined for the cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression, mucin-phenotype, cell proliferation and apoptosis. RESULTS: Cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression was detected in 71.0% of Barrett's epithelium biopsy samples. In Barrett's epithelium with the gastric predominant mucin-phenotype, cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression was mainly found in stromal and deep epithelial cells, whereas in intestinal predominant mucin-phenotype, it was mostly in superficial epithelial cell. A significant elevation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen index and suppression of apoptotic index was observed in Barrett's epithelium with superficial epithelial cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression. Neither such elevation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen index nor the suppression of apoptotic index could be found in chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs users. CONCLUSIONS: Barrett's epithelium with intestinal mucin and superficial epithelial cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression possess a higher proliferation potential, but this risk may be thwarted by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs administration.
