Strict adherence to recommended surveillance intervals is important in ensuring timely access for patients awaiting endoscopy. This study aimed to characterise adherence rates to surveillance endoscopy guidelines. All surveillance procedures scheduled between January and December 2006 were reviewed. Surveillance procedures were classified as: a) Barrett's oesophagus, b) chronic IBD, c) prior adenomatous colorectal polyps and, d) prior surgical resection of colorectal cancer. 441 endoscopies were scheduled for surveillance of which 195 (44.2%) were scheduled at an inappropriate interval; all were scheduled prematurely. Of these, 50 of 133 (37.6%) Barrett's patients, 92 of 213 (43.2%) patients with prior colonic polyps, 36 of 48 (75.0%) patients with prior colonic malignancy and 17 of 47 (36.2%) patients for IBD surveillance were scheduled prematurely. Almost half of all surveillance procedures were scheduled inappropriately early. This 'over-surveillance' represents an unnecessary additional burden on the current endoscopic workload.
