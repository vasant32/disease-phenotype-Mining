Oncogenes, growth factors, cell surface receptors, and cell-cycle and apoptotic regulatory proteins have been implicated in the growth regulation and progression of Barrett's-associated neoplasia. Among these, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1-R) and c-Src are reported to be key regulators of mitogenesis and tumorigenesis. In addition, c-Src may exert its transforming capability by inducing increased expression of IGF1-R on the neoplastic cells. Bcl-X(L), a member of the Bcl-2 family, blocks apoptosis and has been reported to increase in Barrett's-associated neoplasia. To study the modifications in IGF1-R, c-Src, and Bcl-X(L) protein expression during the progression of Barrett's-associated neoplasia, we analyzed 34 resected gastroesophagectomy specimens by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to human IGF1-R, c-Src, and Bcl-X(L). In these cases, we found 22 intestinal (Barrett's) metaplasias (IMs), 25 low-grade dysplasias (LGDs), 28 high-grade dysplasias (HGDs), 34 invasive adenocarcinomas (CAs), and 19 lymph node metastases. High IGF1-R cytoplasmic staining was present in 14 of 19 (74%) node metastases, in 28 of 34 (82%) CAs, in 18 of 28 (64%) HGDs, in 13 of 25 (52%) LGDs, and in 5 of 22 (23%) IMs. Strong and diffuse c-Src expression was identified in 17 of 19 (89%) node metastases, in 29 of 34 (85%) Cas, in 26 of 28 (93%) HGDs, in 18 of 25 (72%) LGDs, and in 9 of 22 (41%) IMs. Bcl-X(L) cytoplasmic staining was evident in 12 of 19 (63%) node metastases, in 20 of 34 (59%) Cas, in 20 of 28 (71%) HGDs, in 15 of 25 (60%) LGDs, and in 6 of 22 (27%) IMs. In 11 cases, c-Src activity was measured by kinase assay and reflected the immunohistochemical results. Our data indicate that expression levels of IGF1-R, c-Src, and Bcl-X(L) proteins are coordinately elevated in Barrett's-associated neoplasia. These findings indicate important roles of these growth regulatory proteins in the malignant progression of Barrett's-associated neoplasia.
