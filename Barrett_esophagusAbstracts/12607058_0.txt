When the distal esophagus is covered with columnar gastric mucosa up to 2 cm from the esophagogastric junction it is considered normal. If the distal esophagus is covered with columnar epithelium more than 2 cm from the esophagogastric junction, it is called Barrett's esophagus. We have developed a new chromoesophagoscopic method to improve diagnostic testing for Barrett's esophagus. The distinctive feature of this method is that 4 to 5 ml of a 1% solution of neutral red is administered intravenously, after which excretion of the stain by the esophageal mucosa is examined by endoscopy. Chromoesophagoscopy has been carried out in 11 patients with reflux esophagitis. It revealed Barrett's esophagus in four patients, which was proved by histologic evaluation of biopsy specimens obtained from the stained zone of the esophageal mucosa. These observations suggest that chromoesophagoscopy is an effective, accessible, feasible, safe method for diagnosing Barrett's esophagus. It allows us to determine the length of the metaplastic epithelium and the topography of gastric glands; it also allows us to examine parietal cells in the esophagus and estimate the functional activity of these parietal cells in metaplastic epithelium.
