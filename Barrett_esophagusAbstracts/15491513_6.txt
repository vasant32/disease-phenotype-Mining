Barrett's esophagus is a precancerous condition characterized by replacement of the normal stratified squamous epithelium by a simple columnar epithelium with goblet cells that secrete an acidic mucin. As originally formulated, fresh solutions of zirconyl hematoxylin stain goblet cells poorly. An improved formula, quintupling the amount of oxidant, yields zirconyl hematoxylin solutions that stain goblet cells darkly even when fresh. The improved zirconyl hematoxylin can be used in place of alcian blue in the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus. The ingredients of zirconyl hematoxylin are always readily available and are generally recognized as safe.
