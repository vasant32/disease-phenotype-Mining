 BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigate the use of PET scanning in the carcinogenic progression of reflux esophagitis to Barrett's esophagus to high grade dysplasia to esophageal adenocarcinoma, and correlate the uptake levels of 18F-FDG related to histological changes, and the rates of proliferation and apoptosis. METHODS: An established esophagoduodenal anastomsis rat model in conjunction with micro-PET scanning at 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, and 6 month after procedure was performed. RESULTS: Increased uptake levels of 18F-FDG were observed in the esophagi after EDA procedure. The higher level of 18F-FDG uptake within esophageal epithelium was identified in intestinal metaplastic transformation and esophagoduodenal adenocarcinoma by histological examination. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic PET scanning represents a powerful tool in analyzing morphological carcinogenic transformation non-invasively in the esophagus. 18F- FDG accumulation was a sensitive marker in reflux esophageal injury carcinogenic progression from intestinal metaplasia to EAC.
