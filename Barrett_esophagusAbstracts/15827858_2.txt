Laparoscopic antireflux surgery is the gold standard procedure for treatment of patients with reflux esophagitis. The current results of the laparoscopic approach are absolutely comparables with the results obtained during the open surgery era. The Nissen, Nissen-Rossetti, or Toupet techniques are the more frequently used. We have performed cardial calibration and posterior gastropexy or Nissen fundoplication by the open approach with similar results. The purpose of this article is to present the anatomo-physiological basis for employing cardial calibration and posterior gastropexy in patients with reflux esophagitis. This study includes 108 symptomatic patients, 12 of them with associated extraesophageal manifestations ( posterior laryngitis). Endoscopic mild or moderate esophagitis was confirmed in 83 patients, Barrett's esophagus in 12 patients, and type I or II hiatal hernia in 13 patients. All patients were also submitted to manometry, 24 hour intraesophageal pH monitoring, and barium swallow before and after surgery. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 36 months. There were no conversion, major intraoperative, or postoperative complications; nor were there any deaths. Postoperative dysphagia was present in 5% of cases. Symptomatic recurrence of reflux was observed in 10.3% and endoscopic presence of esophagitis in 12.3% of cases . Lower esophageal sphincter pressure increased significantly after surgery, even in patients with endoscopic recurrence. 24-hour intraesophageal monitoring improved after surgery, except in patients with objective recurrence of esophagitis. In conclusion, laparoscopic cardial calibration with posterior gastropexy presents comparable results to those reported after Nissen fundoplication and therefore could be another excellent therapeutic option in patients with reflux esophagitis.
