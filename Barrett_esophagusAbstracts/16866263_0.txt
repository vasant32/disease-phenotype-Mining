The purpose of the research was to study particular features of the cellular immune status and serum cytokines in patients with the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus. We have examined 70 patients with erosive GERD and 42 patients with Barrett's esophagus. Clinical, endoscopic, morphological and immunological study methods have been used. Distinctions in parameters of the cellular immune status and serum level of Interleukin-4, Interleukin-8, Interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma in patients with GERD in the dynamics of treatment and patients with Barrett's esophagus were determined.
