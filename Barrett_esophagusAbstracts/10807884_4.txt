BACKGROUND: Columnar lined (Barrett's) oesophagus is often considered a sequel to chronic severe reflux disease. Aberrant lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) motility associated with Barrett's oesophagus includes reduced basal LOS pressures. The aim of this study was to characterise neuromuscular function of the LOS in normal (squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with uninvolved LOS) and reflux affected (Barrett's) oesophagus in vitro. METHODS: Strips of LOS muscle were prepared at biopsy following oesophagectomy from 16 patients with SCC and seven patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's oesophagus associated with a history of reflux disease. LOS smooth muscle responses were recorded in response to electrical field stimulation (EFS), potassium chloride (KCl), DMPP, isoprenaline, capsaicin, bethanechol, and tachykinins. RESULTS: Basal LOS tone and LOS relaxations in response to isoprenaline, EFS, and DMPP were not significantly altered in the Barrett's group. After tetrodotoxin pretreatment, responses to KCl and DMPP were significantly reduced in the SCC but not in Barrett's LOS. Maximal contraction in response to bethanechol was significantly decreased in Barrett's LOS while substance P and NK-2 receptor mediated contraction was unaltered. Capsaicin, NK-1, and NK-3 receptor agonists exerted negligible effects on LOS tone. CONCLUSIONS: LOS muscle strips from patients with reflux associated Barrett's oesophagus exhibit a reduction in cholinergic muscle contraction while retaining similar features of basal tone, responses to tachykinins, and inhibitory muscle and neural function. Enteric inhibitory neurones in LOS muscle strips from patients with reflux associated Barrett's oesophagus display resistance to axonal sodium channel blockade. No evidence for functional NK-1 or NK-3 receptors or capsaicin sensitive axon collateral reflexes was observed in the human LOS.
