 BACKGROUND: The length of Barrett's esophagus is considered to be important because it is associated with the risk of neoplasia. In Japan, there is a high prevalence of short-segment columnar-lined esophagus (SS-CLE). The natural history of SS-CLE is not fully understood, so the aim of the present study was to investigate the chronological changes of SS-CLE. METHODS: The subjects were 500 consecutive patients with SS-CLE (327 men and 173 women; mean age: 64.0 years) diagnosed between January 2001 and July 2002 at our hospital based on the definition of SS-CLE proposed by the Japanese Society for Esophageal Diseases. Follow-up endoscopy was carried out annually for a mean period of 5.7 Â± 1.2 years. The cumulative probability of SS-CLE showing elongation was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and factors related to endoscopic findings making an independent contribution to elongation were determined with Cox's proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Elongation of SS-CLE occurred in 29 patients (5.8%) during the follow-up period and the cumulative 5-year probability of elongation was 16.6%. There was no progression of SS-CLE to Barrett's adenocarcinoma. The absence of atrophic gastritis (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 23.4; 95%CI [6.5, 83.8]), the presence of reflux esophagitis (aOR: 4.53; 95%CI [1.2, 16.4]), and the flame-shaped type of SS-CLE (aOR: 22.4; 95%CI [7.8, 64.0]) were found to be independent contributors to the elongation of SS-CLE. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that SS-CLE remains stable in length over time, especially in patients without atrophic gastritis, as well as in those with reflux esophagitis and/or flame-shaped SS-CLE at initial examination.
