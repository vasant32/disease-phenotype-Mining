The submucosal glands (SMGs) of the pig esophagus, like the human, secrete mucin and bicarbonate, which help in luminal acid clearance and epithelial protection. The aim of this study was to characterize histochemically the esophageal SMGs and a primary culture obtained from these glands. Tissues and cultures were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid Schiff, Alcian blue, lectins, or cytokeratins. In the perfused esophagus, addition of carbachol increased mucin secretion by approximately 2-fold. The results indicate that [1] a method for culturing SMG cells was developed; [2] conventional staining indicates the presence of sulfated, acidic, and neutral mucopolysaccharides in glands and cultures; [3] lectin binding indicates the presence of N-acetyl glucosamine, N-acetyl neuraminic acid, N-acetyl galactosamine, and alpha-L: -fucose in mucous cells and cultures; [4] cytokeratin and lectin staining indicated similarities with Barrett epithelium (columnar metaplasia of the esophagus); and [5] cholinergic agonists enhance mucin secretion and this could play a significant role in esophageal protection.
