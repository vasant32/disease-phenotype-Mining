In order to demonstrate the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the metaplastic epithelium of Barrett's oesophagus and to evaluate its possible association with this entity, we examined 29 cases of Barrett's oesophagus where concomitant antral biopsies were also available. These cases were compared with an equal number of age and sex matched controls of uncomplicated reflux oesophagitis. H. pylori was present in 11 of 29 cases of Barrett's oesophagus (38%). No increase in the frequency of H. pylori antral gastritis was found in patients of Barrett's oesophagus compared to the control group of uncomplicated reflux oesophagitis. The positivity of Barrett's oesophagus for H. pylori correlated with the presence of H. pylori antral gastritis (P < 0.05), although in two cases of H. pylori-positive Barrett's oesophagus antral biopsies were negative for H. pylori. No difference was found in the severity of inflammatory and dysplastic changes of H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative Barrett's oesophagus. Presence of H. pylori does not seem to alter the natural history of Barrett's oesophagus.
