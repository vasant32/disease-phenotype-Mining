Enzymatic activity responsible for the cleavage of heparan sulfate, commonly known as heparanase, is abundant in tumor-derived cells. Heparanase cleaves heparan sulfate side chains, presumably at sites of low sulfation, thus facilitating structural alterations of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane underlying epithelial and endothelial cells. Traditionally, heparanase activity was correlated with the metastatic potential of tumor-derived cells, attributed to enhanced cell dissemination as a consequence of heparan sulfate cleavage and remodeling of the extracellular matrix barrier. More recently, heparanase upregulation was documented in an increasing number of human carcinomas and hematological malignancies, correlating with increased tumor metastasis, vascular density, and shorter post-operative survival of cancer patients. Although heparanase upregulation and its pro-malignant features are well documented, the instance of its induction in the course of tumor development was less investigated. Here, we used immunohistochemical analysis to investigate heparanase expression in normal esophagus, Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia, Barrett's esophagus with low-grade dysplasia, Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. We report that heparanase expression is already induced in Barrett's epithelium without dysplasia, and is further increased during progression through distinct pathological stages, namely, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma. Notably, heparanase induction correlated with increased cell proliferation index revealed by Ki-67 staining. These findings suggest that heparanase function is not limited to the process of tumor metastasis, but rather is engaged at the early stages of esophagus carcinoma initiation and progression.
