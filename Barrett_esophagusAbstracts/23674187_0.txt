 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews reports on the prevalence of subsquamous intestinal metaplasia (SSIM) in patients with Barrett's esophagus, and the implications of SSIM in the neoplastic progression of Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma. RECENT FINDINGS: Endoscopic eradication therapy for dysplastic Barrett's esophagus has become an encouraging alternative to esophagectomy or continued endoscopic surveillance. However, the presence of SSIM before and after ablation is concerning because this tissue may have potential for malignant progression, is not visible by conventional endoscopy, and may evade detection by random esophageal biopsy sampling methods. Advances in endoscopic high-resolution three-dimensional optical coherence tomography recently have revealed SSIM in a majority of patients both before and after complete eradication of Barrett's esophagus by radiofrequency ablation. Studies suggest that although cells of Barrett's glands are highly proliferative, the cells of these buried glands are more dormant. Nevertheless, the malignant potential of SSIM cells remains undetermined. SUMMARY: Novel endoscopic imaging demonstrates that SSIM is present in the majority of patients with Barrett's esophagus, both before and after ablative therapy. Although these subsquamous cells exhibit less proliferative activity than those of typical surface Barrett's glands, the malignant potential of the buried glands, especially when challenged by injurious factors, remains largely unknown. Future methods to detect subsurface dysplasia will be needed.
