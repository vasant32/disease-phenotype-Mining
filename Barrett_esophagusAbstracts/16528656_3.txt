The role of endoscopy in reflux disease has changed from being primarily diagnostic to one of risk management. Objective studies of routine endoscopy have shown little change in outcomes after the examination. Screening and surveillance for Barrett's esophagus is still an unconfirmed strategy. In most developed countries, including western Europe and North America, middle-aged patients (over the age of 50) with gastroesophageal reflux disease would benefit more from colonoscopy than upper endoscopy.
