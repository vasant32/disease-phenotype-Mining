Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition; endoscopic surveillance is often performed to search for early adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. In an attempt to detect early changes of malignancy, we have added the use of flow cytometry to routine endoscopic surveillance procedures. DNA histograms were generated from biopsy samples by utilizing a specific DNA fluorochrome (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and flow cytometry. Sixty-three samples from patients with esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal malignancy were analyzed. An abnormal DNA histogram (aneuploidy) was detected in 79% of esophageal malignancies. In addition, aneuploidy was detected in seven patients with Barrett's esophagus, two of whom had dysplasia. DNA quantification with flow cytometry may be a useful adjunct in screening patients with Barrett's esophagus for early malignant change.
