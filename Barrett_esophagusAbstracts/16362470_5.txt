 BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for the regression of Barrett's esophagus in gastroesophageal reflux disease remains controversial. The aim of this study, therefore, was to review endoscopic findings and clinical changes after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease, particularly for patients with Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: From September 1995 through June 2004, 127 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. All the patients had clinical and endoscopic follow-up evaluation. We further analyzed the course of 37 consecutive patients with Barrett's esophagus (29% of all laparoscopic fundoplications performed in our institution) using endoscopic surveillance with appropriate biopsies and histologic evaluation. The median follow-up period for all the patients after fundoplication was 34 months (range, 3-108 months). The median follow-up period for the patients with Barrett's esophagus was 19 months (range, 3-76 months). RESULTS: During the 9-year period, 70 women (55 %) and 57 (45%) men were treated with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. The median age of these patients was 42 years (range, 7-81 years). The clinical results were considered excellent for 67 patients (53%), good for 51 patients (40%), fair for 7 patients (6%), and poor for 2 patients (1%). Endoscopic surveillance showed regression of the macroscopic columnar segment in 23 patients with Barrett's esophagus (62%). Regression at a histopathologic level occurred for 15 patients (40%). The histopathology remained unchanged for 14 patients with Barrett's esophagus (38%). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication effectively controls intestinal metaplasia and clinical symptoms in the majority of patients with Barrett's esophagus.
