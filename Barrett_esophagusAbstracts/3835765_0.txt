We present the patterns for the diagnosis, checking the clinical, radiological, endoscopical and histological data of 35 patients suffering from Barrett's Esophagus (BE) (columnar metaplasia lining the lower esophagus). The clinical characteristics are those of a severe esophagitis of long evolution, although metaplasia itself is asymptomatic, and its features depend on the inflammation degree. Radiology can bring out some data as GE reflux, hiatal hernia, ulcers or stricture, and perhaps double contrast may show any sign by means of which endobrachyesophagus (EBE) can be suspected. Endoscopy provides us with accurate data about EBE, ulcers, stricture and inflammation. Histology reveals the type of columnar metaplasia (junctional or cardial, gastric fundic, intestinal or specialized, or composite). Acquired or congenital etiology can be clarified by an immunohistochemical method, Peroxidase anti-Peroxidase (PAP), showing the presence of gastrin secretory cells (G cells) in the congenital cases.
