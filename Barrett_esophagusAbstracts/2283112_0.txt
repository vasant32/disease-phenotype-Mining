Nissen fundoplication was performed in 20 patients suffering from esophageal reflux. Failure of medical therapy was the indication in 60% of the patients, and complications of reflux (bleeding, stricture, Barrett's esophagus) in the others. There was no operative mortality; wound infection was the most common postoperative complication (4 patients). Follow-up after 1-8 years showed good results in 85%. The results of Nissen fundoplication in the world literature, as well as in this series, prove it to be effective for esophageal reflux. Those not responding to appropriate medical therapy should be referred earlier for surgery, prior to development of the complications of reflux.
