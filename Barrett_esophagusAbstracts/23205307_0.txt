Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is considered the most accurate tool for the TNM staging of esophageal cancer, but its role in early Barrett's neoplasia is still debatable. The aim was to evaluate the utility of EUS in Barrett's patients prior to therapy. Retrospective review of 109 patients enrolled in a treatment protocol for Barrett's neoplasia in our institution. EUS assessment was classified as suspicious for invasion in 19 patients; 84% of them had no evidence of invasion in final pathology. The assessment of depth of invasion of Barrett's neoplasia based solely on EUS findings leads to overstaging in most patients.
