 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether macroscopic changes resulting from acetic acid application on the surface of columnar-lined esophagus allow regular, nonmagnifying, endoscopic identification of areas presenting dysplasia and/or cancer in Barrett's esophagus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients (mean age, 53 years; range, 27-86 years) under surveillance because of short-segment (n=71) and long-segment (n=29) Barrett's esophagus, with no alterations of columnar-lined esophagus on standard endoscopy, were enrolled. After endoscopic examination, 3% acetic acid was sprayed on columnar-lined esophagus. The subsequent appearance of the mucosa was classified as: (1) Normal pattern: uniform reticulum along the entire columnar-lined esophagus. (2) Abnormal pattern: reticulum presenting areas of rough or irregular appearance. Biopsy samples were obtained from areas of normal and abnormal patterns, and the results of the corresponding histological studies were compared. All endoscopies were performed by the same investigator. RESULTS: The endoscopic appearance, after acetic acid application, corresponded to a normal pattern in 85% of cases and an abnormal pattern in 15%. The percentage of dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in biopsy specimens was significantly higher in patients with rough or irregular areas (86.7%) than in those with normal uniform reticulum (0%) (P< 0.001). Sensitivity for the identification of areas of dysplasia or adenocarcinoma was 100% (95% confidence interval: 71.7-100%). Specificity was 97.7% (95% confidence interval: 91.2-99.6%). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study shows that acetic acid test is useful for standard, nonmagnifying, endoscopic detection of dysplasia and cancer in Barrett's esophagus.
