 OBJECTIVE: To determine accurately the incidence of heterotopic gastric mucosa in the upper esophagus (HGMUE) in China, and to study the macroscopic and microscopic aspects of the lesions and to evaluate the clinical importance of HGMUE. METHODS: A prospective study was made among a total of 15,228 consecutive patients, 8,573 male and 6,655 female, aged 54 (8-95), undergoing gastroscopy. Disease histories of all patients were carefully inquired, especially those regarding possible complaints including discomfort of throat and swallowing pain and so on. Special care was taken in the upper esophageal sphincter area to make sure whether the area was adequately inspected. Biopsy specimens from aberrant mucosa were obtained and the sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and Giemsa stain for Helicobacter pylori. RESULTS: HGMUE was found in 39 patients (0.26%) with an average age of 50. Five patients with H. pylori infection in heterotopic gastric mucosa also presented the infection in the stomach. The gastric mucosa was gastric body type in 8 patients, transitional type in 11 patients, and antral pattern in 7 patients. Intestinal metaplasia was found in 5 patients, and mild atypical hyperplasia in 2 patients. An impressive finding was coexistent erosive gastritis in 14 patients (35.9%), Barrett's esophagus in one patient (2.6%), peptic ulcer in 8 patients (20.5%), and a patient had the complication of constriction in the upper esophagus. CONCLUSION: HGMUE is not rare in China. The presence of inlet patches is possibly correlated with specific symptoms. There are some severe complications in HGMUE, especially esophageal constriction. Close surveillance should be taken for rare cases with metaplasia or dysplasia in HGMUE.
