 OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of unsedated transnasal endoscopy (uTNE) and video capsule endoscopy (VCE) as alternatives to sedated endoscopy (sEGD) as screening tools for Barrett esophagus (BE) and to obtain preliminary estimates of participation rates for sEGD, uTNE, and VCE when used for community BE screening in a population cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From February 1, 2009, to May 31, 2010, patients from Olmsted County, Minnesota, who were older than 50 years and had no history of known BE were randomized (stratified by age, sex, reflux symptoms noted in a validated questionnaire) into 3 groups for esophageal evaluation with sEGD, uTNE, or VCE. Participation rates and safety profiles were estimated. RESULTS: We contacted 127 patients to recruit 20 for each procedure arm (60 total). The probability of participation was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26%-51%) for sEGD, 50% (95% CI, 35%-65%) for uTNE, and 59% (95% CI, 42%-74%) for VCE. Both uTNE and VCE were well tolerated without adverse effects. BE was identified in 3 patients and esophagitis in 8. CONCLUSION: Unsedated techniques may be acceptable, feasible, and safe alternatives to sEGD to screen for BE in the community. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00943280.
