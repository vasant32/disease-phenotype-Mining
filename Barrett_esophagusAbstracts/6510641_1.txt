Twenty-eight patients with Barrett's esophagus were studied and strictures were present in 13. Two strictures were malignant. Of the 11 benign strictures, six were located at the squamocolumnar junction, while five were located below the squamocolumnar junction. Contrary to previous reports, benign esophageal strictures often occur below the squamocolumnar junction in patients with Barrett's esophagus.
