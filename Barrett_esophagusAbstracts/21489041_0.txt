Esophageal heterotopic gastric mucosa (HGM) is not uncommon and can be seen in up to 10% of the general population among numerous reports and epidemiologic studies which have been essentially performed in adult population. Pediatric data are still limited. Diagnosis requires clinician awareness of symptomatic cases who present with dysphagia or swallowing difficulties, and thorough endoscopic examination is crucial. Early detection of cases provides favorable clinical outcome and may prevent potential significant or serious long-term consequences such as esophageal stricture or web, Barrett's esophagus or malignant transformation in pediatric population. We reported a 14-year-old male who presented with 1-year history of gradually worsening dysphagia and was found to have two salmon-colored patches, which resemble gastric mucosa, in the proximal esophagus causing significant esophageal stricture. Gastric cardiac-type mucosa with acute and chronic inflammation was documented on biopsy. After several sessions of balloon dilation and endoscopic treatment, the HGM and esophageal stricture resolved and he became asymptomatic.
