 BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is safe and effective for eradicating neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate RFA for eradicating early esophageal squamous cell neoplasia (ESCN) defined as moderate-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (MGIN) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and early flat-type esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Esophageal unstained lesions (USLs) were identified using Lugol's chromoendoscopy. Inclusion criteria were at least 1 flat (type 0-IIb) USL 3 cm or larger, USL-bearing esophagus 12 cm or less, and a consensus diagnosis of MGIN, HGIN, or ESCC by 2 expert GI pathologists. Exclusion criteria were previous endoscopic resection or ablation, stricture, or any nonflat mucosa. INTERVENTIONS: Circumferential RFA creating a continuous treatment area (TA) including all USLs. At 3-month intervals thereafter, chromoendoscopy with biopsies followed by focal RFA of USLs, if present. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Complete response (CR) at 12 months defined as absence of MGIN, HGIN, or ESCC in the TA, CR after 1 RFA session, neoplastic progression from baseline, and adverse events. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (14 male, mean age 60.3 years) with MGIN (n = 18), HGIN (n = 10), or ESCC (n = 1) participated. Mean USL length was 6.2 cm (TA 8.2 cm). At 3 months after 1 RFA session, 86% of patients (25/29) had a CR. At 12 months, 97% of patients (28/29) had a CR. There was no neoplastic progression. There were 4 strictures, all dilated to resolution. LIMITATIONS: Single-center study with limited number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early ESCN (MGIN, HGIN, flat-type ESCC), RFA was associated with a high rate of histological complete response (97% of patients), no neoplastic progression, and an acceptable adverse event profile.
