 AIM: To determine the inter-observer agreement and validity of the LA Classification in scoring the severity of esophagitis in Asian patients. METHODS: Video endoscopy clips were selected from 45 consecutive patients participating in reflux studies. The videos were viewed by endoscopists who then independently scored the presence, severity and distribution of esophagitis, including endoscopically suspected Barrett's esophagus (ESBE). Each video was discussed and a consensus on findings reached. Kappa (k) correlation was calculated to describe inter-observer agreement. RESULTS: Thirty-five clips were scored (no esophagitis 20%, grade-A 54%, grade-B 23%, grade-C 3%, respectively and 10 clips were excluded for poor imaging). Excellent agreement was noted on the presence of esophagitis (mean k = 0.79, range 0.77-0.82). Fifteen patients (42%) had ESBE with a mean k of 0.48 (range 0.39-0.60). Inter-observer agreement on the LA grade was good (mean k = 0.58, range 0.55-0.63), whilst in agreement between endoscopists and consensus grading, the mean kappa rose to 0.77 (range 0.73-0.81). There was a trend of increasing agreement as viewings progressed, with superior kappa correlation after 16 cases. Evaluation of the extent of esophagitis showed good k values using the alternative approach of grouping by circumferential extent (mean k = 0.64, range 0.60-0.67) at the lower categories of severity. CONCLUSIONS: Scoring using the LA classification for esophagitis and the concurrence on the presence of ESBE showed moderate to strong agreement amongst Asian endoscopists. Our results also suggested that an alternative method of scoring esophagitis based on proportion of circumferential involvement was reliable. A learning effect was observed and reliable scoring was achieved after 16 patients.
