In 1991-1999 the authors performed at the First Surgical Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Olomouc extirpation of the oesophagus on account of carcinoma in 133 patients. This number comprised only four patients with a tumour in its early stage. In all these instances an adenocarcinoma in Barrett's oesophagus was involved. The authors emphasize, that the generally poor prognosis of patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus is influenced to a considerably extent by its late diagnosis. The finding of carcinoma of the oesophagus in the early stage of the disease is usually possible only in case of malignization of Barrett's oesophagus. This is the reason why Barrett's oesophagus should be dealt with only in specialized departments concerned with diseases of the oesophagus in general.
