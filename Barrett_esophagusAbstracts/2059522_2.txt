An evaluation was made of 34 patients having Barrett's oesophagus. Medical therapy consisted of antacids, H2 blockers, orthopramides, and postural measures (20 cases, mean follow-up 2.9 years). A Nissen fundoplication was done in 14 cases (mean follow-up 2.5 years). Clinical, endoscopic and histologic evaluation was done in all patients and pH measurements also done in all operated cases. Clinical results have been excellent in 70% of medically treated patients and in 100% of surgically treated ones, pH measurements were between normal limits in all operated patients. However, recovery of the normal epithelium did not occur in any case, except for some partial improvement in one patient treated surgically.
