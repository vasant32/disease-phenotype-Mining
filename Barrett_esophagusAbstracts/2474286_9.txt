Fifty-eight patients had surgery for carcinoma of the esophagus at Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, Calif, from 1976 to 1986. Esophagectomy with reconstruction by colon interposition was done in 24 patients with adenocarcinoma arising in columnar-lined epithelium (Barrett's). In 5 patients, obstructive symptoms had not yet developed and the diagnosis was made by endoscopy performed for evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux. Dysphagia had just started in 12 additional patients and no weight loss had been noted. The operation was palliative in 14 patients and potentially curative in the other 10. Only 3 patients had negative lymph nodes. Ten patients were alive after 2 to 11 years. Encouraging results were indicated for surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus developing in Barrett's epithelium. A good outcome can be obtained with resection even in patients with lymph node metastases.
