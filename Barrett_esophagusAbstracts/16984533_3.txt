Thus far, there has been a paucity of studies that have assessed the value of the different gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptom characteristics in identifying patients with long-segment Barrett's esophagus versus those with short-segment Barrett's esophagus. To determine if any of the symptom characteristics of GERD correlates with long-segment Barrett's esophagus versus short-segment Barrett's esophagus. Patients seen in our Barrett's clinic were prospectively approached and recruited into the study. All patients underwent an endoscopy, validated GERD symptoms questionnaire and a personal interview. Of the 88 Barrett's esophagus patients enrolled into the study, 47 had short-segment Barrett's esophagus and 41 long-segment Barrett's esophagus. Patients with short-segment Barrett's esophagus reported significantly more daily heartburn symptoms (84.1%) than patients with long-segment Barrett's esophagus (63.2%, P = 0.02). There was a significant difference in reports of severe to very severe dysphagia in patients with long-segment Barrett's esophagus versus those with short-segment Barrett's esophagus (76.9%vs. 38.1%, P = 0.02). Longer duration in years of chest pain was the only symptom characteristic of gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with longer lengths of Barrett's mucosa. Reports of severe or very severe dysphagia were more common in long-segment Barrett's esophagus patients. Only longer duration of chest pain was correlated with longer lengths of Barrett's esophagus.
