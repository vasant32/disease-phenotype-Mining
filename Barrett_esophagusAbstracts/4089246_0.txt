The authors analyze their experience on 9 cases of esophageal stenosis dilated by "Gr√ºntzig" type balloon catheter under fluoroscopic examination (transluminal esophagus plastica: TE). This procedure also allows dilatation of severe narrowing, offering distinct advantages represented by: low risk, easy performance, good tolerance, reduction or disappearance of disphagia. Esophageal perforation is possible, though it never appeared in author's experience.
