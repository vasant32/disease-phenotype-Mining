Eagle Barrett syndrome (EBS) is characterized by the triad of abdominal muscle deficiency, urinary tract abnormalities, and cryptorchidism. Approximately 25% of patients with EBS progress to end-stage renal disease. It is speculated that the abdominal muscular defects in EBS pose technical problems in achieving successful peritoneal dialysis (PD). In this retrospective analysis, we reviewed the medical records of EBS and non-EBS PD patients cared for at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital from 1985 to 2002; 5 EBS and 9 non-EBS patients were analyzed. PD duration, total complication rates, and catheter usage rates in the two groups were not significantly different. The two most frequent complications were peritonitis and catheter mechanical malfunction during 103 patient-months in EBS patients and 296 patient-months in non-EBS patients. Peritonitis occurred 1 episode every 20.6 patient-months and 14.8 patient-months in EBS and non-EBS patients, respectively. The time from PD initiation to onset of any complication, including first peritonitis, was not significantly different in the two groups. Although the age at PD initiation was significantly different between the groups, there was no correlation between age at onset of PD and complication rates or time to first complication. Despite their abdominal muscle defects, EBS patients do not have more-frequent PD complications.
