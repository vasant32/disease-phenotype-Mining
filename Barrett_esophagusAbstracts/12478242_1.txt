Barrett's esophagus--intestinal metaplasia within the tubular esophagus - is a premalignant histologic lesion and a marker of cancer risk. Strategies to prevent Barrett's-related esophageal cancer have focused on reversal of Barrett's using pharmacological or surgical antireflux therapies and endoscopically-induced injury. Currently, however, there is little compelling evidence to support the reversal of Barrett's through pharmacological or surgical therapy, and endoscopic reversal of Barrett's has not yet been validated. Chemoprevention using intensive acid suppression and/or inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs remains a biologically plausible strategy that is supported by a rapidly growing body of scientific evidence. Data suggest that a combination of acid suppression with COX-2 inhibition might be the most effective chemopreventive strategy. Whether this approach is effective awaits the results of well-designed outcomes studies.
