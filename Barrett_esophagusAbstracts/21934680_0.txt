 BACKGROUND: Dysplasia is a marker of cancer risk in Barrett's oesophagus (BO), but this risk is variable and diagnosis is subject to inter-observer variability. Cancer risk in BO is increased when chromosomal instability is present. Nucleotyping (NT) is a new method that uses high-resolution digital images of nuclei to assess chromatin organisation both quantitatively and qualitatively. We aimed to evaluate NT as a marker of dysplasia in BO and compare with image cytometric DNA analysis (ICM). METHODS: In all, 120 patients with BO were studied. The non-dysplastic group (n=60) had specialised intestinal metaplasia only on two consecutive endoscopies after 51 months median follow-up (IQR=25-120 months). The dysplastic group (n=60) had high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma in situ. The two groups were then randomly assigned to a training set and a blinded test set in a 1:1 ratio. Image cytometric DNA analysis and NT was then carried out on Feulgen-stained nuclear monolayers. RESULTS: The best-fit model for NT gave a correct classification rate (CCR) for the training set of 83%. The test set was then analysed using the same textural features and yielded a CCR of 78%. Image cytometric DNA analysis alone yielded a CCR of 73%. The combination of ICM and NT yielded a CCR of 84%. CONCLUSION: Nucleotyping differentiates dysplastic and non-dysplastic BO, with a greater sensitivity than ICM. A combination score based on both techniques performed better than either test in isolation. These data demonstrate that NT/ICM on nuclear monolayers is a very promising single platform test of genomic instability, which may aid pathologists in the diagnosis of dysplasia and has potential as a biomarker in BO.
