BACKGROUND: Precise endoscopic measurement of esophageal landmarks is difficult and inaccurate because of the ability of the esophagus to lengthen and foreshorten. METHODS: Nineteen patients enrolled to date in a study of Barrett's esophagus had an India ink tattoo placed at the most proximal level of the squamocolumnar junction and were examined endoscopically at 3, 9, 15, 24, and 36 months. RESULTS: Eighteen of nineteen patients (94.7%) were judged to have a good to excellent tattoo persistence at 3 months. One of the 19 patients (5.3%) had poor tattoo persistence and was retattooed at the 3-month interval. Eventually, 15 of the 15 patients (100%) who remained in the study had a good or excellent tattoo persistence at 36 months. There were no complications related to India ink tattooing including chest pain, bleeding, or perforation. At follow-up endoscopy, no ulcers, inflammation, break in the mucosa, or pain were noted. CONCLUSION: India ink tattooing in the esophagus is safe and persistent and may be used as an effective method for longitudinal follow-up of lesions in the esophagus.
