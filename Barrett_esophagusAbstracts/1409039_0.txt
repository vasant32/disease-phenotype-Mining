A pathogenetic outline of oesophageal inflammatory lesions with special emphasis on Barrett's oesophagitis has been presented. As recorded in a history of a 65-year old patient at first the stenocardia-mimicking pains occurred a few days after appendectomy. Gastrobulboscopy performed (after coronary insufficiency had been excluded) revealed extensive inflammatory and erosive lesions of the oesophagus and multiple ulcerations of the duodenum. According to the several authors the rapid manifestation of the inflammatory lesions of the oesophagus may be related to the intubation necessary for laparotomy. It may refer particularly to diabetic patients. Control endoscopies showed that a six-week treatment resulted in a total disappearance of mucosal changes. It might be thoughtful to take into consideration a possibility of oesophageal inflammation in clinical differentiation of stenocardia mimicking pains in diabetics who underwent the intubation.
