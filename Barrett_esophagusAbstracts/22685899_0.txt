Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common gastrointestinal disorder in the United States. Without proper treatment, patients may be at risk for long-term complications including Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Because reflux is a common complaint, clinicians need to know how to rule out causes other than GERD and how to treat patients suspected of having GERD. This article discusses how to diagnose GERD, the medical and surgical treatment options, and how to evaluate patients who are at risk for long-term complications.
