The rate of recurrence of reflux esophagitis after classic antireflux surgery (fundoplication) is 10-15%. This rate is different in patients with esophagitis with and without Barrett's esophagus. We evaluated the clinical and laboratory findings in 104 patients with postoperative recurrent reflux esophagitis, determining the results of repeat antireflux surgery or an acid suppression-bile diversion procedure. Repeat fundoplication was performed in 26 patients, and truncal vagotomy, antrectomy, and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy in 78 patients. Esophagectomy as a third operation was performed in seven patients. After repeat antireflux surgery, endoscopic evaluation demonstrated improvement of esophagitis in a small proportion of patients. Barrett's esophagus remained unchanged, and no regression of ulcer or stricture was observed. These complications improved significantly after acid suppression-bile diversion surgery. Incompetent lower esophageal sphincter (LES) was present in 55.8% after initial surgery and in 23% after reoperation. Acid reflux, initially present in 94.6% of patients, was also observed in 93.6% after fundoplication, 68.8% after redo fundoplication, and 16.6% after treatment with the acid suppression-bile diversion technique. A positive Bilitec test was present in 78% of patients before the operation and 56.6% after the repeat operation, and was negative after bile diversion surgery. Among 13 patients (50%) submitted to repeat surgery alone, esophagectomy as a third operation was necessary as a result of severe non-dilatable stricture in seven patients. Our conclusions are that repeat antireflux surgery alone failed to improve Barrett's esophagus complications and that the best results were obtained in patients submitted to acid suppression-bile diversion surgery.
