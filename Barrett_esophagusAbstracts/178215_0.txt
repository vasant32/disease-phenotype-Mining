Two children have been found to have partially obstructing lesions beyond the esophagus in association with mid-esophageal stricture. Both were found to have columnar epithelium-lined (Barrett) esophagus, and gastro-esophageal reflux. The more distal obstruction, in the pylorus and descending duodenum respectively, may have contributed to the development of the Barrett esophagus. It is recommended that any barium study of the esophagus which reveals an unexplained stricture should include visualization through the duodenojejunal junction as an aid to diagnosis, management, and understanding.
