BACKGROUND: Heterotopic gastric-type mucosa occurs as a flat island or islands of red mucosa in the proximal third of the esophagus where it gives rise to the "cervical inlet patch" (CIP). The aim of the present study was to delineate the clinical epidemiology of the CIP, especially its possible relationship to Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: A case-control study compared 53 case subjects with CIP and 4882 control subjects without CIP. In a multivariate logistic regression, the presence of CIP was chosen as the outcome variable, whereas demographic characteristics, social habits, and presence of other endoscopic diagnoses served as predictor variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of CIP was 1.1%. Its presence was associated with hiatal hernia (odds ratio 2.26: 95% CI [1.12, 4.56]) gastric ulcer (2.93: 95% CI [1.34, 6.40]) and Barrett's esophagus (4.41: 95% CI [2.31, 8.41]). CONCLUSIONS: The coincidence of the cervical inlet patch and Barrett's esophagus could suggest a shared embryonic etiology.
