The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of Barrett's oesophagus at the University Hospital of the West Indies which serves a population predominantly of African descent. In order to maximize accession of all cases in this preliminary study, the broad definition of columnar metaplasia of the lower oesophagus was utilized. Nevertheless, of 18 cases identified in the 21-year period, 14/17 cases (82%) available for review had specialized columnar epithelium diagnostic of Barrett's oesophagus. There was male predominance 5:1, the mean age was 53.8 years and there were two associated adenocarcinomas. These data confirm the occurrence but low prevalence of Barrett's oesophagus in this population but with a disease pattern that is consistent with that reported in other populations, warranting systematic evaluation of the gastro-oesophageal junction even in a Caribbean population.
