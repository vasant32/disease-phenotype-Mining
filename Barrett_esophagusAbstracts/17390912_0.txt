Gastroduodenal endoscopy is the most commonly accepted method to evaluate the upper gastrointestinal tract. Many surgeons have become familiar with colonoscopy, but few seem to do upper endoscopy. The introduction of the ultraslim endoscope makes office unsedated endoscopy possible. The recent suggestion of more aggressive evaluation of dyspepsia in the screening for Barrett's esophagus suggests this procedure to be both practical and necessary. This procedure is of value to all surgeons, particularly those who are called on to evaluate, treat, and operate on upper gastrointestinal disease.
