A 47-yr-old male underwent a right upper lobectomy for stage IIB bronchoalveolar carcinoma followed by 4600 Gy of irradiation. One year later a fistula formed from an ulcerated region of Barrett's esophagus into the left main bronchus. Bronchotomy repair with onlay patch intercostal muscle flap and esophageal repair with serratus anterior muscle flap plus postoperative esophageal stent placement for stricture resulted in good functional results.
