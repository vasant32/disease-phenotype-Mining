Barrett's esophagus (BE) is associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, and the recommended guideline for detection of neoplasia is surveillance endoscopy with random four-quadrant biopsies. Recently, a novel technique, confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), has emerged and enabled the endoscopist to perform a real-time histologic assessment of the gastrointestinal tract. We aimed to assess the accuracy of CLE in diagnosing BE-associated neoplasia by pooling data of existing trials. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Science Citation Index and momentous meeting abstracts were searched and evaluated by two reviewers independently. Meta-analysis was performed. Pooling data were conducted in a fixed effect model or a random effects model. Eight studies involving 709 patients and 4008 specimens were analyzed. In a per-patient analysis, the pooled sensitivity of CLE for detection of neoplasia was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.95), and the specificity was 75% (95% CI, 0.69-0.81). The area under the curve under the summary receiver operating characteristic was 0.9472. In a per-location analysis, the pooled sensitivity of CLE for detection of neoplasia was 70% (95% CI, 0.65-0.74), and the specificity was 91% (95% CI, 0.90-0.92). The area under the curve under the summary receiver operating characteristic was 0.9509. CLE is a reasonable, promising modality for management of patients with BE; more prospective trials need doing to determine whether it is superior to traditional method in diagnosing BE-associated neoplasia.
