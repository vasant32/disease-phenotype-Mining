 INTRODUCTION: For patients with esophageal carcinoma limited to the mucosa endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is the therapy of choice whereas surgical resection is advocated for submucosal tumors. METHODS: This study analyzes the histopathologic results of patients with early esophageal carcinoma who underwent EMR prior to transthoracic esophagectomy. Sixteen patients with early esophageal carcinoma and EMR as first line treatment were included in this retrospective study. Ten patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy because of submucosal infiltration combined incomplete tumor resection at the lateral/basal resection margin. In one patient each, surgical therapy was indicated due to submucosal infiltration or incomplete resection only. Three patients underwent surgical resection due to residual neoplasia within an esophageal stenosis following EMR. Surgical specimens were examined for pT and pN stage according to the UICC. RESULTS: Three patients had a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 13 patients an adenocarcinoma (AC), nine patients with a long segment Barrett's esophagus. The distribution of the pT stages was as follows: 6x pT0 (no histopathologic evidence of residual tumor), 1x pT1m1, 1x pT1m2, 3x pT1m3, 1x pT1sm1, 1x pT1sm2, 1x pT2, and 2x pT3. Three of 16 patients (18.8%) with a pT1sm1, pT2, and pT3 stage had nodal metastases. In all three patients metastatic nodes were located in the mediastinum. In two patients, a second carcinoma was detected during histopathologic work-up (1x AC in the cardia and 1x SCC in the cervical esophagus). CONCLUSION: The data of this highly selected patients indicate that the boundary between the therapy of mucosal and submucosal tumors is not as clear as stated. Therefore, treatment of early esophageal carcinoma demands a close interdisciplinary cooperation.
