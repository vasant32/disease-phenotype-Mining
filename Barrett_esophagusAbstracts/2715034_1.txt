One hundred and ten patients with Barrett's esophagus were operated on between 1963 and 1986. Preoperative endoscopy showed active peptic disease in 94% of the cases and a stenosis or ulcer in 61%. An anti-reflux operation was performed in 102 cases and a resection in 8 cases. Operative mortality was 3.6% and the morbidity was 9%. After an average follow-up of 6.9 years, 83% of the patients were satisfied with their operation. Postoperative endoscopy was performed in 39 patients after an average of 5.4 years. No progression or regression of the columnar epithelium was found. Two patients developed an adenocarcinoma in spite of adequate reflux control.
