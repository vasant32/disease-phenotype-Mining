A 50-year-old Japanese female with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, CREST syndrome) is reported. During treatment for PSS, she was diagnosed by clinical and laboratory findings as having sarcoidosis, which was confirmed by histological examination of the skin and lymph nodes in July of 1991. She complained of back pain in August of 1991. Reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus, found by endoscopy, progressed into a well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. This is a very rare case of PSS associated with sarcoidosis and esophageal adenocarcinoma developing from Barrett's esophagus.
