The experiences with endoscopic examinations of 140 patients with gastroesophageal reflux followed by the development of reflux-esophagitis (RE) of different degree are presented. The authors describe the complicated and uncomplicated forms of RE. The uncomplicated forms include RE with unimpaired integrity of the epithelium, erosive RE, erosive-ulcerous RE. The complicated forms include peptic ulcer of the esophagus, peptic stricture and Barrett esophagus. The degree of RE was found to depend on the character and degree of impairment of the obturating function of the cardia. The morphological examination of the esophagus mucosa was performed in 35 patients. Morphological heterogeneity of the so called "catarrhal RE" was shown that makes the expedience of using this term in clinical practice doubtful. Exact endoscopic and morphological criteria of the differential diagnostics of erosive and erosive-ulcerous RE, erosive-ulcerous RE and peptic ulcer of the esophagus are described.
