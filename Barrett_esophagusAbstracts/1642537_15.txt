Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is no longer rare and is treated by resection. To determine whether the approach used for resection influences outcome, we studied 88 patients who underwent resection; 14 had stage I or II disease, 74 had stage III, and 40 had stage IV. One third of those with Barrett's esophagus were noted on screening endoscopy to have potentially curable disease; the others were diagnosed with stage III or IV disease. Transhiatal esophagectomy was performed in 63 patients; 24 patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy. We found no difference in survival or morbidity between transhiatal and transthoracic esophagectomy. Overall 5-year survival for stage I and II disease was 86%. For stage III and IV disease, 5-year survival was 14.5%. Aggressive surveillance of Barrett's esophagus facilitates the discovery of early disease. Esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma can result in cure of early cancers and improved palliation of more advanced disease.
