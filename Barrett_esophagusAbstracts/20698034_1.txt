About 10%-15% of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease develop Barrett's esophagus. This is considered a premalignant condition because it can progress from metaplasia to high-grade dysplasia, and eventually to adenocarcinoma. Recently, major advances have been made in the endoscopic treatment of Barrett's esophagus, therefore limiting the role of surgery in the treatment of this disease.
