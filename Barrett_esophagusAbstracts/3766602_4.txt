Acquired fistulas between the esophagus and tracheobronchial tree are usually associated with malignancy of the esophagus, lung, or trachea. Less commonly, fistulas result from trauma or inflammation involving these structures. Untreated fistulas of any cause lead to fatal complications of aspiration. Although the prognosis in cases of malignant fistula is poor, the recognition and surgical management of nonmalignant fistulas may result in cure. An acquired esophagobronchial fistula resulting from a Barrett's ulcer of the esophagus, a previously unreported cause, is described, and the differential diagnosis and treatment of nonmalignant esophagorespiratory fistulas are discussed.
