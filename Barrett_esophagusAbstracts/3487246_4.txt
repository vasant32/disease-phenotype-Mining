Twenty-seven patients from an institution for the developmentally disabled underwent endoscopy for evaluation of vomiting, regurgitation, rumination, or upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The presence of gastroesophageal reflux and Barrett's esophagus was determined retrospectively. Twenty-three patients had an IQ less than 20, 19 were nonambulatory, and 14 were taking at least one neuroleptic drug daily. Seven patients (26%) had histologically documented Barrett's esophagus of the specialized-columnar type. Two patients with Barrett's esophagus had benign esophageal strictures, but no cases of adenocarcinoma were found. There were no significant differences (p greater than 0.05) between patients with or without Barrett's esophagus in regard to symptoms, age, sex, IQ, medications, or ambulatory status. The present data suggest that Barrett's esophagus may frequently occur in developmentally disabled patients with symptoms and signs of gastroesophageal reflux.
