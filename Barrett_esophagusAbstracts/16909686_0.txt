Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are the antisecretory drugs of choice to manage GERD-related problems. The therapeutic goal in patients with non erosive reflux disease (NERD) and low-grade-GERD is to relieve symptoms, therefore PPI are given "on demand". Severe GERD requires long term treatment to heal lesions and to prevent relapses and complications. Barrett's esophagus has to be regarded as a precancerous lesion, therefore surveillance strategy is required. Functional dyspepsia is a common reason for upper gastrointestinal symptoms. If there are no alarming symptoms, you can omit endoscopy in younger patients. The treatment is empirical and symptom driven. Psychologic therapy is a promising avenue in some patients.
