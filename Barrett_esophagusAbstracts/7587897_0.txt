In order to investigate the expression of AgNOR and PCNA in malignant Barrett's esophagus and benign Barrett's esophagus with or without dysplasia, 50 specimens and biopsies were examined using silver-staining and immunohistochemical methods. The results showed that the expression of AgNOR and PCNA in malignant Barrett's esophagus were higher than those in benign Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia, which were in turn higher than those in benign Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia. The difference between malignant group and other groups was significant. The results suggest that AgNOR and PCNA may be useful as an adjunct in screening patients with Barrett's esophagus for early malignant change, especially in high-grade dysplasia group.
