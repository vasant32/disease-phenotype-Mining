 AIM: Barrett's esophagus (BE) with specialized intestinal metaplasia (SIM) is at high risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Magnified endoscopy with narrow band imaging (ME-NBI) can be useful for detecting this condition. In addition to pit patterns, light blue crests (LBC), blue-whitish patchy areas on the metaplastic epithelia of the stomach, can predict SIM in BE under ME-NBI observation. METHODS: A total of 54 patients with BE underwent ME-NBI to identify IM pits (tubular and villous pits) and LBC. Biopsy samples were taken for histological evaluation of IM, immunohistochemical staining for CD10, MUC2 and MUC5AC antigen, transmission electron microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of CD10 mRNA expression. RESULTS: IM pit pattern with ME-NBI for the diagnosis of IM yielded acceptable sensitivity, specificity and accuracy at 92%, 77% and 83%, respectively. However, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of LBC with ME-NBI for IM were comparably high at 79%, 97% and 89%, respectively. Upon immunohistochemistry, all 19 metaplastic epithelia of LBC-positive BE showed immunoreactivity against anti-MUC2 antibody, whereas CD10 antigen was identified in 11 of the 19 LBC-positive BE. Brush borders were seen on IM epithelia using electron microscopy. On real-time PCR analysis, CD10 mRNA levels in the LBC-positive BE were higher compared to those in the LBC-negative BE. CONCLUSION: The appearance of LBC can be an accurate sign to predict SIM in BE and may be associated with high CD10 expression, possibly along with brush borders.
