Detection of microscopic and biochemical changes within the mucosa and submucosa are beyond the realm of routine endoscopy. Distinguishing hyperplastic from neoplastic polyps, differentiating malignant from benign ulcers, and detecting mucosal dysplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis or Barrett's esophagus remain within the purview of the gastrointestinal pathologist. Recent developments in tissue spectroscopy and endoscopic optical coherence tomography have the potential to expand significantly our ability to diagnose gastrointestinal disease beyond the capabilities of visible light endoscopy.
