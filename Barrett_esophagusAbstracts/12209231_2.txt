Benign esophageal stricture is a serious complication of persistent gastroesophageal reflux in patients with esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus. A classification of the severity of the stricture is proposed, based on its internal diameter, its length, and the ease or difficulty in dilating it. Among 185 patients with esophageal strictures secondary to reflux esophagitis, 77 (41.6%) corresponded to type I or mild stricture, 73 (39.4%) to type II or moderate, and 35 (19.6%) to type III. Medical treatment was performed in only 15 cases, with 73% recurrence. Three types of surgical procedures were employed, always after dilatation, improvement of nutritional status, and a complete preoperative work-up: (1) conservative antireflux surgery, which had a high incidence of recurrence (41.1%); (2) acid suppression and duodenal diversion, in which 68 patients had a mortality rate of 2.9% and a recurrence rate of 4.4% (p <0.002); and (3) esophageal resection, which in 7 patients resulted in 1 death and no late recurrence. It is concluded that classification of the severity of the stricture is important to indicate the most appropriate treatment. Conservative antireflux surgery is followed by a high recurrence rate at late follow-up, whereas acid suppression and duodenal diversion seem to be an adequate procedure that is followed by a very low recurrence rate. Esophageal resection is indicated only for patients with severe or critical esophageal strictures.
