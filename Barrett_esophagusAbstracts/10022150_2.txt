PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to review the need for regular endoscopic biopsy of Barrett's esophagus in children. METHODS: This was a retrospective case-notes review of 38 children with Barrett's esophagus treated between January 1982 and August 1997. The mean age at diagnosis was 6.3 years (range, 1 to 15 years). All had gastroesophageal reflux at diagnosis. Two patients were treated medically, and 36 underwent antireflux surgery (32 Nissen fundoplication, four Thal procedures). At follow-up, for a mean of 43 months (range, 0 to 13 years), 25 underwent repeated endoscopy and biopsies, two underwent further surgery and biopsies, and four underwent endoscopy only. Seven have had follow-up at their referring hospital. RESULTS: In the 27 patients who underwent rebiopsy, there was continued evidence of Barrett's esophagus in 15. There was reversion to normal tissue in 10 patients, and mild esophagitis was present in two. There was no evidence of any dysplastic or malignant change in any patient. All cases that reverted to normal esophagus or mild esophagitis had previously undergone a Nissen fundoplication. CONCLUSIONS: Dysplastic degeneration and malignant change did not occur in any of the authors' patients. In addition, 12 patients with Barrett's esophagus reverted to normal. The authors therefore question whether regular endoscopic surveillance is necessary in children under 16 years of age.
