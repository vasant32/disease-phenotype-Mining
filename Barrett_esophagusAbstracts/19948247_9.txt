 BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is controversy over the outcomes of esophageal adenocarcinoma with superficial submucosal invasion. We evaluated the impact of depth of submucosal invasion on the presence of metastatic lymphadenopathy and survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Pathology reports of esophagectomy samples collected from 1997 to 2007 were reviewed. Specimens from patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and submucosal invasion were reviewed and classified as superficial (upper 1 third, sm1) or deep (middle third, sm2 or deepest third, sm3) invasion. Outcomes studied were presence of metastatic lymphadenopathy and overall survival. Variables of interest were analyzed as factors that affect overall and cancer-free survival using Cox proportional hazards modeling. A multivariate model was constructed to establish independent associations with survival. RESULTS: The study included 80 patients; 31 (39%) had sm1 carcinoma, 23 (29%) had sm2 carcinoma, and 26 (33%) had sm3 carcinoma. Superficial and deep submucosal invasion were associated with substantial rates of metastatic lymphadenopathy (12.9% and 20.4%, respectively). The mean follow-up time was 40.5 +/- 4 months and the mean overall unadjusted survival time was 53.8 +/- 4.1 months. Factors significantly associated with reduced survival time included the presence of metastatic lymph nodes (hazard ratio [HR], 2.89; confidence interval [CI], 1.13-6.88) and esophageal cancer recurrence (HR 6.39, CI 2.40-16.14), but not depth of submucosal invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sm1 esophageal carcinoma have substantial rates of metastatic lymphadenopathy. Endoscopic treatment of superficial submucosal adenocarcinoma is not advised for patients that are candidates for surgery.
