 BACKGROUND: In Asia, the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease diagnosed through endoscopy has increased from 3-9% to 14-16% in the last decade. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of erosive esophagitis (EE) over a span of 10 years in a tertiary care facility in the Philippines. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with EE from 1994 to 1997 (period A) and from 2000 to 2003 (period B) were included in the study. The modified Savary-Miller and Los Angeles classifications were used to grade EE for periods A and B, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 15 981 upper endoscopies were evaluated for this study. There was no significant difference in the male: female ratio (period A 1.43:1 vs period B 1.25:1, P = 0.459) and in the mean age of patients with EE (period A 46.4 vs period B 47.5, P = 0.395). The prevalence of EE was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in period B (6.3%) as compared to period A (2.9%). However, despite a higher prevalence, more patients had mild esophagitis in period B as compared to period A. Conversely, there were more patients with esophageal ulcers (18.6%vs 5.9%, P < 0.001), esophageal strictures (2.3%vs 0%, P = 0.003), and hiatal hernia (15.8%vs 7.5%, P = 0.001) in period A. The presence of concomitant Barrett's esophagus was not significantly different between the two time periods (period A 3.2%vs period B 5%, P = 0.367). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EE was higher in 2000-2003 than in 1994-1997, although the complications associated with the disease diminished. The prevalence of concomitant Barrett's esophagus remained stable.
