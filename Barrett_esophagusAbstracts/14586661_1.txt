 BACKGROUND: Endoscopic resection has gained more and more importance in the treatment of early oesophageal neoplasia over the past few years. The choice of the different available techniques depends on the site, the macroscopic type of the tumour and the personal experience of the endoscopist. METHODS: The "suck-and-cut" technique with ligation device or cap should be favoured over normal strip biopsy in the oesophagus because of the size of the resected specimen and the technical feasibility. RESULTS: Endoscopic resection (ER) of high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia and mucosal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's oesophagus should be considered as the treatment of choice, due to excellent long-term results. First mid-term results of endoscopic therapy of early squamous cell neoplasia in the oesophagus show promising results; however, long-term results are awaited. CONCLUSION: ER of oesophageal neoplastic lesions is a safe and effective method but should be performed only by experienced endoscopists.
