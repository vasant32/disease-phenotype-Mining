BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Periodic endoscopic biopsy surveillance is recommended for selected patients with Barrett's oesophagus. A new angled swing-jaw forceps has become available which is said to facilitate tangential oesophageal biopsy sampling. We examined the size and quality of oesophageal biopsies obtained with the forceps of angled design in comparison with the large cup disposable forceps and the conventional reusable upper gastrointestinal forceps. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective comparative study, three biopsies were taken at each of three levels, using a different design of forceps at each level, in each of 48 patients undergoing endoscopic surveillance. The order in which the forceps were used was randomized. A pathologist assessed the size and quality of each set of biopsies obtained. RESULTS: The mean biopsy diameter was significantly greater at 3.00 mm with the angled forceps (P < 0.01), in comparison with 2.52 mm with the elliptical forceps and 2.07 mm with the conventional forceps. Fewer biopsies obtained with the angled forceps were graded as inadequate (8.3 %) compared with those obtained using the disposable large cup and conventional forceps (25 % and 22.9 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The design of forceps used influences the size and quality of tissue obtained during endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's oesophagus. The angled swing-jaw forceps are recommended as the most suitable for this purpose.
