 OBJECTIVE: Hiatal hernia is common in patients with Barrett's esophagus. We sought to evaluate the effect of hiatal hernia size and initial columnar segment length on the success of radiofrequency ablation of Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: A phase II clinical trial was conducted aimed at evaluating the success of radiofrequency ablation in eradicating Barrett's esophagus. Success was defined as complete replacement of the columnar lining with squamous mucosa and lack of intestinal metaplasia using light microscopy. Hiatal hernia size and columnar segment length were measured endoscopically. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were accrued to the protocol. In the 55 patients who completed radiofrequency ablation (43 successes, 12 failures), the mean hiatal hernia size was 3.3 cm (range, 0-10 cm), and the mean columnar segment length was 5.4 cm (range, 1-18 cm). The median length of the columnar segment was 3 cm in the successful cases and 8.5 cm in the failed cases (P = .002). Although the median hiatal hernia size was identical in the successful and failed cases (3 cm, P = .38), the median hiatal hernia size was 7 cm (P = .001) in the 6 patients who experienced nonhealing after the initial ablation. Patients who were successfully ablated but had larger hiatal hernias and longer columnar segment lengths required significantly more radiofrequency ablation sessions than those with smaller hernias and shorter segments (P = .003 and P = .007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with larger hiatal hernias and longer columnar segments are more likely to experience failure or nonhealing after radiofrequency ablation. These patients also require more radiofrequency ablation treatments to achieve successful eradication of Barrett's esophagus.
