BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use may protect against development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. AIM: To define the consequences of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use in patients with Barrett's oesophagus. METHODS: Records of all Barrett's oesophagus/oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients examined in Blackpool-Wyre-Fylde area were reviewed. All surviving patients completed validated questionnaires. RESULTS: Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs of any type and at any frequency was more prevalent in Barrett's oesophagus patients [147 (38%) Barrett's oesophagus vs. 30 (26%) oesophageal adenocarcinoma, P = 0.02]. Daily use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was more prevalent in Barrett's oesophagus patients [88 (23%) Barrett's oesophagus vs. 14 (12%) oesophageal adenocarcinoma, P = 0.02], due to more prevalent consumption of non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [48 (13%) Barrett's oesophagus vs. four (4%) oesophageal adenocarcinoma, P = 0.009]. There was no difference between the two groups in usage of either daily low-dose aspirin or of occasional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In logistic regression analysis any use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [odds ratio (OR) = 0571 (95% CI: 0.359-0.909), P = 0.018] and daily use of non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [OR = 0.297 (95% CI: 0.097-0.911), P = 0.034] were significant protective factors. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use did not affect the survival of oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's oesophagus consuming non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs did not differ in upper gastrointestinal bleeding [26 (15%) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs consumers vs. 29 (9%) non-consumers, P = 0.08], oesophageal ulcers [31 (18%) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug consumers vs. 49 (15%) non-consumers, P = 0.43] or stricturing [19 (11%) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug consumers vs. 41 (13%) non-consumers, P = 0.58]. CONCLUSIONS: (i) Daily use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is more prevalent in Barrett's oesophagus than oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients, because of a more prevalent use of non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. (ii) Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in Barrett's oesophagus patients is safe if acid suppression is adequate.
