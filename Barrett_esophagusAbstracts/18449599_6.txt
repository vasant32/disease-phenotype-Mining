 BACKGROUND: The impact from the mode of operation (partial vs total fundoplication) on long-term outcome after fundoplication still is unknown, although short-term randomized studies have not shown significant differences in the efficacy of reflux control. To obtain some insight concerning the long-term results, the data of a nonrandomized cohort were analyzed using propensity score statistics. METHODS: For 134 patients who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the time until recurrence of reflux symptoms was assessed. The impact of putative prognostic factors and the mode of operation (partial vs total fundoplication) on outcome were tested for significance using univariate and multivariate statistics, including the propensity score, correcting for nonrandomized treatment groups. The follow-up period was 60 to 123 months (median, 93 months). In this study, 45 patients had a partial (Toupet) fundoplication, and 89 patients underwent a total (Nissen) fundoplication. RESULTS: The rate of recurrence after 93 months (the median follow-up interval) was 14% after Nissen and 9% after Toupet fundoplication (nonsignificant difference) as estimated according to Kaplan and Meier. Massive acid exposure to the esophagus was associated with an increased risk of recurrence for 23% of the patients with a DeMeester score of 50 or higher, but only for 9% of the patients with less severe reflux (DeMeester score <50; p < 0.05). Multiple proportional hazard regression using the propensity score did not show additional significance for the variables of age, gender, presence of a Barrett esophagus, and mode of operation. CONCLUSION: The operation method did not have a significant impact on the efficacy of laparoscopic fundoplication in a cohort during a follow-up period of 60 to 123 months (median, 93 months).
