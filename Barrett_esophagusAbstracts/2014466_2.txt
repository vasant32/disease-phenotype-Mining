Oesophageal problems are common in patients with scleroderma, but the association of primary biliary cirrhosis and scleroderma is uncommon. A Barrett's oesophagus identified in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis and scleroderma is described. The Barrett's oesophagus was probably a complication of scleroderma and resulted from low lower-oesophageal sphincter pressure and severe gastro-oesophageal reflux.
