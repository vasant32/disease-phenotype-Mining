Morphological characteristics of Barrett's oesophagus were specified in 17 patients with cancer located in the cardiac orifice of the stomach. It was found that Barrett's oesophagus patients comprise 6.7% of all the authors' observations with relevant cancer diagnosis. The oesophagus appeared different in mucosal pattern, cells of the coat, glands, the degree of glandular epithelial dysplasia. Barrett's oesophagus is suggested to play a role in the genesis of cardiac gastric cancer whose malignant potential is the highest when oesophageal glands are cardiac. Applicability of the findings in general and in particular in clinical practice for deciding on the level of oesophageal resection in patients with cardiac gastric cancer is discussed.
