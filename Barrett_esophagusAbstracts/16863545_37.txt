 OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic therapy for early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus (BE) is evolving rapidly. Aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate safety and efficacy of stepwise radical endoscopic resection (ER) of BE containing early neoplasia. METHODS: Patients with early neoplasia (i.e., high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or early cancer) in BE < or = 5 cm, without signs of submucosal infiltration or lymph node/distant metastases, were included. Patients underwent resection sessions (cap technique after submucosal lifting) with intervals of 6 wk. RESULTS: Between January 2003 and December 2004, 39 consecutive patients were included. Therapy was discontinued in two patients due to unrelated comorbidity. Complete eradication of early neoplasia was achieved in all 37 treated patients in a median number of three sessions. Complete removal of all Barrett's mucosa was achieved in 33 (89%) patients: 4 patients (all had undergone APC [argon plasma coagulation]) were found to have small isles of Barrett's mucosa underneath neosquamous mucosa. Complications occurred in two out of 88 (2%) ER procedures: one asymptomatic perforation, one delayed bleeding. Symptomatic stenosis occurred in 10 of 39 (26%) patients and was effectively treated by endoscopic bougienage. During a median follow-up of 11 months, no patients died and none had recurrence of neoplasia or Barrett's mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Stepwise radical ER is effective for selected patients with early neoplasia in BE; provides optimal histopathological diagnosis; and may reduce recurrence rate, since all mucosa at risk is effectively removed. Use of APC should be limited to prevent buried Barrett's mucosa. Methods for prevention of stenosis should be developed.
