Esophageal cancer mortality is high and the incidence of this neoplasm is increasing. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the frequency of esophageal adenocarcinoma cases (EA) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases in two study periods (1977-1988 vs. 1989-2006). METHOD: Patients with esophageal cancer or adenocarcinoma of gastroesophageal junction (AGEJ) referred to the Nation al Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition "Salvador Zubir√°n" during 1989-2006 were included. The frequency of EA, SCC was compared with the previously reported series of our institute during 1977-1988. Risk factors for esophageal cancer and AGEJ were investigated. RESULTS: From 1989 to 2006 82 patients were studied, 23 with SCC, 29 with EA and 29 with AGEJ. There was a significant association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and EA (OR = 9.5; CI 95% 1.9-48.5, P = 0.0025), and also between GERD and AGEJ (OR 5.6; CI 95% 1.07-28.8, P = 0.03). The association between Barrett's esophagus and EA (OR 14; CI 95% 1.65-119.2, P = 0.0035) and for GEJC (RM 13.6; IC 95% 1.6-116, P = 0.004) was significant. There was an increase in the frequency of AE from 11% (6/57) in the first period to 56% (29/52) in the second period (P < 0.001). The rela tion SCC/EA change from 7:1 in the first period to 0.8:1 in the second. CONCLUSION: There has been an increase in EA, being now the predominant hystologic type of esophageal cancer.
