Twenty-six patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) were followed prospectively by endoscopic examination and biopsy. Two biopsies were taken from each of 4 areas of BE. One was processed for light microscopy (LM) and one for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Those in whom dysplastic BE was demonstrated by LM were reexamined at 6-mo intervals, and the others at yearly intervals. One patient had low grade dysplasia (LGD) by LM on entry, and in 2 others, LGD was recognized on the second examination. These changes have persisted in semiannual examinations over 3, 2, and 2 yr, respectively. SEM prints were examined without knowledge of LM findings, and features that might correlate with LGD by LM were sought. SEM findings were similar to those of Zwas et al. (Gastroenterology 90:1932, 1986) in that most glandular cells had surface features unlike either gastric or intestinal cells but unique to BE. In the patient with LGD on entry, there was an aggregate of very large cells covered by short microvilli with bald patches. In the other patients with LGD, there was more variation in size and shape of cells than in nondysplastic cases.
