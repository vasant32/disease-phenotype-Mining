A two-part retrospective study was conducted to assess the value of a reticular pattern as a sign of columnar-lined esophagus. Radiographic, endoscopic, and histologic findings were reviewed in 124 patients with known Barrett esophagus; then all barium esophagrams done at our institution during a 3 1/2 month period were reviewed and presence of a reticular pattern was correlated with available endoscopic and histologic data. In patients with known Barrett esophagus, the reticular pattern was found in 26% of double-contrast examinations. Twelve of these patients underwent careful esophageal mapping biopsies: the pattern was in squamous mucosa with ulceration in two, in columnar epithelium with ulceration in six, and in columnar epithelium without ulceration in four. In the group of 314 unselected patients who had double-contrast examinations, the reticular pattern was found in 26 (8%). Thirteen of the 26 had had endoscopy and biopsy: the site of the pattern was located in a squamous carcinoma in one, in squamous epithelium adjacent to squamous carcinoma in three, in squamous epithelium with esophagitis in five (two of whom had columnar mucosa distally), in normal squamous mucosa in one, and in columnar epithelium with esophagitis in three. The reticular pattern is a strong indicator of important esophageal disease, but is not specific for Barrett esophagus.
