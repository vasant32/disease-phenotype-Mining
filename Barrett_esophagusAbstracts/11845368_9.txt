Barrett's oesophagus is a premalignant condition in which stratified squamous type mucosa of the normal oesophagus is replaced by specialised intestinal type columnar mucosa. Oesophageal resection was previously considered to be the treatment of choice for high-grade dysplasia or superficial carcinoma arising in this columnar-lined mucosa. We treated four patients with Barrett's oesophagus and high-grade dysplasia, and one patient with superficial oesophageal carcinoma with photodynamic therapy (PDT) using an argon-pumped dye laser light (652 nm). PDT was also delivered using a xenon arc lamp (Paterson lamp, light 652 nm +/- 15 nm) in two patients with Barrett's oesophagus and high-grade dysplasia. mTHPC (m-tetrahydroxyphenyl chlorin) 0.15 mg/kg was used as a photosensitiser in all the patients. We have been able to demonstrate the elimination of columnar-lined oesophageal mucosa, reduction in the length of the Barrett's segment or downgrading of the dysplasia in all of the patients. There is no evidence of recurrence in the patient who had oesophageal carcinoma, at 27 months follow-up. We conclude that mTHPC is useful as a photosensitiser for PDT in the management of Barrett's oesophagus with high-grade dysplasia or superficial carcinoma and the Paterson lamp is a potential alternative light source for PDT.
