It is clear that CP is present in a higher or lower degree in different gastric-duodenum pathologies, especially in active superficial chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer and duodenum ulcer with gastric metaplasia. It is also found in atrophic chronic gastritis and, to a lesser extent, if it has intestinal metaplasia, as well as in some normal stomachs. It is not found in a histologically normal duodenum, nor in the oesophagus. As the fact that there was no publication on BE drew our attention, we set to make a retrospective research of CP of spinal metaplasia of distal oesophagus. Its presence proved to be high, 88% even in those cases with intestinal metaplasia and with ulcer of Barrett. We have used Gram coloration and Warthin Starry with Alcian-Blue and we have classified it within the degrees set by Marshall and Warren. We have also carried out a discussion on certain physiopathological facts, such as the presence of infiltrated PMN in all the cases, and its importance in keeping metaplasia, of ulcers of Barrett and its possible role in the development of adenocarcinoma.
