A surgically placed jejunostomy tube is a safe and effective means of delivering nutritional support for the postesophagogastrectomy patient. We have previously described a method that permits percutaneous replacement of surgically placed jejunostomy feeding tubes, and now present our results with the use of this technique in 350 consecutive esophagogastrectomy patients. Replacement jejunostomy as required in 17 patients (4.9%). All patients had successful percutaneous jejunostomy replacement. There were no procedural complications or deaths. The timing of feeding tube replacement following esophagogastrectomy was predictive of the indication. Before 16 weeks, the indication for feeding tube replacement was intubation and inability to eat (1 patient) or anorexia with weight loss and dehydration (7 patients). At or after 16 weeks, the indications for feeding tube replacement were all related to symptoms resulting from recurrent carcinoma. We conclude that the technique of percutaneous jejunostomy allows the surgeon tremendous flexibility in the management of the postesophagogastrectomy patient as it preserves the advantages of an adjuvant surgically placed feeding tube over the lifetime of the patient. The technique is safe, and the success rate is excellent.
