Gastroesophageal reflux is a condition that causes lung complications by gastric content aspiration in both adults and children. The most common complications are asthma, chronic bronchitis or chronic cough, recurrent pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis and in children apnea as a result of regurgitation of large amount of gastric content suddenly. The reason of recurrent aspiration pneumonia is the aspiration of gastric content or microorganisms in upper gastrointestinal system. Barrett's esophagus characterized by the conversion of the epithelium of esophagus from squamous to columnar is a histological consequence of gastroesophageal reflux. We are presenting a case of Barrett's esophagus and recurrent pneumonia who had respiratory symptoms and difficulty in swallowing but no symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. As it has been shown in our case it is difficult to cure the respiratory disease caused by nontreated asymptomatic gastroesophageal reflux.
