 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of c-myb in reflux esophagitis, Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The expression levels of c-myb in the esophageal mucosa tissue of patients with reflux esophagitis, Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: The expression levels of c-myb mRNA in Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that in normal and reflux esophagitis esophageal tissue (P<0.05 or 0.01), and increased progressively with the development of reflux esophagitis into Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The expression level of c-myb mRNA is closely related with the development of Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, and may be used as a valuable index for monitoring the early onset and intervention of Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma.
