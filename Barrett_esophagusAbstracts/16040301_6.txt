Overexpression of decoy receptor (DcR) 3 protein, a recently discovered member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, was examined in 40 esophagogastrectomy specimens containing areas of Barrett esophagus (n = 27), low-grade dysplasia (n = 27), high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma in situ (n = 22), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC; n = 28) with immunohistochemical analysis. The results revealed significantly more overexpression of DcR3 in high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma in situ and EAC than in benign esophageal mucosa (both P < .0001), Barrett esophagus (both P < .001), and low-grade dysplasia (P < .01 and P = .033, respectively). Low-grade dysplasia also showed significant overexpression of DcR3 compared with benign esophagus (P < .05) but not with Barrett esophagus (P > .05). DcR3 overexpression seems to negatively correlate with the grade of EAC. Our results suggest that overexpression of DcR3 protein might aid in the diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma in situ and EAC and also might serve as a potential therapeutic target.
