Our purpose was to evaluate the relationship between the clinical and histological features in a cohort of patients who had gastroesophageal reflux-related lesions diagnosed after upper digestive endoscopy. In all, 589 patients scheduled for elective endoscopy in a multicentric prospective study were evaluated. Multiple biopsies from the distal esophagus showing aspects of esophagitis or metaplastic epithelium were taken. Esophagitis was histologically detected in 25.6%, gastric-type Barrett's esophagus in 36.2%, and specialized columnar epithelium in 33.1%. The frequency of esophagitis was constant across age decades. Patients with specialized columnar epithelium were significantly older (P = 0.01) and had a greater extent of metaplastic epithelium (P<0.0001). Specialized columnar epithelium was observed in 15% of patients with only distal esophagitis. In conclusion, endoscopic esophagitis was constant across age strata. The presence of specialized columnar epithelium was associated with older age and with longer segments of Barrett's esophagus. Short areas of esophagitis should be biopsied in view of their potential for holding areas of specialized columnar epithelium.
