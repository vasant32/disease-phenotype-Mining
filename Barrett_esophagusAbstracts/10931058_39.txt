BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of invasive cancer in patients with high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's oesophagus and to verify whether a second endoscopy with multiple biopsies could improve the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis. In addition, the mortality, morbidity and survival rates in patients with high-grade dysplasia having oesophageal resection were recorded. METHODS: Fifteen patients were observed from 1982 to 1998; the first seven patients were offered primary oesophageal resection after diagnosis. The other eight patients underwent a second endoscopy with a median of 12 biopsies examined. All later underwent oesophageal resection. RESULTS: Invasive adenocarcinoma was found in five patients, with a minimal difference between the first and second periods (two of seven versus three of eight). There were no perioperative deaths. Early morbidity was observed in eight patients and late morbidity in four. The actuarial survival rate was 79 per cent at 5 years. The Karnofsky status was unchanged from preoperative values in 13 of 15 patients after a median follow-up of 46 months. CONCLUSION: These patients with high-grade dysplasia had a 33 per cent probability of harbouring invasive oesophageal carcinoma but even a second endoscopy failed to identify patients with invasive tumour. Oesophagectomy was performed with no deaths and remains a rational treatment in patients fit for surgery.
