STUDY AIM: The aim of this study was to report the results of a retrospective series of 26 patients with Barrett's esophagus treated by antireflux surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1979 to 1998, 21 men and five women (mean age: 53 years) with histologically proven Barrett's esophagus underwent an antireflux procedure. The mean length of Barrett's epithelium was 5.9 cm for 19 patients (73.1%). Six patients (23.1%) had tongue lesions of Barrett's epithelium, and one (3.8%) had ectopic gastric mucosa. None of the patients had a preoperative esophageal biopsy that revealed high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma. Laparotomy was performed in 17 cases and laparoscopy in nine cases. Preoperative endoscopic local treatment with argon coagulation was performed in one patient. RESULTS: Clinical mean follow-up was 78 months and endoscopic mean follow-up was 59.3 months. No increase in the length of the Barrett's epithelium was observed. Seven patients (27%) had complete or partial regression (among them three patients with tongue lesions and one patient preoperatively treated by argon). No patients developed high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Regression of Barrett's esophagus is possible but not frequent and unpredictable after antireflux procedure. However, endoscopic and histological surveillance should be continued postoperatively.
