We report a case of a granular cell tumor colliding with intramucosal adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. A 58-year-old white was found to have a 5 mm nodule in the distal esophagus detected by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed as part of the workup of long standing reflux. Endoscopic biopsies revealed intramucosal adenocarcinoma arising in the setting of Barrett's esophagus. The adenocarcinoma infiltrated a granular cell tumor also present at the nodular site. Endoscopic mucosal resection using Duette band ligation and hot snare electrocautery was performed. Margins were negative for both tumors, and endoscopic surveillance for recurrence is planned.
