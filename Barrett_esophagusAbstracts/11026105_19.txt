Our aim was to characterize expression and mutation of beta-catenin in the progression of Barrett esophagus to adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of beta-catenin was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue from 30 cases with adenocarcinomas and premalignant lesions. To determine whether there is a correlation between beta-catenin nuclear accumulation and exon 3 mutation of this gene, mutational analysis by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism was performed on DNA extracted from the same 30 adenocarcinomas. As a result, the prevalence of reduced expression of beta-catenin on the membrane, with or without nuclear staining, increased significantly from low-grade (LG) to high-grade (HG) dysplasia. Focal nuclear staining for beta-catenin was present in 19 cases of adenocarcinoma, and nuclear staining was associated significantly with progression from metaplasia to LG dysplasia. In addition, in glands with clear histologic transition from metaplasia to LG dysplasia, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was found only in the LG dysplastic areas. No mutation in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene was detected in adenocarcinomas. These results demonstrate that disturbance of the APC/beta-catenin pathway, as indicated by nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, is a common and early event during neoplastic progression in Barrett esophagus.
