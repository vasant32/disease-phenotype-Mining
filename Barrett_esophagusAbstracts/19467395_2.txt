 INTRODUCTION: Otolaryngologists implement transnasal esophagoscopy (TNE) to assess esophageal pathology. Previous studies using TNE are largely retrospective and deal with select patient populations. The prevalence of esophageal pathology in patients presenting with throat symptoms to an otolaryngology voice center is presently unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of esophageal pathology in this population and determine the interobserver variability of the findings reviewed by an otolaryngologist and a gastroenterologist. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: This study was conducted in a laryngology/voice subspecialty clinic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with throat symptoms presenting to the voice center were asked prospectively to undergo TNE. The findings were videotaped and reviewed by an otolaryngologist and a gastroenterologist blinded to the patients' presenting complaint. RESULTS: Hoarseness was the most common presenting symptom (68%). According to the gastroenterologist, the prevalence of esophageal findings was: z-line irregularity suspicious for Barrett esophagus (12%), esophagitis (10%), hiatal hernia (32%), and esophageal stricture (10%). The percent agreement for a normal study was 72 percent. The percent agreement for various pathological findings were as follows: Barrett esophagus 86 percent, esophagitis 88 percent, hiatal hernia 76 percent, and esophageal stricture 96 percent. For an abnormal study, the percent agreement was 80 percent. CONCLUSION: Esophageal abnormalities are common in patients presenting to a voice subspecialty clinic.
