It is often difficult to accurately delineate the borders and extent of early-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett's esophagus using conventional white light endoscopy. Chromoendoscopy enhances the characteristics of the mucosa and improves detection and delineation of small or flat lesions difficult to identify by conventional endoscopy. Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (NBI) is a novel endoscopic imaging technology that contrasts the vascular architecture and surface structure of the superficial mucosa. As magnifying NBI can view only a narrow area of the mucosa, this method cannot determine the circumference of the lesion and evaluate its complete extent. Indigocarmine chromoendoscopy is useful for delineating the extent of Barrett's adenocarcinoma. Chromoendoscopy and magnifying NBI are complementary methods, with both being required for the accurate diagnosis of tumor extent in patients with superficial Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma.
