BACKGROUND: Biopsy specimens obtained from the gastro-oesophageal junction can reveal intestinal metaplasia in patients presenting for routine upper endoscopy. The site of biopsy may play a critical role in determining the dysplasia risk of a patient. AIMS: To evaluate prospectively the dysplasia risk in patients with intestinal metaplasia of the distal oesophagus or within the gastric cardia. METHODS: Patients with short segment Barrett's oesophagus (SSBO) and cardia intestinal metaplasia (CIM) were followed prospectively. RESULTS: 177 patients with SSBO were identified (mean age 62 years, range 38-82; 91% whites). Twenty prevalence cases of dysplasia in SSBO were detected: 17 low grade dysplasia (LGD), three high grade dysplasia (HGD). Seventy six patients with CIM were identified (mean age 67 years, range 37-81; 81% whites). A single prevalence case of LGD in CIM was detected. During follow up of 78 SSBO and 34 CIM patients, dysplasia developed in nine (seven LGD, two HGD) with SSBO and in one (LGD) with CIM. There were significant differences between the two groups with respect to age, ethnicity, dysplasia prevalence, and incidence. Time to dysplasia progression was significantly longer in CIM compared with SSBO patients. Of the five patients with SSBO and HGD, one developed adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus on follow up. No HGD or cancers have been detected over this time period in CIM patients. CONCLUSIONS: The dysplasia risk is significantly greater in SSBO than in CIM patients, indicating two potentially different clinical processes. Future studies should separate SSBO from CIM in order to enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology and malignant potential of each entity.
