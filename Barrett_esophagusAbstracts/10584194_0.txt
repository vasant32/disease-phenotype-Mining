There have been few reports of Barrett's esophagus associated with chemotherapy in children. We report the case of a 3-year-old patient diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed Barrett's esophagus after BMF-90 chemotherapeutic regimen. A stricture appeared as a complication of Barrett's metaplasia and Nissen fundoplication was performed. Symptoms improved shortly after surgery and regression of Barrett's esophagus was observed 2 years later. Children treated with antileukemic chemotherapy may develop Barrett's esophagus without previous clinical apparent gastroesophageal reflux. Endoscopic surveillance has been advised in these patients. Barrett's esophagus may regress after antireflux surgery.
