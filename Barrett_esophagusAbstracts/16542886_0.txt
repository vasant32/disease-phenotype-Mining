BACKGROUND: Pit pattern diagnosis is important for endoscopic detection of dysplastic Barrett's lesions, though using magnification endoscopy can be difficult and laborious. We investigated the usefulness of a modified crystal violet chromoendoscopy procedure and utilised a new pit pattern classification for diagnosis of dysplastic Barrett's lesions. METHODS: A total of 1,030 patients suspected of having a columnar lined oesophagus were examined, of whom 816 demonstrated a crystal violet-stained columnar lined oesophagus. The early group of patients underwent 0.05% crystal violet chromoendoscopy, while the later group was examined using 0.03% crystal violet with 3.0% acetate. A targeted biopsy of the columnar lined oesophagus was performed using crystal violet staining after making a diagnosis of closed or open type pit pattern with a newly proposed system of classification. The relationship between type of pit pattern and histologically identified dysplastic Barrett's lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: Dysplastic Barrett's lesions were identified in biopsy samples with an open type pit pattern with a sensitivity of 96.0%. Further, Barrett's mucosa with the intestinal predominant mucin phenotype was closely associated with the open type pit pattern (sensitivity 81.9%, specificity 95.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The new pit pattern classification for diagnosis of Barrett's mucosa was found to be useful for identification of cases with dysplastic lesions and possible malignant potential using a crystal violet chromoendoscopic procedure.
