 RATIONALE: Reflux of gastric and duodenal contents in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been postulated as a major cause of complications, such as Barrett's esophagus or malignant degeneration. FINDINGS: We present a summary of experimental, clinical, and immunohistochemical studies that show that acid and bile reflux are increased in patients who suffer from GERD, are the key factor in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus, and are possibly related to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
