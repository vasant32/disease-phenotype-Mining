Two sisters presenting with Barrett's oesophagus both at the age of 66, are described. The endoscopic appearances revealed striking similarities in terms of severity and extent of the lesion and the presence of a hiatus hernia. At oesophageal manometry low lower oesophageal sphincter pressures were recorded in each case. These observations raise the possibility that familial factors may influence the development of this condition, and likely mechanisms are discussed.
