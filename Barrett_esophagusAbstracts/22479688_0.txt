Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma (BAC) is a cancer associated with heartburn. If gastroesophageal reflux is not treated, the exposure to acid over the years, leads to a premalignant condition known as Barrett's esophagus (BE) which then progresses through low grade and high grade dysplasias to Barrett's adenocarcinoma. Genomic instability, which seems to arise early at BE stage, leads to accrual of mutational changes which underlie the the succession of histological and physiological changes associated with this disease. Genomic instability is therefore an important target for prevention and treatment of cancer and it is important to elucidate the mechanisms associated with this problem. We have shown that elevated/deregulated homologous recombination mediates genomic instability in cancer. Recently we also demonstrated that the mutational rates of individual chromosomes in BAC cells correlate with their ALU frequency. The aims of this article are to briefly discuss different types of repetitive sequences and highlight their importance in physiology of normal and cancer cells, especially BAC.
