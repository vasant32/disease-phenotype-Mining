At the close of the 20th century, therapeutic endoscopy in the esophagus has expanded to encompass a broad array of interventions. As the number of procedures grows, emphasis in the medical literature has begun to shift to analyses of which procedures should be performed. Many studies published in 1999 on topics ranging from endoscopic treatment of benign and malignant strictures, to variceal bleeding, to Barrett esophagus have focused on which of several methods provides the best long-term response with the fewest interventions. This is a review of the major published studies of endoscopic interventions in the esophagus as well as selected abstracts. The conclusions of these studies and reports of new endoscopic therapies draw a clear map of where nonoperative esophageal therapeutics are headed in the next several years.
