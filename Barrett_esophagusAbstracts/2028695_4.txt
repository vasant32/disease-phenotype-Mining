The cytologic findings in 13 endoscopic brushing specimens from biopsy-proven premalignant glandular lesions (PGLs) of the upper gastrointestinal tract were reviewed retrospectively. The specimens were from ten patients: three with dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, four with gastric adenomas and three with duodenal adenomas. One dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus and four adenomas (two gastric and two duodenal) had coexisting adenocarcinomas. Most pure PGLs were characterized cytologically by cohesive three-dimensional clusters of cells with more-or-less uniformly enlarged nuclei and an increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. Crowding and molding were present within these clusters; however, the cells were arranged in a somewhat orderly or palisading fashion, instead of entirely haphazardly. In cases of carcinoma coexisting with adenoma or dysplasia, the atypical cells tended to be more pleomorphic and dyshesive. In one specimen from an adenocarcinoma arising in an adenoma, the adenomatous and carcinomatous components could be distinguished cytologically.
