 AIM: To investigate the difference of gene expression profiles between Barrett's esophagus and reflux esophagitis induced by gastroduodenoesophageal reflux in rats. METHODS: Eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were treated esophagoduodenostomy to produce gastroduodenoesophageal reflux, and another group received sham operation as control. Esophageal epithelial tissues were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately for pathology 40 wk after surgery. The expression profiles of 4 096 genes in reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus tissues were compared with normal esophageal epithelium by cDNA microarray. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-eight genes in Barrett's esophagus were more than three times different from those in normal esophageal epithelium, including 312 up-regulated and 136 down-regulated genes. Two hundred and thirty-two genes in RE were more than three times different from those in normal esophageal epithelium, 90 up-regulated and 142 down-regulated genes. Compared to reflux esophagitis, there were 214 up-regulated and 142 down-regulated genes in Barrett's esophagus. CONCLUSION: Esophageal epithelium exposed excessively to harmful ingredients of duodenal and gastric reflux can develop esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus gradually. The gene expression level is different between reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus and the differentially expressed genes might be related to the occurrence and development of Barrett's esophagus and the promotion or progression in adenocarcinoma.
