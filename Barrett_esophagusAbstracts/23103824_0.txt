 BACKGROUND & AIMS: The goal of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) is to eliminate dysplasia and metaplasia. The efficacy and safety of RFA for patients with BE and neoplasia are characterized incompletely. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 244 patients treated with RFA for BE with dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma. Efficacy outcomes were complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM), complete eradication of dysplasia, total treatments, and RFA sessions. Safety outcomes included death, perforation, stricture, bleeding, and hospitalization. We identified factors associated with incomplete EIM and stricture formation. RESULTS: CEIM was achieved in 80% of patients, and complete eradication of dysplasia was achieved in 87%; disease progressed in 4 patients. A higher percentage of patients with incomplete EIM were female (40%) than those with CEIM (20%; P = .045); patients with incomplete EIM also had a longer segment of BE (5.5 vs 4.0 cm; P = .03), had incomplete healing between treatment sessions (45% vs 15%; P = 0.004), and underwent more treatment sessions (4 vs 3; P = .007). Incomplete healing was associated independently with incomplete EIM. Twenty-three patients (9.4%) had a treatment-related complication during 777 treatment sessions (3.0%), including strictures (8.2%), postprocedural hemorrhages (1.6%), and hospitalizations (1.6%). Patients who developed strictures were more likely to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs than those without strictures (70% vs 45%; P = .04), have undergone antireflux surgery (15% vs 3%; P = .04), or had erosive esophagitis (35% vs 12%; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: RFA is highly effective and safe for treatment of BE with dysplasia or early stage cancer. Strictures were the most common complications. Incomplete healing between treatment sessions was associated with incomplete EIM. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, prior antireflux surgery, and a history of erosive esophagitis predicted stricture formation.
