An 82-year-old man developed severe, acute, predominantly motor polyneuropathy, signs of autonomic involvement, and skin changes following aminolevulinic acid (ALA) administration. The compound was used as a prodrug for photodynamic therapy of Barrett's esophagitis. Changes were observed in various parameters of the heme pathway. The case reported represents a rare response to ALA treatment, resembling an acute attack of hepatic porphyria with neurological features.
