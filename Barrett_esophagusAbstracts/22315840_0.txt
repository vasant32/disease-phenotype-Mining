Although 10% to 15% of gastro-oesophageal reflex disease (GERD) patients have Barrett's oesophagus, neither the frequency nor the severity of symptoms correlates with the presence of Barrett's epithelium. Age, male sex, white race, and obesity have been implicated in some studies. The studies in Indian population reflect low prevalence rates; however, there is no study of obesity as independent risk factor for Barrett's disease in Indian population. The present study showed Barrett's oesophagus in 9.5% patients who were obese as compared to non-obese patients having Barrett's 6.7% suggesting obesity might not predispose to Barrett's oesophagus, in patients of GERD taken criterion for obesity as BMI more than 30.
