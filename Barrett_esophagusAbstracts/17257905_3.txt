 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Guidelines for reporting Barrett's esophagus and hiatal hernia measurements and reflux esophagitis grades have been developed to improve consistency, communication, and, ultimately, patient care. Our aims were to assess the percentage of cases in which findings were reported in accordance with guidelines and to assess the impact of education and feedback on reporting behavior. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study design was used. Chart reviews were performed for all adult patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy at a tertiary care center during three 2-month time periods during a 12-month interval: Time 1 (March 1, 2004-April 30, 2004), Time 2 (July 1, 2004-August 31, 2004), and Time 3 (March 1, 2005-April 30, 2005). Standardized educational sessions began 2 years before Time 1. No intervention took place between Time 1 and Time 2; data were collected to examine secular change. Between Time 2 and Time 3, individual and group feedback and refresher sessions were given. RESULTS: Five thousand six hundred nine eligible esophagogastroduodenoscopies were performed, of which 2675 demonstrated Barrett's esophagus, hiatal hernia, and/or reflux esophagitis. At baseline, Barrett's esophagus and hiatal hernia measurements were dictated correctly in a median of 67% and 86% of cases, respectively, improving to 100% (P < .05) and 98% (P < .01) of cases, respectively. The Los Angeles Classification system was used in a median of 100% of cases at baseline and at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Anonymous individual and group feedback, in combination with brief, structured didactic educational sessions, significantly improves compliance with established guidelines for the reporting of Barrett's esophagus and hiatal hernia. Once successfully incorporated into clinical practice, adherence to the esophagitis Los Angeles Classification System is easy to maintain.
