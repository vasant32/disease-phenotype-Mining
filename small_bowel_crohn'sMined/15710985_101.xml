<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this prospective study was to validate the gain in information and therapeutic impact of WCE in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty six consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> underwent computed tomography (CT) enteroclysis, and if stenoses &lt;10 mm were excluded, WCE was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 15 patients (27%), WCE could not be performed due to strictures detected by CT enteroclysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the other 41 patients, jejunal or ileal lesions were found in 25 patients by WCE compared with 12 by CT enteroclysis (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This gain in information was mainly due to detection of small mucosal lesions such as villous denudation, aphthoid ulcerations, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both methods were not significantly different in the detection of lesions in the terminal/neoterminal ileum (WCE 24 patients, CT enteroclysis 20 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therapy was changed due to WCE findings in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consecutively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them improved clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Capsule endoscopy improves the diagnosis of small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may have significant therapeutic impact </plain></SENT>
