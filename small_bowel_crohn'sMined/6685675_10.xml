<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven (21%) had low plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> concentrations (less than 1.2 mumol/l (34.3 micrograms %)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of these were outpatients and plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> was only slightly reduced (greater than 1.0 mumol/l (28.6%)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> outpatients weighed 80% or more of ideal, and were considered at low risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004905'>vitamin A deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, of the six inpatients with low plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> concentration, five had a level of less than 1.0 mumol/l (28.6 micrograms %) and weighed less than 80% ideal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of these had impaired dark adaptation and a plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> concentration of less than 0.8 mumol/l (less than 22.9 micrograms %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a group, the inpatients were more protein depleted than the outpatients, with respect to serum albumin (p less than 0.01), transferrin (p less than 0.001), and prealbumin (p less than 0.001) but <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> binding protein levels were not significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that patients with extensive small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, who weigh less than 80% of ideal weight, merit measurement of plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those with plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> less than 0.8 mumol/l (less than 22.9 micrograms %) run a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000662'>night blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vitamin supplements should be given and protein <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> corrected </plain></SENT>
