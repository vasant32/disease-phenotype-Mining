<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Calprotectin is a protein released by neutrophils in response to the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the bowel (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on secondary care data with a cut-off of 50 mcg using ELISA assay it has a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 94% (2) to exclude <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) from functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calprotectin can be measured in a stool sample with this non-invasive test significantly cheaper than endoscopy and associated new patient referral (3,4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Faecal calprotectin (FC) has also been shown to correlate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucosal disease</z:e> activity and can help to predict response to treatment or relapse in IBD (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report the routine use of FC in gastroenterology practice at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> FC tests performed between 01/07/12 and 31/12/12 were systematically collected and reason for testing determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic, histological, radiological, laboratory and clinical records were systematically searched to identify tests performed in patients with FC results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 294 FC tests were performed during the study period: 203 (69.0%) for assessment of IBD and 91 (31.0%) tests to exclude IBD in patients with suspected functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean age of patients with suspected functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disorders</z:e> was 45 (SD 16.8) years and 62.6% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> who had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FC value (n = 75), 50.7% had a colonoscopy, 20.0% had CT or MRI and 9.3% had a flexible sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 75 patients with suspected functional bowel disorder with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FC values, 2 patients were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> affecting the terminal ileum on colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> the test had a specificity of 80.2% and a negative predictive value of 97.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FC result, a significant proportion of young adults with suspected functional bowel disorder undergo colonoscopy with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As other studies have shown, consideration of the FC result before further investigations are ordered can reduce the number of patients requiring endoscopy or imaging and thus reduce cost (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, FC is less sensitive for small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and therefore careful history taking is required to ensure this is not missed due to a negative FC result </plain></SENT>
