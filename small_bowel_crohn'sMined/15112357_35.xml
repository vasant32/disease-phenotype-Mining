<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of wireless capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) of the small bowel undetected by conventional modalities, and to determine the diagnostic yield of M2A Given Capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From May 2002 to April 2003, we prospectively examined 20 patients with suspected CD by capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients had the following features: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, positive fecal occult blood test, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, diarrhoea and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results in small bowel series (SBS) and in upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy before they were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 6.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 20 patients, 13 (65%) were diagnosed as CD of the small bowel according to the findings of M2A Given Capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings detected by the capsule were mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> (2 patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthas</z:e> (5 patients), nodularity (1 patient), large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (2 patients), and ulcerated stenosis (3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the lesions was mainly in the distal part of the small bowel, and the mild degree of lesions was 54% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Wireless capsule endoscopy is effective in diagnosing patients with suspected CD undetected by conventional diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can be used to detect early lesions in the small bowel of patients with CD </plain></SENT>
