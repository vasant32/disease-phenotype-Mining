<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The typical macroscopic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> have been well described and are widely regarded as sufficient to diagnose the disease at laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report six patients undergoing laparotomy for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, shown radiologically, who were found to have macroscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> small bowel despite careful examination of the bowel by an experienced surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In four cases resection was deferred, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequently deteriorated and required further surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Minor abnormalities found by balloon examination of the terminal ileum prompted resection in two further patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histology showed an unusually superficial distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, which could explain the negative findings at laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> laparotomy findings alone do not exclude a diagnosis of clinically important small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> should be considered in patients with persisting symptoms after negative laparotomy </plain></SENT>
