<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a well established technique for imaging the small bowel, with an increasing clinical uptake and range of indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the utility of WCE, comparing the diagnostic yield of procedures by indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> WCE procedures performed at our centre, January 2007 to March 2013 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 293 procedures were performed in 279 patients, male 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age at time of procedure was 59 (IQR 45-71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indications were: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (IDA)/occult GI <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> 154 (53%), known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> requiring assessment 58 (20%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (+/- other symptoms) 33 (11%), overt GI <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> 20 (7%), isolated diarrhoea 10 (3%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> 6 (2%), isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> 4 (1%), other 8 (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those undergoing WCE for symptoms (47; 16%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was excluded (an aim of performing the study) in 34 (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median gastric transit time was 27 min (IQR 14-55), small bowel transit time 243 min (IQR 181-300) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unplanned endoscopy for failure of capsule progression was required in 8 cases (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5 procedures (2%) failed to image the small bowel (failed to leave stomach (3), battery failure (1), poor views (1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A prokinetic was used in 9% (n = 27) of procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall the diagnostic yield was 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Separating by indication, the diagnostic yield was highest for overt GI <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, 70% overall (n = 14), identifying both 9/20 small bowel causes and 5/20 in colon/upper GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Yield for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> assessment was 63%, IDA/occult GI <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> 46%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (+/- other GI symptoms) 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yield of WCE for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> in the absence of other symptoms or abnormal radiology/ileoscopy was only 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>23 out of 27 patients evaluated for symptoms (in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>/known Crohn's) were discharged requiring no further investigation following a negative result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Wireless capsule endoscopy has a good diagnostic yield, especially for evaluating GI blood loss (overt or occult) and assessing small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Among highly symptomatic patients, WCE can facilitate completion of investigatory pathways and enable discharge to primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The utility of WCE in investigating isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> appears limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
