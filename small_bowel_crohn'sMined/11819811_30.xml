<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The assessment of inflammatory activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e> in man can be done using a variety of different techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These range from the use of non-invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase inflammatory markers measured in plasma such as C reactive protein (CRP) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (both of which give an indirect assessment of disease activity) to the direct assessment of disease activity by intestinal biopsy performed during endoscopy in association with endoscopic scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both radiology and endoscopy are conventional for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However these techniques have severe limitations when it comes to assessing functional components of the disease such as activity and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we briefly review the value of two emerging intestinal function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intestinal permeability, although ideally suited for diagnostic screening for small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, appears to give reliable predictive data for imminent relapse of small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and it can be used to assess responses to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More significantly it is now clear that single stool assay of neutrophil specific proteins (calprotectin, lactoferrin) give the same quantitative data on <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> as the 4 day faecal excretion of 111Indium labelled white cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Faecal calprotectin is shown to be increased in over 95% of patients with IBD and correlates with clinical disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It reliably differentiates between patients with IBD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More importantly, at a given faecal calprotectin concentration in patients with quiescent IBD, the test has a specificity and sensitivity in excess of 85% in predicting clinical relapse of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that relapse of IBD is closely related to the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> and suggests that targeted treatment at an asymptomatic stage of the disease may be indicated </plain></SENT>
