<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The small bowel is the most commonly affected site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) although it may involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current methodologies for examining the small bowel are x ray and endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate, for the first time, the effectiveness of wireless capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected CD of the small bowel undetected by conventional modalities, and to determine the diagnostic yield of the M2A Given Capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Seventeen patients (eight males, mean age 40 (15) years) with suspected CD fulfilled study entry criteria: nine had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (mean <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> 10.5 (SD 1.8) g%), eight had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, seven had diarrhoea, and three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small bowel x ray and upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopic findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 6.3 (SD 2.2) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Each subject swallowed an M2A Given Capsule containing a miniature video camera, batteries, a transmitter, and an antenna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recording time was approximately eight hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The capsule was excreted naturally in the patient's bowel movement, and the data it contained were retrieved and interpreted the next day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 17 study participants, 12 (70.6%, six males, mean age 34.5 (12) years) were diagnosed as having CD of the small bowel according to the findings of the M2A Given Capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Wireless capsule endoscopy diagnosed CD of the small bowel (diagnostic yield of 71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated as being an effective modality for diagnosing patients with suspected CD undetected by conventional diagnostic methodologies </plain></SENT>
