<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis relies on clinical history, abnormal laboratory parameters, characteristic radiologic and endoscopic changes within the gastrointestinal tract and most importantly a supportive histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The article is intended mainly for the general gastroenterologist and for other interested physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Management of small bowel CD has been suboptimal and limited due to the inaccessibility of the small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enteroscopy has had a significant renaissance recently, thereby extending the reach of the endoscopist, aiding diagnosis and enabling therapeutic interventions in the small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiologic imaging is used as the first line modality to visualise the small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the clinical suspicion is high, wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is used to rule out superficial and early disease, despite the above investigations being <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is followed by push enteroscopy or device assisted enteroscopy (DAE) as is appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approach has been found to be the most cost effective and least invasive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DAE includes balloon-assisted enteroscopy, [double balloon enteroscopy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi>), single balloon enteroscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SBE</z:e>) and more recently spiral enteroscopy (SE)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This review is not going to cover the various other indications of enteroscopy, radiological small bowel investigations nor WCE and limited only to enteroscopy in small bowel Crohn's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These excluded topics already have comprehensive reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Evidence available from randomized controlled trials comparing the various modalities is limited and at best regarded as Grade C or D (based on expert opinion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The evidence suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three DAE modalities have comparable insertion depths, diagnostic and therapeutic efficacies and complication rates, though most favour <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> due to higher rates of total enteroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SE is quicker than <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi>, but lower complete enteroscopy rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SBE</z:e> has quicker procedural times and is evolving but the least available DAE today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Larger prospective randomised controlled trial's in the future could help us understand some unanswered areas including the role of BAE in small bowel screening and comparative studies between the main types of enteroscopy in small bowel CD </plain></SENT>
