<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This modality is a valuable tool for the diagnosis of obscure small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), and can also be used for monitoring of disease activity in patients with established small-bowel CD, detection of complications such as obscure <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, evaluation of response to anti-inflammatory treatment and postoperative recurrence following small bowel resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VCE could also be an important tool in the management of patients with unclassified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, potentially resulting in reclassification of these patients as having CD </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of colonic inflammatory activity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> using the recently developed colonic capsule has also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Capsule endoscopy is associated with an excellent safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although retention risk is increased in patients with small bowel CD, this risk can be significanty decreased by a routine utilization of a dissolvable patency capsule preceding the ingestion of the diagnostic capsule </plain></SENT>
