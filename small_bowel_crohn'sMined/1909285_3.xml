<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Measurement of postheparin plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15571,23666">diamine</z:chebi> oxidase (PHD) activity has been proposed to assess mucosal integrity in several diseases of the small intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, PHD values identify a group of patients with predominantly small bowel mucosal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of mucosal involvement in the progression of small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and whether different PHD values can predict different outcomes the changes in PHD values in 41 patients with small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> admitted consecutively to our department were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The test was performed during periods of active disease and after either medical or surgical treatment had resulted in improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PHD values were significantly lower than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range 3.7-7.7 U/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 35 patients with active disease (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index (CDAI) greater than 150) two groups were identified by choosing a cut off value of 2 U/ml: 93% of the 15 patients with PHD values lower than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 1.36 (0.46) U/ml) relapsed at least once in the following year, while only the 20% of the 20 whose values were higher than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 3.69 (1.50)) relapsed in the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data were statistically significant (Yates's corrected chi 2 = 15.63; p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive and negative predictive values of the test were 93% and 80%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During relapses, PHD values were consistently lower than previous values, and increased significantly after effective medical or surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the six patients in whom there were no changes in disease activity (CDAI persistently less than 150), there was no change in PHD values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This test may be useful for identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> patients who are likely to relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the data indicate that mucosal damage is common in active small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and improves at least in part after treatment </plain></SENT>
