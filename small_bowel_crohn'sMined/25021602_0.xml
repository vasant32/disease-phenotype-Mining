<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: In patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of IBD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and/or diarrhoea) in common with ECCO guidelines colonoscopy is the first line test at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our practice magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is then performed in those patients where there is a continuing clinical suspicion of small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However in patients who present to non-IBD physicians Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast (CTAP) is often the first line investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this situation MRE is commonly performed to exclude small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> following review in the gastroenterology clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We are not aware of studies that have evaluated the additional diagnostic yield of MRE in this clinical scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AIM: to establish the additional diagnostic yield of MRE in patients previously investigated with CTAP and ileo-colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our radiology department maintain a prospective electronic database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We searched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent CTAP followed by MRE within the same 12 month period between February 2005 and February 2013 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electronic medical records were then reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 80 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean age at time of MRE was 49 (range 17-87), 45 (56%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Indication for these investigations were: assessment of known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>; 18 (23%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>; 34 (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean time between CTAP and MRE; 127 days (range 3-352) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Final diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>; 37 (45%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>; 4(5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> 4(5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 11(14%) MRE added further information or changed the management for the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of this group in 3 patients MRE identified terminal ileal (TI) <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> that was not identified at CTAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In two of these cases ileal-colonoscopy collaborated TI <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and in the third case capsule enteroscopy confirmed TI <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three the final diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Overall MRE identified one (1.25%) patient with possible CD that was missed at CTAP and ileo-colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study the diagnostic yield of MRE in patients previously investigated with ileo-colonoscopy and CTAP was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This suggests that MRE has a limited diagnostic role in this specific situation and should be reserved for those patients where clinical suspicion remains high despite negative CTAP and ileo-colonoscopy or to further define complex disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
