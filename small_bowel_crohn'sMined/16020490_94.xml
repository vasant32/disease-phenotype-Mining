<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy (CE) compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is not well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively investigated CE, MRI, and double contrast fluoroscopy in patients with suspected small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty two consecutive patients (39 females, 13 males) were investigated by MRI, fluoroscopy and--if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> could be excluded--by CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 25, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was newly suspected while the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (non-small bowel) had been previously established in 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 41 of 52 patients (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CE was not accomplished in 14 patients due to bowel strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 27 patients, CE, MRI, and fluoroscopy detected small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in 25 (93%), 21 (78%), and 7 (of 21; 33%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CE was the only diagnostic tool in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CE was slightly more sensitive than MRI (12 v 10 of 13 in suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 13 v 11 of 14 in established <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI detected inflammatory conglomerates and enteric fistulae in three and two cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CE and MRI are complementary methods for diagnosing small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CE is capable of detecting limited mucosal lesions that may be missed by MRI, but awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MRI is helpful in identifying transmural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and extraluminal lesions, and may exclude strictures </plain></SENT>
