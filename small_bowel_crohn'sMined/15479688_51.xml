<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND/ AIM: Although ultrasound (US) has proved to be useful in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal diseases</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enteroclysis (BE) remains the gold standard technique for assessing patients with small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ingestion of anechoic non-absorbable solutions has been recently proposed in order to distend intestinal loops and improve small bowel visualisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors' aim was to evaluate the accuracy of oral contrast US in finding CD lesions, assessing their extent within the bowel, and detecting <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> complications, compared with BE and ileocolonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 102 consecutive patients with proven CD, having undergone complete x ray and endoscopic evaluation, were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each US examination, before and after the ingestion of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>) solution (500-800 ml), was performed independently by two sonographers unaware of the results of other diagnostic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of conventional and contrast enhanced US in detecting CD lesions and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> complications, as well as the extent of bowel involvement, were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement between sonographers with both US techniques was also estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After oral contrast, satisfactory distension of the intestinal lumen was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with a mean time to reach the terminal ileum of 31.4 (SD 10.9) minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall sensitivity of conventional and oral contrast US in detecting CD lesions were 91.4% and 96.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient between US and x ray extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileal disease</z:e> was r1 = 0.83 (p&lt;0.001) before and r2 = 0.94 (p&lt;0.001) after <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> ingestion; r1 versus r2 p&lt;0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity in detecting strictures was 74% for conventional US and 89% for contrast US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall interobserver agreement for bowel wall thickness and disease location within the small bowel was already good before but significantly improved after <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral contrast bowel US is comparable with BE in defining anatomic location and extension of CD and superior to conventional US in detecting <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> complications, as well as reducing interobserver variability between sonographers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It may be therefore regarded as the first imaging procedure in the diagnostic work up and follow up of small intestine CD </plain></SENT>
