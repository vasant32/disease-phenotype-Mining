<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using decision analytic modeling, total and yearly costs of diagnostic work-up for suspected CD were calculated, including procedure-related adverse events, hospitalizations, office visits, and medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model compared CE to SBFT following ileo-colonoscopy and secondarily compared CE to SBFT for initial evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aggregate charges for newly diagnosed, medically managed patients are approximately $8295 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients requiring aggressive medical management costs are $29,508; requiring hospitalization, $49,074 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At sensitivity &gt; 98.7% and specificity of &gt; 86.4%, CE is less costly than SBFT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Costs of CE for diagnostic evaluation of suspected CD is comparable to SBFT and may be used immediately following ileo-colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
