<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, ileocolonoscopy and biopsies of the terminal ileum as well as of each colonic segment to look for microscopic evidence of CD are the first-line procedures to establish the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it has been observed that up to 30% of the patients have only small bowel involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the small bowel has been made with radiological procedures, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> radiography, and abdominal computed tomography or by ileocolonoscopy or enteroscopy, but they have many recognized limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CE is undoubtedly a very useful diagnostic tool proposed to observe small-bowel lesions undetectable by conventional endoscopy or radiologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We review different studies that have been published reporting the use of CE in suspected and evaluation of the extension or the recurrence in CD and also its use in pediatric population and its complications </plain></SENT>
