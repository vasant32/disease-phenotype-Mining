<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of this the levels of IgG and IgA antibodies against three S cerevisiae strains (NCYC 77, NCYC 79, and NCYC 1108) were assayed in 49 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 43 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 14 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, and 21 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coded serum samples were tested by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar antibody patterns to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three strains were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgA antibody levels were significantly raised in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> compared with healthy controls (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.0001 respectively) and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients (p &lt; 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.0006 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Raised IgA, but not IgG, yeast antibody levels were found in two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> who were intolerant to yeast, but these values were similar to those in other patients without yeast intolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, both IgG and IgA levels were similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had significantly higher IgG antibody levels than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High levels of IgG, but not IgA, antibody were present in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, the antibody responses being indistinguishable from those found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the presence of IgG antibody to S cerevisiae is characteristic but not specific to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although raised IgA antibody levels are more frequently found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, their pathogenic importance remains to be established </plain></SENT>
