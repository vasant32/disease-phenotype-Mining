<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hemihyperplasia (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo>) is defined as asymmetric body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of one or more body parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemihyperplasia can be isolated or be part of well-defined syndromes such as in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isolated hemihyperplasia is usually <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, but a number of familial occurrences have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a Tunisian family in which three maternal cousins and their maternal grandfather present with isolated hemihyperplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of isolated hemihyperplasia is unknown although in BWS, <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> has been shown to play a role in the asymmetric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given the similarity between these two conditions, it is possible that both may share a common pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also discuss the possible genetic mechanisms leading to the production of hemihyperplasia in this family </plain></SENT>
