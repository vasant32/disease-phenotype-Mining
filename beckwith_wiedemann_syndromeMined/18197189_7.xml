<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the first clinical report of sibs with the multiple maternal hypomethylation syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both sisters presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008255'>transient neonatal diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (TNDM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By methylation-specific PCR of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi>-treated DNA, we found a mosaic spectrum of hypomethylation at the following maternally methylated loci in both sibs: ZAC (6q24), KCNQ1OT1 (11p15.5), GRB10 (7p11.2-12), PEG3 (19q13), PEG1/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MEST</z:e> (7q32), and NESPAS (20q13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the older sister has a milder phenotype, the younger one was severely ill and died at 11 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite phenotypic differences, the sisters had several manifestations of both TNDM and BWS in common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The family is highly consanguineous, and the parents are first cousins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the genetic defect in this family is a novel, most likely <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> defect of methylation mechanisms, either in the sisters or in their mother, affecting her oocyte imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recurrence with affected sibs as reported in this family has implications for genetic counselling </plain></SENT>
