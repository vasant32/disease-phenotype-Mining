<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The glypicans compose a family of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi>-anchored <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> that may play a role in the control of cell division and growth regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, six members (GPC1-6) of this family are known in vertebrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the construction of a high-resolution 4 Mb sequence-ready BAC/PAC contig of the GPC5/GPC6 gene cluster on chromosome region 13q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contig indicates that, like the GPC3/GPC4 genes on Xq26, GPC5 and GPC6 are arranged in tandem array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both GPC5 and GPC6 are very large genes, with sizes well over 1 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a size of approximately 2 Mb, GPC5 would be the second largest human gene identified to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the long range gene organisation on 13q and Xq, suggests that these chromosomes share several regions of homology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations and deletions affecting GPC3 are associated with the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis of GPC5 and GPC6 in 19 patients with somatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> failed to reveal pathologic mutations in either of these genes, but identified several coding region polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
