<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fetal outcomes are variable and are often associated with growth restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, enigmatically, some associated fetuses show signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PMD has recently been shown to result from androgenetic (complete paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>) chimerism in the placenta in pregnancies that were associated with some fetal growth restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases of PMD associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> have not previously been investigated molecularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present a case of focal PMD associated with a male fetus showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> with an <z:mp ids='MP_0000274'>enlarged heart</z:mp>, marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001791'>fetal ascites</z:hpo> and intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 34 weeks, but no other BWS manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mosaicism for an unbalanced translocation leading to deletion of the maternal copy of the BWS region on 11p15.5 and partial duplication of 17q was observed in placenta, but not fetal samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the placental findings of PMD can be caused by an unbalanced dosage of genes in 11p15.5 alone, fetal growth parameters appear to depend on the underlying mechanism and likely also the level and distribution of abnormal cells </plain></SENT>
