<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1298180" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">single tumor</z:e>-relevant genes with linkage to this region (e.g. LMO1) have been found suggesting that this region may harbor additional potential disease associated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although this genomic area has been studied for years, the exact order of genes/chromosome markers between D11S572 and the WEE1 gene locus remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the FISH technique and PAC clones of the flanking markers we determined the order of the genomic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these clones we established a PAC contig of the respective region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To analyse the chromosome area in detail the synteny of the orthologous region on distal mouse chromosome 7 was determined and a corresponding mouse clone contig established, proving the conserved order of the genes and markers in both species: "cen-WEE1-D11S2043-ZNF143-RANBP7-CEGF1- ST5-D11S932-LMO1-D11S572-TUB-tel", with inverted order of the murine genes with respect to the telomere/centromere orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The region covered by these contigs comprises roughly 1.6 MB in human as well as in mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genomic sequence of the two subregions (around WEE1 and LMO1) in both species was determined using a shotgun sequencing strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparative sequence analysis techniques demonstrate that the content of repetitive elements seems to decline from centromere to telomere (52.6% to 34.5%) in human and in the corresponding murine region from telomere to centromere (41.87% to 27.82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genomic organisation of the regions around WEE1 and LMO1 was conserved, although the length of gene regions varied between the species in an unpredictable ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CpG islands were found conserved in putative promoter regions of the known genes but also in regions which so far have not been described as harboring expressed sequences </plain></SENT>
