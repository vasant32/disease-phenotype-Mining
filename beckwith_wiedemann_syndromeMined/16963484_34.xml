<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, epimutations and maternal duplications affecting the short arm of chromosome 11 have been shown to have a crucial role in the aetiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disturbances in the same genomic region cause the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disorder <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In BWS, mutations in the telomeric as well as in the centromeric imprinting centres (ICR1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e>) in 11p15 can be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In SRS, methylation defects in the imprinted region in 11p15 were considered to be restricted to the telomeric ICR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They can be detected in about 30% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This article reports on the first patient with SRS with a cryptic duplication restricted to the centromeric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> domain in 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maternally inherited duplication in this patient included a region of 0.76-1 Mbp and affected the genes regulated by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e>, among them CDKN1C and LIT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence for a role for this imprinting centre in the aetiology of SRS and shows that SRS presents a picture genetically opposite to that of BWS </plain></SENT>
