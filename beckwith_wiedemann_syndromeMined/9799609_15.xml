<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the human KVLQT1 gene is imprinted and disrupted in patients with germline balanced chromosomal rearrangements and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In human, the gene is imprinted in most fetal tissues except the heart, and KVLQT1 is part of a 1-Mb cluster of imprinted genes on human chromosome 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether the mouse Kvlqt1 gene is imprinted, by performing interspecific crosses of 129/SvEv mice with CAST/Ei (Mus musculus castaneus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified a transcribed polymorphism that distinguishes the two parental alleles in F1 offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Examination of embryonic, neonatal, and postnatal tissues revealed that Kvlqt1 is imprinted in mouse early embryos, in both female 129 x male CS and female CS x male 129 offspring, with preferential expression of the maternal allele, like the human homologue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, imprinting was developmentally relaxed, and the developmental stage and tissue specificity of relaxation of imprinting was strain-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first example of an endogenous gene that shows strain-dependent developmental relaxation of imprinting </plain></SENT>
