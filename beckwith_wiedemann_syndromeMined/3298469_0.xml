<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indications for fetoscopy were visualization of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic membrane for morphological anomaly and fetal blood sampling for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis, made by visual observation of the fetus, blood coagulation tests, and karyotyping revealed 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetuses and 5 abnormal fetuses (one having chromosome abnormality, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002636" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amniotic band syndrome</z:e>, one cephalothracopagus, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, and one sacral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Courses of pregnancy following fetoscopy resulted in four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> full-term deliveries, six <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature deliveries</z:hpo> due to four hydramnions and two spontaneous ruptures of the membrane more than 14 weeks after fetoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three other pregnancies were interrupted due to intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 11 weeks after fetoscopy in one case and to therapeutic abortion for maternal complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100603'>toxemia of pregnancy</z:hpo> in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome of one case was unknown because the mother had moved away </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other pregnancy is still under observation at the third trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although no complications in the fetuses were seen following fetoscopy, complications in the mothers included two cases of genital <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, one case of amniotic fluid leakage, and one cases of abruption of the fetal membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases disappeared during several days of bed rest </plain></SENT>
