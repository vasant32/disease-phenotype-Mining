<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The epigenetic-risk notion was invoked and a link between ART and diseases associated with imprinting alterations was suggested with different examples, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The epigenetic "life cycle" of imprinting (germline erasure, germline establishment, and somatic maintenance) concerns <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the phases from gametogenesis, gamete maturation, fertilization, to early embryo development and appears particularly vulnerable to perturbations induced by superovulation, in vitro fertilization, embryo culture and embryo transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studies, performed in model animal, provide a basis of the understanding of imprinting alterations induced by the ART and clinically useful information in order to improve the ART </plain></SENT>
