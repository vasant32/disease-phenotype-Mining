<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with the character and incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, and discuss the role of radiological followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> who were treated at our institution between March 1979 and February 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiological followup consisted of renal ultrasound at approximately 3 to 6-month intervals with the addition of computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with an indeterminate lesion(s) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100880'>nephrogenic rest</z:hpo>(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these cases renal ultrasound showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> kidneys bilaterally in 19 (70%), simple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> in 5 (19%), indeterminate lesion(s) in 2 (7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000121'>nephrocalcinosis</z:hpo> in 1 (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100880'>Nephrogenic rests</z:hpo> were followed with MRI in 1 patient, and 1 in whom a 2 cm. mass was revealed by followup MRI underwent partial nephrectomy and chemotherapy for stage I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 3.7% incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> in our patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> is similar to that in previously published reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aggressive follow-up by a sensitive radiological technique is warranted in cases of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> and/or nephromegaly with or without evidence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> precursor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The detection of suspected malignant disease at an early stage may permit curative nephron sparing surgery </plain></SENT>
