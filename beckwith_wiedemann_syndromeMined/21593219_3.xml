<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nuclear transfer experiments undertaken in the mid-80's revealed that both maternal and paternal genomes are necessary for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is due to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, an epigenetic mechanism that results in parent-of-origin monoallelic expression of genes regulated by germline-derived allelic methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, ∼100 imprinted transcripts have been identified in mouse, with approximately two-thirds showing conservation in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is currently unknown how many imprinted genes are present in humans, and to what extent these transcripts exhibit human-specific imprinted expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is mainly due to the fact that the majority of screens for imprinted genes have been undertaken in mouse, with subsequent analysis of the human orthologues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Utilizing extremely rare reciprocal genome-wide <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> samples presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> and Silver-Russell syndrome-like phenotypes, we analyzed ∼0.1% of CpG dinculeotides present in the human genome for imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using the Illumina Infinium methylation27 BeadChip microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach identified 15 imprinted DMRs associated with characterized imprinted domains, and confirmed the maternal methylation of the RB1 DMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we discovered two novel DMRs, first, one maternally methylated region overlapping the FAM50B promoter CpG island, which results in paternal expression of this retrotransposon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we found a paternally methylated, bidirectional repressor located between maternally expressed ZNF597 and NAT15 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These three genes are biallelically expressed in mice due to lack of differential methylation, suggesting that these genes have become imprinted after the divergence of mouse and humans </plain></SENT>
