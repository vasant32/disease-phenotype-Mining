<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies reported a wide variation in the skeletal and occlusal characteristics in individuals affected by BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these studies were performed by analyzing both individuals who had and those had not received a glossectomy, which has a high impact on the jaw growth and occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To highlight the intrinsic characteristics of BWS, 7 Japanese affected individuals without glossectomy were analyzed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven individuals who had been diagnosed with BWS by medical specialists and had not undergone glossectomy were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cephalograms and dental casts were taken and systemic complications were recorded at the first visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Individuals uniformly showed a higher birth height and weight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, large anterior cranial base, and mandibular body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They exhibited a wide dental arch and an anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0010807'>open bite</z:hpo> due to the undererupted and proclined anterior teeth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A wide variation was seen in the gonial angle, but the facial height was large overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As intrinsic characteristics of BWS, individuals exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> resulting in an anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0010807'>open bite</z:hpo> and a wide dental arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A long facial height and an enlarged anterior cranial base and mandibular body were also noted </plain></SENT>
