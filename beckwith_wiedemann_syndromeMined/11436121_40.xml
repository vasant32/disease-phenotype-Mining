<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This multigenic disorder is caused by dysregulation of the expression of imprinted genes in the 11p15 chromosomal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular diagnosis of BWS is currently difficult, mostly due to the large spectrum of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other difficulty in managing BWS is the identification of patients at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An imprinted antisense transcript within KCNQ1, called KCNQ1OT (also known as LIT1), was recently shown to be normally expressed from the paternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A loss of imprinting of the KCNQ1OT gene, associated with the loss of maternal allele-specific methylation of the differentially methylated region KvDMR1 has been described in BWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The principal aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of KvDMR1 methylation analysis of leukocyte DNA for the diagnosis of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The allelic status of the 11p15 region and the methylation status of the KCNQ1OT and H19 genes were investigated in leukocyte DNA from 97 patients referred for BWS and classified into two groups according to clinical data: complete BWS (CBWS) (n=61) and incomplete BWS (IBWS) (n=36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight (60%) patients (39/61 CBWS and 19/36 IBWS) displayed abnormal demethylation of KvDMR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 11 of the 56 informative cases, demethylation of KvDMR1 was related to 11p15 <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) (nine CBWS and two IBWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 39 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation of KvDMR1 displayed hypermethylation of the H19 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These 13 patients included two siblings with 11p15 <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results show that analysis of the methylation status of KvDMR1 and the H19 gene in leukocyte DNA is useful in the diagnosis of 11p15-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes, resulting in the diagnosis of BWS in more than 70% of investigated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated clinical and molecular features as prognostic factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and showed that mosaicism for 11p15 UPD and hypermethylation of the H19 gene in blood cells were associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
