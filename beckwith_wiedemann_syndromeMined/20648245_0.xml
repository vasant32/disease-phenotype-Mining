<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-up showed continued <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and disturbed <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, a marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260657" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural problems</z:e> especially caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxieties</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis showed a de novo 12q24.31 interstitial deletion, which was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The deleted region contains amongst others: HNF1 homeobox A (HNF1A) which is important for the regulation of gene expression in the liver and involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> type 3 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> dehydrogenase short chain (ACADS) which encodes an enzyme important in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fatty acid beta-oxidation and can cause short-chain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> dehydrogenese (SCAD) deficiency, and purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2RX7) which encodes a ligand-gated ion channel, and of which polymorphisms are found with increased frequency in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxieties</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude the present patient has a hitherto undescribed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001466'>contiguous gene syndrome</z:hpo>, which can initially resemble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
