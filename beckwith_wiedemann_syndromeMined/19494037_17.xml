<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, data obtained in humans are inconclusive; however, some epidemiological studies have demonstrated an increased incidence of imprinting disorders in children conceived by ARTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we focused on the effect of ARTs [IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)] on the epigenetic reprogramming of the maternally methylated imprinting control region KvDMR1 in clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Qualitative and quantitative methylation at KvDMR1 were assessed by the methylation-specific PCR approach and by the methylation-sensitive enzymatic digestion associated with real-time PCR method, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was obtained from peripheral blood of 12/18 and umbilical cord blood and placenta of 6/18 children conceived by IVF or ICSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methylation patterns observed in this group were compared with the patterns observed in 30 clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> naturally conceived children (negative controls) and in 3 naturally conceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> patients (positive controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypomethylation at KvDMR1 was observed in 3/18 clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children conceived by ARTs (2 conceived by IVF and 1 by ICSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A discordant methylation pattern was observed in the three corresponding dizygotic twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings corroborate the hypothesis of vulnerability of <z:mp ids='MP_0003122'>maternal imprinting</z:mp> to ARTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the discordant methylation at KvDMR1 observed between dizygotic twins could be consequent to one of the following possibilities: (i) a differential vulnerability of maternal imprints among different embryos; or (ii) epimutations that occurred during gametogenesis resulting in the production of oocytes without the correct primary imprint at KvDMR1 </plain></SENT>
