<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many human syndromes involve a loss of imprinting (LOI) due to a loss (LOM) or a gain of methylation (GOM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most LOI occur as mosaics and can therefore be difficult to detect with conventional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human imprinted 11p15 region is crucial for the control of fetal growth and LOI at this locus is associated with two clinical disorders with opposite phenotypes: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), characterized by fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS) characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until recently, we have been using Southern blotting for the diagnosis of RSS and BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe here a powerful quantitative technique, allele-specific methylated multiplex real-time quantitative PCR (ASMM RTQ-PCR), for the diagnosis of these two complex disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We first checked the specificity of the probes and primers used for ASMM RTQ-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We then carried out statistical validation for this method, on both retrospective and prospective populations of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This analysis demonstrated that ASMM RTQ-PCR is more sensitive than Southern blotting for detecting low degree of LOI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ASMM RTQ-PCR is a very rapid, reliable, simple, safe and cost effective method. Â© 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc </plain></SENT>
