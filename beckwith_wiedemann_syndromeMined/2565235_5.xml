<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The syndrome is characterised by a complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>, but recent evidence indicates that it is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait with variable penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been previously suggested that major rearrangements of the short arm of chromosome 11 are involved in the aetiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We undertook to search for rearrangements in 11p in four patients with BWS and their parents and siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using cloned DNA fragments homologous to four genes located on 11p, namely catalase, parathyroid hormone, insulin-like growth factor II and the proto-oncogene c-Ha-Ras, we subjected DNA from the patients to a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis after digestion with restriction enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence for any large scale deletions or amplifications in this chromosomal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that altered gene dosage is not, as has been suggested, a requirement for the development of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This raises the question of whether some other molecular mechanism is responsible for the malformations observed </plain></SENT>
