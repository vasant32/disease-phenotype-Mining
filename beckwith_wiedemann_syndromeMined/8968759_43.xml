<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that in some patients without cytogenetic abnormalities the otherwise repressed maternal copy of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene is expressed, leading to biallelic expression of IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In some of these cases, this is accompanied by repression and DNA methylation of the maternal (otherwise active) copy of the neighbouring H19 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, it is attractive to think that mutations may interfere with some aspect of H19 imprinting, thus leading to an inactive maternal allele, and indirectly to activation of the maternal IGF2 allele as reported in mice with an H19 gene deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no mutations have been identified so far in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only known mutations associated with BWS are maternally transmitted translocations, which are clustered in two locations centrometric to IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first cluster is 200-400 kb from IGF2 and the second is several megabases away </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hence, genes located far from the translocation breakpoints are potentially deregulated by them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here we provide the first evidence of alteration of imprinting in a translocation family, with biallelic expression of IGF2 and altered DNA replication patterns in the IGF2 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, H19 imprinting was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, suggesting an H19-independent pathway to biallelic IGF2 transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation in IGF2 remained monoallelic, suggesting that the mutation in this family had uncoupled allele-specific methylation from expression </plain></SENT>
