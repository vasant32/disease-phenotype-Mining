<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Loss of function mutations in the genes encoding the pancreatic Î²-cell ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (KATP) channel are identified in approximately 80% of patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> unresponsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000825'>hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (HH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For a small number of patients HH can occur as part of a multisystem disease such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In approximately 20% of patients, BWS results from chromosome 11 paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD), which causes dysregulation of imprinted growth regulation genes at 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is a considerable range in the clinical features and phenotypic severity associated with BWS which is likely to be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cause of HH in these patients is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Research Design and Methods: We undertook microsatellite analysis of 12 markers spanning chromosome 11p in two patients with severe HH and diffuse disease requiring a pancreatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both patients mutations in the K(ATP) channel genes had not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: We identified segmental paternal UPD in DNA extracted from pancreatic tissue in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>UPD was not observed in DNA extracted from the patient's leukocytes or buccal samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both cases the UPD encompassed the differentially methylated region at chromosome 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite this neither patient had any further features of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Paternal UPD of the chromosome 11p15.5 differentially methylated region limited to the pancreatic tissue may represent a novel cause of isolated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> unresponsive HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity studies should therefore be considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with severe HH who have undergone pancreatic surgery when K(ATP) channel mutation(s) have not been identified </plain></SENT>
