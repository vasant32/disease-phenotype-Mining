<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bias in parental origin for the different etiologic forms of this syndrome and for loss of heterozygosity in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> suggests that a gene (or genes) mapping to this region undergoes <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the precise localization of the locus (or loci) for the BWS and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is still unknown and more markers are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore isolated 11p15 markers from two libraries: the first one obtained by microdissection of the chromosome 11p15.5 region and the second one, a phage library, constructed from a hybrid cell line containing this region as its sole human DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 19 microclones isolated from the microdissection library, 11 were evolutionarily conserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four phage clones were isolated; one (D11S774) detected a highly informative variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and another (D11S773) a biallelic polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These clones were sublocalized using a panel of somatic cell hybrids that defines eight physical intervals in 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one clones map to the distal interval that harbors the BWS locus </plain></SENT>
