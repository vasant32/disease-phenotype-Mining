<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CDK4 activity is inhibited by CDKN1C, which is regulated by insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, CDKN1C plays an important role in beta-cell proliferation and is involved in the pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, a disorder characterized by neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000825'>hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia</z:hpo> and pre- and post-natal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate if variations in the proximal promoter and the coding region of the CDKN1C and CDK4 genes are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or changes in related quantitative phenotypes among <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation analyses of the two genes in 62 type 2 diabetic patients resulted in the discovery of seven variants of CDKN1C and two variants of CDK4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a case-control study comprising 717 type 2 diabetic patients and 518 glucose-tolerant subjects the most frequent variants did not show any difference in allele frequencies between the type 2 diabetic patients and the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in two genotype-quantitative trait correlation studies involving 206 glucose-tolerant offspring of type 2 diabetic patients and 359 young, healthy subjects the CDKN1C del171APVA variant associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0009673'>increased birth weight</z:mp> (P=0.05 and P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the same variant tended to be associated with decreased basal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation among 16 genotypically discordant dizygotic twins (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a genotype-quantitative trait study involving 500 middle-aged <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-tolerant subjects the CDK4 IVS2-31G--&gt;A variant was associated with an increased waist circumference (P=0.03) and waist-to-hip ratio (P=0.02) and altered fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, these later findings could not be replicated in additional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, variants in CDKN1C may contribute to the inter-individual variation in birth weight </plain></SENT>
