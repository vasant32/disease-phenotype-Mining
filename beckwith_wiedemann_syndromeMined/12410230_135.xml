<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in methylation between the two parental chromosomes are often observed at or near imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), which predisposes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and excessive growth, results from a disruption of imprinted gene expression in chromosome band 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One third of individuals with BWS lose maternal-specific methylation at KvDMR1, a putative imprinting control region within intron 10 of the KCNQ1 gene, and it has been proposed that this epimutation results in aberrant imprinting and, consequently, BWS1, 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of a deletion of KvDMR1 results in the de-repression in cis of six genes, including Cdkn1c, which encodes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fetuses and adult mice that inherited the deletion from their fathers were 20-25% smaller than their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of this deletion had no effect on imprinted gene expression or growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the unmethylated paternal KvDMR1 allele regulates imprinted expression by silencing genes on the paternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that loss of methylation in BWS patients activates the repressive function of KvDMR1 on the maternal chromosome, resulting in abnormal silencing of CDKN1C and the development of BWS </plain></SENT>
