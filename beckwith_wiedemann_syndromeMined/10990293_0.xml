<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BWS is a malformation syndrome associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major features of BWS are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defects</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003271'>visceromegaly</z:hpo>, frequently leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature birth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> patterns, a predominance of nonfamilial cases, and the variability in expression of the features (termed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo>), the risk of delayed diagnosis is evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary to hyperplastic pancreatic islands, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurs frequently, and if not anticipated, adequate measures for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> may be delayed, resulting in possible intellectual deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infant presented here died of natural causes: immaturity of the lungs resulting in marginal respiratory function and compounded by increased risk for asphyxia secondary to the <z:mp ids='MP_0009906'>enlarged tongue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical history and findings in this infant are discussed in respect to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndrome</z:e> with their relevance to medicolegal examination and the causes and manner of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
