<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified BWS patients who had inherited a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biparental chromosome complement of the chromosome 11p15.5 region (where IGF2 and H19 reside), but had an altered pattern of allelic methylation of both genes, with the maternal chromosome carrying a parental imprinting pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fibroblasts, IGF2 was expressed from both parental alleles and H19 was not expressed, precisely as predicted from the altered pattern of allelic methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, DNA replication patterns of the 11p15.5 region remained asynchronous as in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results therefore provide the first example of the dissociation of regional control of DNA replication from regional control of allelic methylation and expression in imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the altered pattern of allelic methylation and expression arises in the germline or in the early embryo from defects in resetting or setting of imprinting in maternal germline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Potential candidate regions for mutations include the previously identified translocation breakpoint clusters and the H19 gene itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding of possible 'imprinting mutations' in BWS raises the prospect of identifying genetic factors that control imprinting in this region </plain></SENT>
