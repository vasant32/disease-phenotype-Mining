<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Careful study of pregnancy outcome in humans is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This preliminary report includes follow-up data of patients treated with the GnRH <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, ganirelix, during ovarian stimulation for IVF or ICSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 333 patients were randomized in a multicentre, double-blind, dose-finding study of ganirelix, at six different doses ranging from 0.0625 to 2 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 68 vital intrauterine pregnancies were established that resulted in the birth of 46 singletons, 12 twins and one triplet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of the 67 pregnant patients (one subject was lost to follow-up) revealed six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 61 subjects with an ongoing pregnancy, two with a singleton pregnancy did not give birth to a live-born infant (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> in week 19, and one intrauterine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in week 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean gestational age was 39.4 weeks for singleton pregnancies, and 36.6 weeks for multiple pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total, 73 infants (33 boys, 40 girls) were born </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A birth weight &lt;2500 g was reported for 8.7% and 54.2% of the infants resulting from singleton and twins delivery respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e> was diagnosed; a boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven minor malformations were reported among five infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this first follow-up study, the incidence of adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcome was comparable with reported incidences for IVF-embryo transfer pregnancies </plain></SENT>
