<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In several ways, the 11p15 imprinted region is an exemplary model for regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two imprinted domains are controlled by imprinting control regions (ICRs) which carry opposite germ line imprints and they are regulated by two major mechanisms of imprinting control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of 11p15 <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> results in two fetal growth disorders [Silver-Russell (SRS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> (BWS) syndromes], with opposite growth phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BWS and SRS result from <z:mp ids='MP_0003787'>abnormal imprinting</z:mp> involving either, both domains or only one of them, with ICR1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> more often involved in SRS and BWS respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation defects affecting ICR1 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> account for approximately 60% of SRS and BWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have identified new cis-acting regulatory elements, as well as new trans-acting factors involved in the regulation of 11p15 imprinting, therefore establishing new mechanisms of BWS and SRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those studies also showed that, apart of CTCF, other transcription factors, including factors of the pluripotency network, play a crucial role in the regulation of 11p15 <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those new findings have direct consequences in molecular testing, risk assessment and genetic counseling of BWS and SRS patients </plain></SENT>
