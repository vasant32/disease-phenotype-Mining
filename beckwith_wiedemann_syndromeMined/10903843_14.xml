<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently described a novel putative Ca(2+) channel gene, MTR1, which shows a high level of homology to the human TRPC7 gene and the melastatin 1 (MLSN1) gene, another Trp (transient receptor potential protein)-related gene whose transcript was found to be downregulated in metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It maps to human chromosome band 11p15.5, which is associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and predisposition to a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the isolation and characterization of the murine orthologue Mtr1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal localization on distal chromosome 7 places it in a cluster of imprinted genes, flanked by the previously described Tapa1 and Kcnq1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Mtr1 gene encodes a 4.4-kb transcript, present in a variety of fetal and adult tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The putative open reading frame consists of 24 exons, encoding 1158 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transmembrane prediction algorithms indicate the presence of six membrane-spanning domains in the proposed protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Imprinting analysis, using RT-PCR on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from reciprocal mouse crosses harboring a sequence polymorphism, revealed biallelic expression of Mtr1 transcripts at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages and tissues examined </plain></SENT>
