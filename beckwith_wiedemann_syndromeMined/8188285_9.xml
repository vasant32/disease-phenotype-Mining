<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were first described as variants of the kidney <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>, although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of similar clinicopathologic features have been cited in a variety of extrarenal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have characterized the chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(p15.5;q11.23) from a retroperitoneal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206743" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rhabdoid tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Somatic cell hybrids with segregated copies of the derivative 11 and derivative 22 chromosomes allowed sublocalization of the chromosome 11 breakpoint to a 1- to 2-Mb region between the proximal marker D11S12 and the distal locus tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Translocation-associated aberrant fragments were identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, with the smallest resulting from BssHII digestion as detected with a probe for TH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the locus or loci disrupted by this genetic abnormality might lie less than 60 kb proximal to this marker and place it in the chromosomal vicinity of genes involved in the etiologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>, and the congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disorder, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of two other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated loci, EWS1 and NF2, that have been mapped to the general region of 22q11.2 indicated that they were not involved in this translocation breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isolation of the genes present at this translocation junction on both chromosomes 11 and 22 may yield important clinicopathologic and genetic markers for this enigmatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> as well as other pediatric diseases </plain></SENT>
