<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the most studied imprinted genes encodes insulin-like growth factor 2, and aberrant imprinting and DNA methylation of this gene is associated with the growth disorders <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> and Silver-Russell syndromes and many human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific isoforms of this gene have been shown to be essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> placental function, as mice carrying paternal null alleles for the Igf2-P0 transcript are growth restricted at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here the identification of three novel human transcripts from the IGF2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One is equivalent to the mouse Igf2-P0 transcript, whereas the two others (INSIGF long and short) originate from the upstream INS gene that alternatively splices to downstream IGF2 exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the complex imprinting of these novel IGF2 transcripts, both the allele-specific expression and methylation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the IGF2 promoters including P0 and the INSIGF transcripts were analysed in human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar to the mouse, the human IGF2-P0 transcript is paternally expressed; however, its expression is not limited to placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This expression correlates with tissue-specific promoter methylation on the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two novel INSIGF transcripts reported here use the INS promoter and show highly restricted tissue expression profiles including the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As previously reported for INS in the yolk sac, we demonstrate complex, tissue-specific imprinting of these transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The finding of additional transcripts within this locus will have important implications for IGF2 regulation in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and metabolism </plain></SENT>
