<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transmission of aberrant human 11p15.5 or duplicated 11p causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) depending on which parent the chromosome is derived from </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To analyze a syntenic mouse locus corresponding to human 11p15.5, mouse BAC contigs were constructed between Nap2 and Tapa1, in which 390 kb was sequenced between Kvlqt1 and Tapa1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An unexpected finding was that of highly conserved intronic sequences of Kvlqt1 between mouse and human, and their homologies came up to at least 160 kb because the length of this gene extended to 350 kb, suggesting the possibility of some functional constraint due to transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional regulation of this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were mapped on this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three genes, Lit1 (Kvlqt1-AS), Mtr1 and Tssc4, were identified and characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lit1 is an antisense-transcript of Kvlqt1 and paternally expressed and maternally methylated throughout the developmental stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The position where Lit1 exists corresponded to a highly conserved region between mouse and human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This transcript extends at least 60 kb from downstream to upstream of exon 10 in Kvlqt1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tssc4 and Mtr1 carried putative open reading frames but neither was imprinted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further characterization of this locus based on the sequence comparison between mouse and human will contribute valuable information towards resolving the mechanism of the occurrence of BWS and the associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
