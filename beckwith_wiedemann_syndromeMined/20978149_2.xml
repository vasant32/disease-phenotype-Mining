<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ACT is observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP) with germline APC mutations, as well as in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumors</z:e> reported to have WTX <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both APC and WTX are involved in Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulation and may play a role in ACT <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to report if APC and WTX may be associated with FAP-associated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> ACT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ACTs from patients with FAP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006744'>adrenocortical carcinomas</z:hpo> (ACC) with abnormal β-catenin localization on immunohistochemistry but no somatic β-catenin mutations were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APC was analyzed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography followed by direct sequencing and by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification when allelic loss was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WTX was studied by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four ACTs were observed in three patients with FAP and were ACC, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008256'>adrenocortical adenoma</z:hpo>, and bilateral macronodular adrenocortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with abnormal β-catenin localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biallelic inactivation of APC was strongly suggested by the simultaneous existence of somatic and germline alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ACTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> ACCs, a silent heterozygous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> as well as a rare heterozygous polymorphism in APC was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No WTX mutations were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ACT should be considered a FAP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Biallelic APC inactivation mediates activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the ACTs of patients with FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, APC and WTX genetic alterations do not play a significant role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> ACC </plain></SENT>
