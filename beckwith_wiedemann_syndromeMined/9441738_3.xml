<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chromosome band 11p15.5 has proven to be an intriguing area of the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various studies have linked alterations in this region to growth-related disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, functional assays in G401 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> cells and RD <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> cells support the existence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene on 11p15.5, sometimes called WT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, several genes mapping to this region show imprinted expression, suggesting that 11p15.5 contains an imprinted domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have employed solution hybrid capture in combination with sequence analysis to identify 16 genes within the approximately 700-kb critical region of 11p15.5 between D11S601 and D11S1318 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of these genes, NAP1L4 and KCNA9, had been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten novel transcripts were identified with partial cDNA sequences selected by solution hybrid capture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequence homology to known ESTs was used to identify the remaining gene transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the tissue-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of these genes correlates with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types linked to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This work can be compiled into a transcript map, important in the elucidation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor activity on chromosome 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
