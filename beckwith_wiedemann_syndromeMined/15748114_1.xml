<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> suffer numerous anomalies, which vary somewhat from case to case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>Cleft palate</z:hpo> in combination with this syndrome has rarely been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through two cases, this report examines the staging of the surgical repairs and the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> and the consequences of the scarred palate on mandibular development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, only two had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The timing of the repair in these two children was different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Speech development was satisfactory in the first case but mediocre in the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result seemed to be related to a poor social environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000303'>Mandibular prognathism</z:hpo> persisted in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> remains complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is preferable not to operate on a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> before performing a tongue reduction plasty, but rather to combine these two surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This would reduce the risks of anesthesia and enable the palate to heal more efficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment should be performed after the age of 6 months and before problems in speech development occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An orthognathic surgery at adolescence could be performed if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000303'>prognathism</z:hpo> persists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While the origin of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> is still being discussed, we cannot claim that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> is related to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, nor that the scarred palate has an impact on the mandibular development </plain></SENT>
