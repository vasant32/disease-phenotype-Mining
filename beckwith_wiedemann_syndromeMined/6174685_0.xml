<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In three cases the diagnosis have been done prior week 20, by systematic AFP assay for amniocentesis performed for cytogenetic or metabolic reasons; the pregnancy was terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three other cases, the pregnancy was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>hydramnios</z:hpo> after week 30; amniocentesis for AFP and echography were performed to detect fetal malformations after associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>hydramnios</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detected abdominal wall anomaly was not alone: two fetus had an abnormal caryotype (<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 18), three other presented a polymalformative syndrome, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> was discussed for the last child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in utero diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0000757'>laparoschisis</z:mp> implicates difficulties for genetic counselling, particularly if the diagnosis is done prior week 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These anomalies can be treated with surgical management, but frequency of associated malformations must be underlined. it is important for genetic counselling to know the family history, the amniotic fluid cells caryotype, and an ultrasound scanning performed to reveal any other malformations </plain></SENT>
