<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are associated with many imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mice methylation at a DMR upstream of the H19 gene known as the Imprint Control region (IC1) is acquired in the male germline and influences the methylation status of DMRs 100 kb away in the adjacent Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) gene through long-range interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, germline-derived or post-zygotically acquired imprinting defects at IC1 are associated with aberrant activation or repression of IGF2, resulting in the congenital growth disorders <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> (BWS) and Silver-Russell (SRS) syndromes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, biallelic expression of IGF2 has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This DMR, known as DMR0, has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal IGF2 allele presumably with a role in repression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of IGF2 DMR0 methylation changes in the aetiology of BWS or SRS is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analysed the methylation status of the DMR0 in BWS, SRS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> patients by conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> sequencing and pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show here that, contrary to previous reports, the IGF2 DMR0 is actually methylated on the active paternal allele in peripheral blood and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is similar to the IC1 methylation status and is inconsistent with the proposed silencing function of the maternal IGF2 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> and Silver-Russell patients with IC1 methylation defects have similar methylation defects at the IGF2 DMR0, consistent with IC1 regulating methylation at IGF2 in cis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e>, however, methylation profiles of IC1 and IGF2 DMR0 are indicative of methylation changes occurring on both parental alleles rather than in cis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results support a model in which DMR0 and IC1 have opposite susceptibilities to global hyper and hypomethylation during <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> independent of the parent of origin imprint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, during embryogenesis DMR0 is methylated or demethylated according to the germline methylation imprint at the IC1, indicating different mechanisms of imprinting loss in neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
