<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 37 malignant and nine benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> reported in approximately 250 cases with complete and incomplete forms of WBS, this is the fourth patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, 28 cases of WBS have been cytogenetically investigated with banding techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Constitutional anomalies have been found in only nine cases: Various anomalies resulting in a common triplication of the 11p15 region in six cases, reciprocal translocations t(11;22) and t(X;1) and an inversion of chromosome #2 in the three remaining cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Triplication 11p15 was only present in one of four cases with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints of the unique del(11)(p11.1p11.2) present in our case are proximal to those of del(11p13-11p14) and dup(11p15) observed thus far in both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> association and in WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inversion of chromosome #9--one of the heterochromatin variants associated with elevated <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp>, increased congenital abnormalities, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> proneness--may have been causally connected with a genetic imbalance resulting in the de novo deletion of 11p11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that in these high-risk groups, C-banding studies should be performed together with high resolution chromosome analysis in order to also reveal the incidence and significance of C-band variants in individuals with such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prone syndromes </plain></SENT>
