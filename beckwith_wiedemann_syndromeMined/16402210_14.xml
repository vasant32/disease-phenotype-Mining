<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both TNDM and BWS may be caused by aberrant loss of methylation (LOM) at imprinted loci on chromosomes 6q24 and 11p15.5 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe two patients with a clinical diagnosis of TNDM caused by LOM at the maternally methylated imprinted domain on 6q24; in addition, these patients had LOM at the centromeric differentially methylated region of 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This shows that imprinting anomalies can affect more than one imprinted locus and may alter the clinical presentation of imprinted disease </plain></SENT>
