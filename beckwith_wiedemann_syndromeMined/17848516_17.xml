<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An early example was the report of a transient, spatial convergence (&lt; or =2 microm) of oppositely imprinted regions ("kissing"), including the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>/Prader-Willi syndrome (AS/PWS) locus and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> locus in human lymphocytes during late S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was argued that kissing is required for maintaining opposite imprints in cycling cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Employing 3D-FISH with a BAC contig covering the AS/PWS region, light optical, serial sectioning, and quantitative 3D-image analysis, we observed that both loci always retained a compact structure and did not form giant loops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional distances measured among various, homologous AS/PWS segments in 393 human lymphocytes, 132 human fibroblasts, and 129 lymphoblastoid cells from Gorilla gorilla revealed a wide range of distances at any stage of interphase and in G(0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At late S phase, 4% of nuclei showed distances &lt; or =2 microm, 49% showed distances &gt;6 microm, and 18% even showed distances &gt;8 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar distance variability was found for Homo sapiens (HSA) 15 centromeres in a PWS patient with a deletion of the maternal AS/PWS locus and for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> loci in human lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A transient kiss during late S phase between loci widely separated at other stages of the cell cycle seems incompatible with known global constraints of chromatin movements in cycling cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further experiments suggest that the previously observed convergence of AS/PWS loci during late S phase was most likely a side effect of the convergence of nucleolus organizer region-bearing acrocentric human chromosomes, including HSA 15 </plain></SENT>
