<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mammalian imprinted genes are frequently arranged in clusters on particular chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The imprinting cluster on human chromosome 11p15 is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) and a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the genomic organization of the imprinted cluster, an extensive screen for differentially expressed transcripts in the 11p15 region was performed using monochromosomal hybrids with a paternal or maternal human chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe an imprinted antisense transcript identified within the KvLQT1 locus, which is associated with multiple balanced chromosomal rearrangements in BWS and an additional breakpoint in embryonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206743" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rhabdoid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transcript, called LIT1 (long QT intronic transcript 1), was expressed preferentially from the paternal allele and produced in most human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation analysis revealed that an intronic CpG island was specifically methylated on the silent maternal allele and that four of 13 BWS patients showed complete loss of maternal methylation at the CpG island, suggesting that antisense regulation is involved in the development of human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that eight of eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumors</z:e> exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imprinting of LIT1 and five of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> displayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> differential methylation at the intronic CpG island </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with five of six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showing loss of imprinting of IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the imprinted gene domain at the KvLQT1 locus is discordantly regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> from the imprinted domain at the IGF2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, this positional approach using human monochromosomal hybrids could contribute to the efficient identification of imprinted loci in humans </plain></SENT>
