<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> is complex, but recently compiled family data suggest that it is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait of varying expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has previously been suggested that major rearrangements on the short arm of chromosome 11 may be involved in the aetiology of the disease, particularly in the region of the insulin like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene (11p15.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This gene is thought to be parentally imprinted in the mouse and it has been suggested that in the human, duplication of the non-imprinted locus in WBS patient might lead to diploid expression of the gene and consequent general <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This model predicts that there should be both frequent and parental origin specific duplication of the IGF-II gene in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was the aim of this study to examine the IGF-II locus and its surrounding chromosomal environment for such lesions in a large number of WBS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for four linked markers on 11p and genomic clones internal to the IGF-II locus we could find no evidence of alteration or amplification of this area in any of the 11 patients investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient who developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms tumour</z:e> we could find no evidence for loss of any material on the short arm of chromosome 11 as reported previously.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
