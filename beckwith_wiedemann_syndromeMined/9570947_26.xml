<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human chromosomal band 11p15.5 has been shown to contain genes involved in the development of several pediatric and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overlapping P1 artificial chromosome clones from this region have been used as templates for genomic sequencing in an effort to identify candidate genes for these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PowerBLAST identified several matches with expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from fetal brain and liver cDNA libraries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis indicated that two of the genes identified by these ESTs encode transcripts of 1-1.5 kb with predominant expression in fetal and adult liver and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With RT-PCR and RACE, full-length transcripts were isolated for these two genes, with the largest open reading frames encoding putative proteins of 253 and 424 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Database comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the larger transcript indicated homology to integral membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25697">organic cation</z:chebi> transporters; hence, we designate this gene ORCTL2 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25697">organic cation</z:chebi> transporter-like 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An expressed sequence polymorphism provided evidence that the ORCTL2 gene exhibits "leaky" imprinting in both human fetal kidney and human fetal liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mouse orthologue (Orctl2) was identified, and a similar polymorphism was used to demonstrate maternal-specific expression of this gene in fetal liver from interspecific F1 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predicted protein of the smaller gene showed no significant similarity in the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Northern and RACE analyses suggest that this gene may have multiple transcription start sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Determination of the genomic structure in humans indicated that the 5'-end of this transcript overlaps in divergent orientation with the first two exons of ORCTL2, suggesting a possible role for antisense regulation of one gene by the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, provisionally name this second transcript ORCTL2S (ORCTL2-antisense) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expression patterns of these genes and the imprinted expression of ORCTL2 are suggestive of a possible role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> (WT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although SSCP analysis of 62 WT samples and 10 BWS patients did not result in the identification of any mutations in ORCTL2 or ORCTL2S, it will be important to examine their expression pattern in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and BWS patients, since epigenetic alteration at these loci may play a role in the etiology of these diseases </plain></SENT>
