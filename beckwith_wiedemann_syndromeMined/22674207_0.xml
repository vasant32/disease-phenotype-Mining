<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is an increased incidence of rare imprinting disorders associated with assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identification of epigenetic changes at imprinted loci in ART infants has led to the suggestion that the techniques themselves may predispose embryos to acquire imprinting errors and diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is still unknown at what point(s) these imprinting errors arise, or the risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 2009 we conducted a Japanese nationwide epidemiological study of four well-known imprinting diseases to determine any association with ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing, we examine the DNA methylation status of 22 gametic differentially methylated regions (gDMRs) located within the known imprinted loci in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS, n=1) and also Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS, n= 5) born after ART, and compared these with patients conceived naturally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a 10-fold increased frequency of BWS and SRS associated with ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of ART cases showed aberrant DNA methylation patterns at multiple imprinted loci both maternal and paternal gDMRs (5/6), with both hyper- and hypomethylation events (5/6) and also mosaic methylation errors (5/6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although our study may have been limited by a small sample number, the fact that many of the changes were mosaic suggested that they occurred after fertilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, few of the patients who were conceived naturally exhibited a similar pattern of mosaic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differences in methylation patterns between the patients who were conceived naturally or after ART did not manifest due to the differences in the disease phenotypes in these imprinting disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A possible association between ART and BWS/SRS was found, and we observed a more widespread disruption of genomic imprints after ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increased frequency of imprinting disorders after ART is perhaps not surprising given the major epigenetic events that take place during early development at a time when the epigenome is most vulnerable </plain></SENT>
