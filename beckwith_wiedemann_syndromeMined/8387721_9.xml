<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a high-resolution radiation hybrid (RH) map of the distal short arm of human chromosome 11 containing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> gene and the associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">embryonal tumor</z:e> disease loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen human 11p15 genes and 17 new anonymous probes were mapped by a statistical analysis of the cosegregation of markers in 102 rodent-human radiation hybrids retaining fragments of human chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 17 anonymous probes were generated from lambda phage containing human 11p15.5 inserts, by using ALU-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive map of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 loci and a framework map of nine clusters of loci ordered at odds of 1,000:1 were constructed by a multipoint maximum-likelihood approach by using the computer program RHMAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This RH map localizes one new gene to chromosome 11p15 (WEE1), provides more precise order information for several 11p15 genes (CTSD, H19, HPX, ST5, RNH, and SMPD1), confirms previous map orders for other 11p15 genes (CALCA, PTH, HBBC, TH, HRAS, and DRD4), and maps 17 new anonymous probes within the 11p15.5 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This RH map should prove useful in better defining the positions of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">embryonal tumor</z:e> disease-gene loci </plain></SENT>
