<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of cases are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, but several families with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> with variable expression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>reduced penetrance</z:hpo> have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three such families, BWS has been linked to DNA markers for the insulin gene (INS) and H-ras on chromosome band 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two additional families with inherited BWS are described here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis has been performed with a highly informative marker for the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) locus within the INS-IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor II)-TH gene cluster and confirms the previous observed linkage to this region (lod score 2.16 at theta = 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis to TH provides a basis for informed genetic counselling and carrier detection in the hereditary form of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the hypothesis that IGF2 may be a candidate gene for BWS, we screened for mutations in the coding exons 7 and 9, but found no abnormalities in 5 unrelated BWS cases </plain></SENT>
