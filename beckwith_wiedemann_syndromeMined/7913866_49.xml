<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One chromosome region (BWSCR1) is near the insulin (INS) and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other region (BWSCR2) is more proximal near two sequences with zinc-binding finger motifs and a number of known and putative genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This latter region, at least, seems to be associated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly support the proposed involvement of parental imprinting in the etiology of BWS since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> balanced chromosomal abnormalities in these patients were maternally transmitted while the mothers were phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that such an autosomal balanced rearrangement can lead to a specific maternal hypomethylation of the INS/IGF2 genes localized distal to the breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This underlines the role of these genes in the etiology of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
