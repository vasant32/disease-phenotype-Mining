<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Porcine BM88 is a neuron-specific protein that enhances <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cell differentiation in vitro and may be involved in neuronal differentiation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the identification, by Western blotting, of homologous proteins in human and mouse brain and the isolation of their respective cDNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several human and mouse clones were identified in the EST database using porcine BM88 cDNA as a query </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A human and a mouse EST clone were chosen for sequencing and were found both to predict a protein of 149 amino acids, with 79.9% reciprocal identity, and 76.4% and 70.7% identities to the porcine protein, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This indicated that the clones corresponded to the human and mouse BM88 homologues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro expression in a cell-free system as well as transient expression in COS7 cells yielded <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> products that were recognized by anti-BM88 antibodies and were identical in size to the native BM88 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern-blot analysis showed a wide distribution of the gene in human brain whereas immunohistochemistry on human brain sections demonstrated that the expression of BM88 is confined to neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial mapping assignment of human BM88 to chromosome 11p15.5, a region implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, was retrieved from the UniGene database maintained at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We confirmed this localization by performing fluorescence in situ hybridization on BM88-positive cosmid clones isolated from a human genomic library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that BM88 may be a candidate gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> associated with alterations at 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
