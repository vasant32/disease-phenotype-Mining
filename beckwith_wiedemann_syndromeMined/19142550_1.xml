<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> is a disorder of somatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence of kidney <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> is a diagnostic criterion that may be used to help identify those patients who are at the greatest risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumors</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In such subjects, kidney size is typically larger than that of age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to generate a nomogram that could be used to measure renal dimensions in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> patients followed at our institution from 1996 to 2004 were eligible for inclusion in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Renal length was measured with a curvilinear transducer and with the patient supine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Renal lengths were measured for both kidneys using real-time ultrasound for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their data were compared with those of age-matched controls reported in the 1984 study by Rosenbaum et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-six children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> were followed from 1996 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-three of these patients met our criteria for inclusion in the study: 28 girls (65%) and 15 boys (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We identified a linear relationship between kidney length and patient age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences in renal length were found between boys and girls (p=0.2153) or between the kidneys on either side of the body (p=0.9613) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study provides a practical, simple renal growth chart that offers a reasonable, sensitive method for evaluating kidney size in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
