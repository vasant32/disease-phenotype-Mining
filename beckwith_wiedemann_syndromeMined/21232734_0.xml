<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 22-month-old infant, who was referred by his pediatrician at the age of 15 months for a corporeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> associated with hemihypertrichosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In his medical history, a second degree parental consanguinity and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000047'>hypospadias</z:hpo> in the father and a paternal uncle were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination found a weight and a size greater than chronological age (3 standard deviations), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> of entire left side with a difference of length and diameter between the left and right limbs of 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hemihypertrichosis was widespread in the left body and the genital examination found a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000047'>hypospadias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biological and radiological assessments did not show any abnormality, with the exception of an initially high plasma <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> level, which gradually normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the diagnosis of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> with congenital hemihypertrichosis was retained </plain></SENT>
