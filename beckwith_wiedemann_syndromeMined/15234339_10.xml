<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apart from other specific clinical features, severe intrauterine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo> are the dominant characteristics of SRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, studies on the genetic basis of the disease focus on genes involved in growth and its regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another key for the identification of (a) SRS gene(s) is the finding of chromosomal disturbances in SRS patients: recently, four growth retarded patients carrying duplications in 11p15 of maternal origin have been described, two of these cases presented SRS-like features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same region includes IGF2 and CDKN1C and is well known to harbour alterations in patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We therefore decided to perform an extensive search for variants in the IGF2 and CDKN1C genes; mutations in these genes cause growth disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 40 SRS patients were screened for mutations by different detection strategies, allele frequencies were compared between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both genes, we did not detect any obvious pathogenic mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In case of IGF2, slight differences in the allelic distribution of specific polymorphisms between SRS patients and controls were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In CDKN1C, several variants could be identified in both cohorts with similar frequencies, but only one patient showed a so far unknown variant not detectable in controls </plain></SENT>
