<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A recent study suggested a markedly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> (HB) among children conceived with treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether this finding is confounded by the association between HB and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> (LBW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Associations between parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> and its treatment and HB were examined using data from a case-control study conducted through the Children's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (COG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telephone interviews were completed for 383 mothers of cases diagnosed with HB at US COG institutions between January 2000 and December 2008 and for 387 mothers of controls recruited through state birth registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to examine possible associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for birthweight and other potential confounders, no significant association was found for any of the measures of parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> or its treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In HB cases conceived through assisted reproductive technology (ART), 4 of 16 also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) compared with 9 of 365 in HB cases without ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Little evidence of an association between parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> or its treatment and HB was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relationship found in a previous study could be due to LBW and BWS which are risk factors for HB and also associated with parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> and its treatment </plain></SENT>
