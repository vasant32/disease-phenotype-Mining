<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed several cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> in a familial setting, which give insight into the complex controls of imprinting and gene expression in the chromosome 11p15 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a 2.2-kbp microdeletion in the H19/insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)-imprinting center eliminating three target sites of the chromatin insulator protein CTCF that we believe here is necessary, but not sufficient, to cause BWS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the deletion is associated with IGF2 loss of imprinting and up-regulation of IGF2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in at least one affected family member a second genetic lesion (a duplication of maternal 11p15) was identified and accompanied by a further increase in IGF2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels 35-fold higher than control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the combined effects of the H19/IGF2-imprinting center microdeletion and 11p15 chromosome duplication were necessary for manifestation of BWS </plain></SENT>
