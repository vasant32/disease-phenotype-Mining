<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that three regions on chromosome 11p15 (BWSCR1, BWSCR2, and BWSCR3) may play a role in the development of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BWSCR2 is defined by two BWS breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the cloning and sequence analysis of 73 kb containing BWSCR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within this region, we detected a novel zinc-finger gene, ZNF215 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that two of its five alternatively spliced transcripts are disrupted by both BWSCR2 breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parts of the 3' end of these splice forms are transcribed from the antisense strand of a second zinc-finger gene, ZNF214 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that ZNF215 is imprinted in a tissue-specific manner </plain></SENT>
