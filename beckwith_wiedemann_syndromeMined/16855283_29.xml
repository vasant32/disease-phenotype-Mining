<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defining the extent and distribution of imprinting across genomes will be crucial for understanding the roles played by imprinting in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mammalian growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using mice carrying <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomies</z:mp> or duplications, microarray screening and stringent bioinformatics, we have developed the first large-scale tissue-specific screen for imprinted gene detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We quantify the stringency of our methodology and relate it to previous non-tissue-specific large-scale studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report the identification in mouse of four brain-specific novel paternally expressed transcripts and an additional three genes that show maternal expression in the placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regions of conserved linkage in the human genome are associated with the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome</z:e> (BWS) where imprinting is known to be a contributing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that large-scale systematic analyses of this genre are necessary for the full impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> on mammalian gene expression and phenotype to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
