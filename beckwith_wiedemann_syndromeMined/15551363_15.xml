<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many advanced urothelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi>) display downregulation of CDKN1C expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The responsible mechanisms were investigated in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> cell lines, with cultured <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> urothelial cells (UEC) as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CDKN1C <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was diminished in 12/15 TCC lines and p57(KIP2) protein was decreased accordingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because CDKN1C is expressed from the maternal allele only, LOH at 11p15.5 represents one mechanism of downregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 cell lines, several polymorphic markers flanking CDKN1C were homozygous compatible with this mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of the CDKN1C promoter, a reported cause of downregulation in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, was detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing in several cell lines and appeared associated with downregulation in at least one cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The methylation inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'deoxycytidine</z:chebi> induced CDKN1C expression in this cell line and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A third reported mechanism involves a switch of both alleles toward a <z:mp ids='MP_0003123'>paternal imprinting</z:mp> pattern, indicated by hypomethylation of a differentially methylated region (DMR) in the imprinting center (IC2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This hypomethylation was detected in most <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> lines, and was associated with re-expression of the non-coding LIT1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and with downregulation of CDKN1C in several </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, CDKN1C downregulation in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> seems to occur by several different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding and the ability of p57(KIP2) to induce senescence in urothelial cells make CDKN1C a good candidate for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor at 11p in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
