<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of identical twin pairs, mostly female, have been reported to be discordant for BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that the incidence of female monozygotic twins among patients with BWS is dramatically increased over that of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cluster of imprinted genes within 11p15 is thought to be coordinately regulated via the imprinted expression of KCNQ1OT1, which encodes an untranslated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In skin fibroblasts from five monozygotic twin pairs discordant for BWS, each affected twin had an imprinting defect at KCNQ1OT1 on 11p15, whereas the unaffected twin did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five additional monozygotic twin pairs, for whom only blood was available, also displayed an imprinting defect at KCNQ1OT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is possible that discordance for BWS in MZ twins is due to unequal splitting of the inner cell mass during twinning, thereby causing differential maintenance of imprinting at KCNQ1OT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, we propose that KCNQ1OT1 is especially vulnerable to a loss of imprinting event, caused by a lack of maintenance DNA methylation at a critical stage of preimplantation development, and that this loss of imprinting predisposes to twinning as well as to discordance for BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data underscore the importance of continued surveillance of children born following assisted reproductive technologies that impact the preimplantation embryo </plain></SENT>
