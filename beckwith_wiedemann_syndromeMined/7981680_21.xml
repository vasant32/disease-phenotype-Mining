<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IGF-II gene is prevalently expressed during prenatal development and its gene activity is regulated by <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, in that the allele inherited from the father is active and the allele inherited from the mother is inactive in most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IGF-II expression is activated in several types of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and an alteration of IGF-II imprinting has been described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that monoallelic expression of IGF-II gene is conserved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult muscle tissue whereas two or more copies of active IGF-II alleles, arising by either relaxation of imprinting or duplication of the active allele, are found in 9 out of 11 (82%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcomas</z:hpo> retaining heterozygosity at 11p15, regardless of the histological subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since IGF-II has been indicated as an autocrine growth factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> cells, these findings strongly suggest that acquisition of a double dosage of active IGF-II gene is an important step for the initiation or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">muscle tumors</z:e>, relaxation of imprinting seems to arise prevalently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcomas</z:hpo>, since we have detected only one case of partial reactivation of the maternal IGF-II allele out of 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100243'>leiomyosarcomas</z:hpo> tested </plain></SENT>
