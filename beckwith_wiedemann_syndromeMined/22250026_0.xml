<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the contribution of standard diagnostic tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> when clinical features are not suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data from clinical, laboratory, and imaging information from children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> seen at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center between 1997 and 2010 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>Macroglossia</z:hpo> was the main reason for consultation in 84 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified on initial examination as isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> (n = 24), provisional BWS (n = 36), and syndromic (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A final diagnosis was reached in 74 patients, and in 10 patients the reason for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> remained undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the elucidated cases, BWS was the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> (39/84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of the 24 patients in the isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> group had an abnormal molecular test for BWS (P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen diagnostic conditions were confirmed in this study, and 42% of the population had a specific diagnosis that was not BWS (35/84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results can be used to improve our strategy in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Distinction between isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> and BWS may be difficult when only taking into account clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with apparently isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> have at least initial evaluation with abdominal ultrasounds and molecular studies for BWS before a final diagnosis is given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BWS was the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> even in the absence of additional clinical findings </plain></SENT>
