<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human p57KIP2 gene is located in chromosome 11p15.5, a region implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here report that p57KIP2 physically interacts with and inhibits c-Jun <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The carboxyl-terminal QT domain of p57KIP2 is crucial for the inhibition of JNK/SAPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpressed p57KIP2 also suppressed UV- and MEKK1-induced apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p57KIP2 expression during C2C12 myoblast differentiation resulted in repression of the JNK activity stimulated by UV light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, UV-stimulated JNK1 activity was higher in mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from p57-/- mice than in the cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggest that p57KIP2 modulates stress-activated signaling by functioning as an endogenous inhibitor of JNK/SAPK </plain></SENT>
