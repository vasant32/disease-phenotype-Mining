<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An infant with dysmorphic features of this syndrome had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> since birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nodular lesions were present in the right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphologically these lesions were composed of hypertrophic myocardial fibers admixed with multinucleated giant cells of myogenic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exact nature of these lesions remains undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that hypertrophic myocardial cells may represent cardiac cytomegaly as a manifestation of the accelerated growth potential of cells seen with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
