<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) have a risk of 7.5% to 10% of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumors</z:e>, 60% of which are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation of two distinct clusters of imprinted genes on chromosome 11p15 is detected in approximately 70% of BWS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine associations between the imprinting status of both imprinting clusters (BWSIC1/2) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> incidence and type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Methylation patterns of H19 and KCNQ1OT1 were collected in 114 patients with BWS with a clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed until 5 years of age, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> incidence and type were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A lower risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumors</z:e> was found among patients with a methylation defect limited to BWSIC2 compared with other patients with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumors</z:e> were found in this group, whereas in patients with a methylation defect limited to BWSIC1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> was the most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333132" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In addition to clinical factors indicative for a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> risk (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo>, nephromegaly), methylation patterns discriminate between patients with BWS with a high and low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also is possible to predict whether they are at risk of developing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Epigenotyping of patients is important to select the type of screening protocol to be proposed to these patients </plain></SENT>
