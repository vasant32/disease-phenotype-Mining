<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic phenomena play a key role in regulating gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the most widely studied epigenetic modification is DNA methylation at <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> residues of CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in gene promoters, transposons and imprinting control regions (ICR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>Genomic imprinting</z:mp> refers to epigenetic marking of genes that results in monoallelic expression depending on the parental origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several genes encoding key hormones involved in embryonic and fetal growth are imprinted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are two critical periods of epigenetic reprogramming: gametogenesis and early preimplantation development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major reprogramming takes place in primordial germ cells, in which parental imprints are erased and totipotency is restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imprint marks are then re-established during spermatogenesis or oogenesis, depending on gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upon fertilization, genome-wide demethylation is followed by a wave of de novo methylation, both processes being resisted by imprinted loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disruption of imprinting can cause growth defects such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome (BWS) and the Russell-Silver (RSS) intrauterine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These growth disorders are caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0008877'>abnormal DNA methylation</z:mp> in the 11p15 imprinted region encompassing many imprinted genes, such as IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BWS has been linked to loss of methylation (LOM) in the centromeric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e>/KCNQIOT1 region of the maternal allele, or gain of methylation in the telomeric ICR1/IGF2/H19 region of the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This latter epigenetic defect is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LOM in the telomeric ICR1 region of the paternal allele has been detected in RSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early embryogenesis is a critical period of epigenetic regulation, and is sensitive to environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Individuals conceived with the help of assisted reproductive technology (ART) are over-represented among BWS patients, suggesting that ART may favor altered imprinting at the imprinted centromeric 11p15 locus (LOM in the maternally methylated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> region) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The underlying cause of these imprinting defects, both spontaneous and ART-related, is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, recent data show that, in patients with BWS or RSS, including those conceived with the help of ART the DNA methylation defect involves imprinted loci other than 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This suggests that unfaithful maintenance of DNA methylation marks following fertilization involves dysregulation of a trans-acting regulatory factor </plain></SENT>
