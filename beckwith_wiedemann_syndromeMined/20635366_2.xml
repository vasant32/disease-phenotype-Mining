<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This patient cohort represents typical referrals to a regional genetic centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methylation analysis was performed at 13 imprinted loci [PLAGL1, IGF2R, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MEST</z:e>, GRB10, H19, IGF2 DMR2 (IGF2P0), KCNQ1OT1 (KvDMR), MEG3, SNRPN, PEG3, GNAS (GNAS exon 1a and NESP55) and GNASAS] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total 6/90 (6.67%) were shown to have a methylation defect, 2 of which were associated with known imprinting disorders: 1 patient had isolated hypomethylation at IGF2P0, an atypical epigenotype associated with Russell-Silver syndrome, and 1 showed hypomethylation at KvDMR consistent with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A further 4 patients, 3 exhibiting complete hypermethylation, and 1 partial hypomethylation, had aberrations at IGF2R, the clinical significance of which remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the potential utility of epigenetic investigation in routine diagnostic testing </plain></SENT>
