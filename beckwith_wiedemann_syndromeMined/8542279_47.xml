<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Meiotic recombination events do not occur randomly along a chromosome, but appear to be restricted to specific regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, some regions in the genome undergo recombination more frequently in the germ cells of one sex than the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>Genomic imprinting</z:mp>, the process by which the two parental alleles of a gene are differentially marked, is another genetic phenomenon associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> from only one parent or the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms that control meiotic recombination and <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> are unknown, but both phenomena necessarily depend on the presence of some DNA signal sequences and/or on the structure of the surrounding chromatin domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the present study, we compared the frequencies of sex-specific recombination events in three chromosomal regions of the human genome that contain clustered imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alignment of the genetic and physical maps of the ZNF127-SNRPN-IPW-PAR-5-PAR-1 region on chromosome 15q11-q13 (associated with Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>) and the IGF2-H19 region on chromosome 11p15.5 (associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>) shows that both regions recombine with very high frequency during male meiosis, and with very low frequency during female meiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A third region around the WT-1 gene on chromosome 11p13 also recombines with higher frequency during male meiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the two best-known imprinted regions in the human genome are characterized by significant differences in recombination frequency during male and female meioses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A third, less well-characterized, imprinted region shows a similar sex-specific bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these observations, we propose a model suggesting that the region-specific differential accessibility of DNA that leads to differential recombination rates during male and female meioses also leads to the male- and female-specific modification of the signal sequences that control <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
