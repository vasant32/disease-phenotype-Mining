<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Standard diagnostic tests for these syndromes include methylation analysis of the differential methylated regions of the H19 and KCNQ1OT1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Traditionally this has been conducted by Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCR-based methods greatly improve the turn around time of the test and require less DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the newly emerging techniques for SNP genotyping and mutation scanning, high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, has been shown to be also applicable for methylation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested methylation-sensitive HRM analysis as a method for the detection of methylation defects in a group of 16 BWS and SRS patients with known methylation status (determined previously by Southern blotting), as well as 45 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HRM analysis was able to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> methylation aberrations in the patients and appeared to be more sensitive than Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls is minimal and the presence of SNPs in the amplified fragment does not influence the outcome of the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that methylation-sensitive HRM analysis is a robust, fast, sensitive and cost effective method for methylation analysis in BWS and SRS </plain></SENT>
