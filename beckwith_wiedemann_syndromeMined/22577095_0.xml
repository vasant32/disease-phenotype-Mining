<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most patients with epigenetic changes at H19-DMR, the timing of and mechanism mediating GOM is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify this, we analyzed methylation at the imprinting control regions of somatic tissues and the placenta from two unrelated, naturally conceived patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maternal H19-DMR was abnormally and variably hypermethylated in both patients, indicating epigenetic mosaicism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation levels were consistently lower in placenta than in blood and skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mosaic and discordant methylation strongly suggested that aberrant hypermethylation occurred after implantation, when genome-wide de novo methylation normally occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We expect aberrant de novo hypermethylation of H19-DMR happens to a greater extent in embryos than in placentas, as this is normally the case for de novo methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, of 16 primary imprinted DMRs analyzed, only H19-DMR was aberrantly methylated, except for NNAT DMR in the placental <z:hpo ids='HP_0100883'>chorangioma</z:hpo> of Patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, these are the first data suggesting when GOM of H19-DMR occurs </plain></SENT>
