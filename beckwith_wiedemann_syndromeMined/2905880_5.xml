<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the genes located in 11p15, c-Ha-ras 1 (HRAS1), insulin (INS), and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) may account for the clinical features and the increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using eight 11p15 markers including HRAS1, INS and IGF2 we have studied eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and hereditary cases of BWS whether or not associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By gene dosage determination and family studies, we have shown the following: the eight patients examined had an apparent diploid representation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the eight markers studied, thus indicating that a microduplication of these markers or of the region characterized by these markers is not a common event in BWS; in a family with three affected sibs the genes for HRAS1 and INS/IGF2 did not cosegregate with BWS and therefore may not participate in the pathogenic processes here observed </plain></SENT>
