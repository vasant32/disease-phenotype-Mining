<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can do so because the epigenetic state varies among tissues and during a lifetime, whereas the DNA sequence remains essentially the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As cells adapt to a changing internal and external environment, epigenetic mechanisms can remember these changes in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> programming and reprogramming of gene activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The common disease genetic and epigenetic (CDGE) model provides an epidemiologic framework that can incorporate epigenetic with genetic variation in the context of age-related susceptibility to disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under CDGE, the epigenetic program can modify the effects of deleterious genes or may be influenced by an adverse environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, including epigenetics into epidemiologic studies of human disease may help explain the relationship between the genome and the environment and may provide new clues to modifying these effects in disease prevention and therapy </plain></SENT>
