<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the strong link between H19 hypermethylation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> risk, several diagnostic laboratories only test for hypomethylation of LIT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the added diagnostic value of combined LIT1 and H19 testing in a large series of referred samples from 1298 patients, including 53 well-characterized patients from the St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Louis Children's Hospital BWS-Registry (validation samples) and 1245 consecutive nationwide referrals (practice samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methylation-sensitive enzymatic digestion with Southern hybridization assessed loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the validation group, abnormal LIT1 hypomethylation was detected in 60% (32/52) of patients but LIT1/H19-combined testing was abnormal in 68% (36/53); sensitivity in the practice setting demonstrated 27% (342/1245) abnormal LIT1 and 32% (404/1245) abnormal LIT1/H19-combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, H19 methylation was abnormal in 7% of LIT1-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) in 27% of combined LIT1/H19-abnormal samples, diagnostic of multilocus methylation abnormalities; in contrast to studies implicating that combined LIT1/H19 abnormalities are diagnostic of UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall low detection rate, even in validated patient samples and despite characterization of both loci and UPD status, emphasizes the importance of clinical diagnosis in BWS </plain></SENT>
