<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the first SRS patients with (epi)genetic mutations in 11p15 affecting the telomeric imprinting domain have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, opposite mutations are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the general significance of epigenetic mutations in 11p15 for the aetiology of SRS remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened a cohort of 51 SRS patients for epimutations in ICR1 and KCNQ1OT1 by methylation sensitive Southern blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ICR1 demethylation could be observed in 16 of the 51 SRS patients, corresponding to a frequency of approximately 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in methylation at the KCNQ1OT1 locus were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Combining these data with those on maternal duplications in 11p15, nearly 35% of SRS cases are associated with detectable (epi)genetic disturbances in 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We now have to also consider a general involvement of 11p15 alterations in growth retarded patients with only minor or without further dysmorphic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SRS and BWS may now be regarded as two diseases caused by opposite (epi)genetic disturbances of the same chromosomal region displaying opposite clinical pictures </plain></SENT>
