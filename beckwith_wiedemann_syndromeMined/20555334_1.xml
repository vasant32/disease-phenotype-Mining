<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether these changes are also present in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes, although the presence of small-scale CNVs (such as duplication of 11p15 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>), excessive cell proliferation and an increased frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> been reported in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present results of a genome-wide scan for LOH and CNV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085261" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Proteus syndrome (PS)</z:e>, a severely disfiguring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated CNV and LOH in DNA derived from affected and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue samples from six PS patients using Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 250â€‰K Nsp high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis revealed that LOH and CNVs were not common in PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We attempted to validate selected CNVs detected by microarray analysis using quantitative genomic PCR, but the observed changes were not confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that large-scale genome-wide CNVs and LOH as seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> syndromes are not characteristic findings in PS, although we cannot rule out the possibility that newer arrays with a higher number of probes could uncover smaller CNVs not detected in this study </plain></SENT>
