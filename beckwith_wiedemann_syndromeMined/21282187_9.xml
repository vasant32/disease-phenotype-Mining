<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation of the ICR controls the reciprocal imprinting of IGF2 and H19 by preventing the binding of the insulator protein, CTCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here show that local changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications and CTCF--cohesin binding at the ICR in BWS and SRS together with DNA methylation correlate with the higher order chromatin structure at the locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In lymphoblastoid cells from control individuals, we found the repressive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 marks associated with the methylated paternal ICR allele and the bivalent H3K4me2/H3K27me3 mark together with H3K9ac and CTCF--cohesin associated with the non-methylated maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patient-derived cell lines, the mat/pat asymmetric distribution of these epigenetic marks was lost with H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 becoming biallelic in the BWS and H3K4me2, H3K27me3 and H3K9ac together with CTCF-cohesin becoming biallelic in the SRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further show that in BWS and SRS cells, there is opposing chromatin looping conformation mediated by CTCF--cohesin binding sites surrounding the locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, lack of CTCF--cohesin binding at the paternal ICR is associated with monoallelic interaction between two CTCF sites flanking the locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTCF--cohesin binding at the maternal ICR blocks this interaction by associating with the CTCF site downstream of the enhancers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two alternative chromatin conformations are differently favoured in BWS and SRS likely predisposing the locus to the activation of IGF2 or H19, respectively </plain></SENT>
