<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a case-control study in children with BWS to examine whether nephromegaly increases the risk of WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The BWS Registry was used to identify control and case patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control patients were defined as children with BWS who were older than 6 years and had no imaging evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> or previous WT and for whom complete records were available; 31 patients met these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case patients were defined as children with BWS who had WT and screening renal imaging before the diagnosis of WT; 12 of these patients had serial screening images before diagnosis of WT and comprised the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only renal images obtained before the diagnosis of WT was made were used to assess renal length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients with WT had nephromegaly (&gt; or =95th percentile of age adjusted renal length) on serial screening studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only four of 31 control patients (specificity = 86%) had nephromegaly resulting in an odds ratio of 72 (95% confidence interval = 13-391) for the risk of WT with nephromegaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with BWS, persistent nephromegaly is a strong risk factor for the development of WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If screening for WT is done in this population, infants with nephromegaly should be considered those at greatest risk for WT, and screening may be best targeted at this group </plain></SENT>
