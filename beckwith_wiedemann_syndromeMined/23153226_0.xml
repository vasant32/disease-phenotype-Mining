<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) is a loss-of-imprinting pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary features of BWS include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondary features that are frequently observed in BWS patients are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus flammeus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003271'>visceromegaly</z:hpo>, hemihyperplasia, cardiac malformations, and difficulty breathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BWS is speculated to occur primarily as the result of the misregulation of imprinted genes associated with two clusters on chromosome 11p15.5, namely the KvDMR1 and H19/IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> phenotype is observed in bovine and ovine as a result of embryo culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ruminants this syndrome is known as large offspring syndrome (LOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes associated with LOS are <z:mp ids='MP_0009673'>increased birth weight</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003271'>visceromegaly</z:hpo>, skeletal defects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo>, and breathing difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even though phenotypic similarities exist between the two syndromes, whether the two syndromes are epigenetically similar is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study we use control Bos taurus indicus X Bos taurus taurus F1 hybrid bovine concepti to characterize baseline imprinted gene expression and DNA methylation status of imprinted domains known to be misregulated in BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This work is intended to be the first step in a series of experiments aimed at determining if LOS will serve as an appropriate animal model to study BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The use of F1 B. t. indicus x B. t. taurus tissues provided us with a tool to unequivocally determine imprinted status of the regions of interest in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found that imprinting is conserved between the bovine and human in imprinted genes known to be associated with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>KCNQ1OT1 and PLAGL1 were paternally-expressed while CDKN1C and H19 were maternally-expressed in B. t. indicus x B. t. taurus F1 concepti </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We also show that in bovids, differential methylation exists at the KvDMR1 and H19/IGF2 ICRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings we conclude that the imprinted gene expression of KCNQ1OT1, CDKN1C, H19, and PLAGL1 and the methylation patterns at the KvDMR1 and H19/IGF2 ICRs are conserved between human and bovine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future work will determine if LOS is associated with misregulation at these imprinted loci, similarly to what has been observed for BWS </plain></SENT>
