<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We confirm that most patients with WBS do well and that their clinical abnormalities become less apparent with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We suggest that there is a characteristic neonatal appearance in WBS and that the expected pattern of facial growth generally results in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance by mid- to late childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tentatively propose that there is a distinct facial anthropometric pattern profile in WBS </plain></SENT>
