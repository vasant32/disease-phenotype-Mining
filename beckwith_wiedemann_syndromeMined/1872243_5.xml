<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cystic masses were discovered either prenatally by using sonography or early in the neonatal period as palpable flank masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imaging studies, including sonography and CT, could not confidently exclude <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the masses were removed surgically, histologic examination showed them <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> to be benign hemorrhagic macrocysts within the capsule or permanent cortex (in contrast to neonatal adrenal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, which usually occurs more centrally in the fetal cortex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were as large as 8 cm in diameter, and in one case a solitary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> was predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>Hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of the six lesions were right-sided, and there was a male-female ratio of 5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Benign hemorrhagic adrenocortical macrocysts are a cause of abdominal mass in the fetus and neonate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
