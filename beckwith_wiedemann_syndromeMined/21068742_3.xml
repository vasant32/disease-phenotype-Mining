<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed methylation analysis for 18 differentially methylated regions on various chromosomes, genome-wide microsatellite analysis for a total of 90 loci and expression analysis of SNRPN in leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, she was found to have an androgenetic 46,XX cell lineage and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 46,XX cell lineage, with the frequency of the androgenetic cells being roughly calculated as 91% in leukocytes, 70% in tongue tissues and 79% in tonsil tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is likely that, after a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fertilization between an ovum and a sperm, the paternally derived pronucleus alone, but not the maternally derived pronucleus, underwent a mitotic division, resulting both in the generation of the androgenetic cell lineage by endoreplication of one blastomere containing a paternally derived pronucleus and in the formation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell lineage by union of paternally and maternally derived pronuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It appears that the extent of overall (epi)genetic aberrations exceeded the threshold level for the development of BWS-like and upd(14)pat-like phenotypes, but not for the occurrence of other imprinting disorders or recessive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Mendelian disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
