<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hallmark of these modifications is DNA methylation at <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> residues of CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in gene promoters, transposons and imprinting control regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>Genomic imprinting</z:mp> refers to an epigenetic marking of genes that results in monoallelic expression depending on their parental origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are two critical time periods in epigenetic reprogramming: gametogenesis and early preimplantation development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major reprogramming takes place in primordial germ cells in which parental imprints are erased and totipotency is restored [1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imprint marks are then and re-established during spermatogenesis or oogenesis, depending on sex [1-3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon fertilization, genome-wide demethylation occurs followed by a wave of de novo methylation, both of which are resisted by imprinted loci [4] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic patterns are usually faithfully maintained during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this maintenance sometimes fails, resulting in the disturbance of epigenetic patterns and human disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For example, two fetal growth disorders, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> (BWS) and the Silver-Russell (SRS) syndromes with opposite phenotypes, are caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0008877'>abnormal DNA methylation</z:mp> at the 11p15 imprinted locus [5-7]: respectively loss of methylation at the Imprinting Region Center (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e>) or gain of methylation at ICR1 in BWS and loss of methylation at ICR1 in SRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early embryogenesis is a critical time for epigenetic regulation, and this process is sensitive to environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has been shown to induce epigenetic alterations and to affect fetal growth and development [8-11] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In humans, several imprinting disorders, including BWS, occur at significantly higher frequencies in children conceived with the use of ART than in children conceived spontaneously [12,13] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cause of these epigenetic imprinting disorders (following ART, unfertility causes, hormonal hyperstimulation, in vitro fertilization-IVF, Intracytoplasmic sperm injection-ICSI, micro-manipulation of gametes, exposure to culture medium, in vitro ovocyte maturation, time of transfer) remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, recent data have shown that in patients with BWS or SRS, including those born following the use of ART, the DNA methylation defect involves imprinted loci other than 11p15 [14,15] (11p15 region: CTCF binding sites at ICR1, H19 and IGF2 DMRs, KCNQ1OT1 [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e>], SNRPN [chromosome 15 q11-13], <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>/MEST1 [chromosome 7q31], IGF type2 receptor and ZAC1 [chromosome 6q26 et 6q24 respectively], DLK1/GTL2-IG-DMR [chromosome 14q32] and GNAS locus [chromosome 20q13.3]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This suggests that unfaithful maintenance of DNA methylation marks following fertilization involves the dysregulation of a trans-acting regulatory factor that could be altered by ART </plain></SENT>
