<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cDNA clones with different sizes were obtained, which share a potential ORF of 399bp and are different in their 3' untranslated regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This gene was revealed to be expressed exclusively in human heart and in almost no other tissues examined by northern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two transcripts of different sizes, 0.9 and 3.1kb, were identified in heart, consistent with the length of the two cDNA clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene shows biallelic expression (non-imprinted) in fetal liver, although it is located in the imprinted domain of 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C11orf21 codes a protein of 132 amino acids as proved by the expression of C11orf21-EGFP fusion protein in cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EGFP-fusion protein expressed in cultured cells localized mainly in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
