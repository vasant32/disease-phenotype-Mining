<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) are at increased risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> (WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms Tumor</z:hpo> Study Group (NWTSG) records to assess clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with WT and BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the NWTSG, treating clinicians were asked to report, for each enrolled patient, whether the patient had BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between 1980 and 1995, 4,669 patients were treated on two consecutive NWTSG protocols (NWTS 3 and NWTS 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of BWS patients compared with patients with WT without BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-three children enrolled onto NWTS 3 and 4 were reported to have BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BWS patients were more likely to present with lower-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P =.0001), with more than half (27 of 53) presenting with stage I disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall treatment outcomes for the BWS patients were nearly identical to those without BWS, with overall survival at 4 years from diagnosis at 89% and 90%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 21% of the patients with BWS had bilateral disease, either at diagnosis (nine of 53) or as metachronous contralateral recurrence (two of 53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BWS patients enrolled onto NWTS 4 had smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> than those enrolled onto NWTS 3 (P =.02), a trend not seen in the non-BWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Like children without BWS, children with BWS and WT have an excellent prognosis with modern treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is a high risk of bilateral disease, and increasingly smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are being detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a national trial assessing the role of ultrasound screening followed by nephron-sparing surgery for some patients may be appropriate </plain></SENT>
