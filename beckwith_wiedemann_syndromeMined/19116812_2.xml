<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated p57 immunohistochemical expression in placental vascular proliferative disorders of preterm and term placentas, including chorangiosis (n = 5), chorangiomatosis (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100883'>chorangiomas</z:hpo> (n = 7), umbilical cord <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> (n = 1), and placental mesenchymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (PMD) (n = 7) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The loss of p57 expression in PMD could be of diagnostic value in helping to distinguish this rare placental lesion from its mimickers </plain></SENT>
