<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases are documented, and three previously reported MZ twin pairs are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic concordance for this syndrome in MZ twin pairs has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many cases of familial occurrence have been published and different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>modes of inheritance</z:hpo> have been postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the twin-twin variability seen in our patients, it seems the most likely mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> mutation with environmental modification of expressivity, or reduced phenotrance </plain></SENT>
