<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mouse distal chromosome 7 contains a cluster of at least five imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The syntenic region in humans, at 11p15.5, has been implicated in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the imprinted status of the genes in the region, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> are each associated with loss of maternal information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also mapping to 11p15.5 are long QT and Jervell and Lange-Nielsen (JLN) syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to BWS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo>, these syndromes do not show any parent of origin bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently positional cloning has identified KVLQT1 as the 11p15.5 gene responsible for increased susceptibility to long QT and JLN syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other studies associate KVLQT1 with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Human KVLQT1 is paternally imprinted in embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study we present a contig and transcript map of distal mouse 7 and we physically and genetically map mouse Kvlqt1 to the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mouse Kvlqt1 is strongly expressed in heart, lung, gut, kidney and uterus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While its early developmental expression is maternal in origin, the paternal allele becomes increasingly active during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Late juvenile and adult animals show complete biallelism, suggesting an explanation for the lack of parent of origin bias in JLN and long QT </plain></SENT>
