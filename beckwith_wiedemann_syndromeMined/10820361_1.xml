<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, the authors revealed that certain patients with childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> had had rapid somatic growth after birth, suggesting the involvement of growth factor(s) in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the authors examined whether relaxation of IGF-2 imprinting occurred in infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The genomic DNA of infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>, and control individuals was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had heterozygous genotype were selected as informative cases using Apa I polymorphism in exon 9 of the IGF-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was isolated from informative cases, followed by cDNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>cDNA was amplified by PCR, and direct sequence was performed for determining allele specific transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty of 22 infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> blasts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monoallelic expression of IGF-2 as well as 23 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The height and weight of two <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> patients with LOI were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges for Japanese children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current study revealed that the imprinting status of IGF-2 was generally maintained in infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and confirmed that it was maintained in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that LOI of IGF-2 does not play a major role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of these diseases or in rapid physical growth of the patients </plain></SENT>
