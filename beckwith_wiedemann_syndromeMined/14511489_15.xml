<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are, in the broadest sense, two mechanisms by which gene expression can be extinguished in vertebrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first of these is based on mass action effects of positive and negative regulatory factors and is termed activation and repression; the second is independent of positive regulatory factors but is based on the history of the affected gene and is termed silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can be said, again in the broadest sense, that imprinted genes, genes subject to X inactivation, and transposon promoters are subject to silencing, while the promoters of tissue-specific genes in non-expressing tissues are controlled by activation and repression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The escape of imprinted genes from silencing through unknown mechanisms can cause developmental abnormalities and can predispose to the formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">embryonal tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorder</z:e> caused by loss of imprinting of genes on chromosome 11p15.5 is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This syndrome has long been known to be inexplicably common in monozygotic twins; the twins are nearly always discordant for BWS, and nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> twins are female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A loss of imprinting model based on stochastic errors in the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, or a paternally expressed function that opposes maintenance methylation of maternally repressed growth-enhancing genes, is proposed to explain the perplexing genetics of BWS in monozygotic twins </plain></SENT>
