<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whilst changes in gene dosage in this area do not appear to be common in the syndrome, in familial cases the lesion appears to be dominant only when inherited through the female line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook to examine the parental origin of the copies of chromosome 11 in a large group of WBS patients using a series of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) on 11p, and report here that in one <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case of WBS out of 14 both copies of chromosome 11 are derived from the father and are present in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that at least one mode of expression of the lesion is modified by <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
