<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome</z:e> (BWS) is a <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> disorder characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (OS) pattern of our patients with BWS and administered, for the first time, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> (PAR) once a day as long-term therapy in order to correct the effects induced by free radicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the clinical features of three patients examined every three months in our clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OS was ascertained by measuring a panel of OS biomarkers: non-protein-binding iron, total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35923,35924">hydroperoxides</z:chebi>, advanced oxidation protein products, isoprostanes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23019">carbonyl groups</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiols</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the presence of OS was established, treatment with PAR was started at the dosage of 300 mg of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">Potassium</z:chebi> Bicarbonate and 150 mg of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">Ascorbic Acid</z:chebi> in aqueous solution and changes occurring in OS biomarkers were followed dosing every three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our patients showed higher levels of OS biomarkers than controls at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a reduction in OS biomarker values for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients with treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No primary or secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e> was observed in 9 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first report showing OS occurring in BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No drug until this report has been published showing efficacy against OS in any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the limited number of patients, care must be taken to mitigate enthusiasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We are collecting data for a large number of BWS patients to confirm these preliminary results </plain></SENT>
