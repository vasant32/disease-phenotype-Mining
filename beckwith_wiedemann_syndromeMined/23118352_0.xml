<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>At chromosome 11p15.5, the Imprinting Centre 1 (IC1) controls the parent of origin-specific expression of the IGF2 and H19 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 5 kb IC1 region contains multiple target sites (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e>) for the zinc-finger protein CTCF, whose binding on the maternal chromosome prevents the activation of IGF2 and allows that of H19 by common enhancers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CTCF binding helps maintaining the maternal IC1 methylation-free, whereas on the paternal chromosome gamete-inherited DNA methylation inhibits CTCF interaction and enhancer-blocking activity resulting in IGF2 activation and H19 silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maternally inherited 1.4-2.2 kb deletions are associated with methylation of the residual CTSs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome</z:e> (BWS), although with different penetrance and expressivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We explored the relationship between IC1 microdeletions and phenotype by analysing a number of previously described and novel mutant alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a highly quantitative assay based on next generation sequencing to measure DNA methylation in affected families and analysed enhancer-blocking activity and CTCF binding in cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the microdeletions mostly affect IC1 function and CTCF binding by changing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e> spacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the extent of IC1 inactivation and the clinical phenotype are influenced by the arrangement of the residual CTSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e> spacing similar to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> allele results in moderate IC1 inactivation and is associated with stochastic DNA methylation of the maternal IC1 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microdeletions with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e> spacing display severe IC1 inactivation and are associated with IC1 hypermethylation and complete penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Careful characterization of the IC1 microdeletions is therefore needed to predict recurrence risks and phenotypical outcomes </plain></SENT>
