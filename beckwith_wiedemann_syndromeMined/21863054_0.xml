<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation defects involving ICR1 result in two growth disorders with opposite phenotypes: an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disorder, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (maternal ICR1 hypermethylation in 10% of BWS cases) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> disorder, the Silver-Russell syndrome (paternal ICR1 loss of methylation in 60% of SRS cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In familial BWS, hypermethylation of ICR1 has been found in association with microdeletion of repetitive DNA motifs within ICR1 that bind the zinc finger protein CTCF; but more recently, ICR1 point mutations were described in BWS pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a case report of two brothers with BWS and prolonged post-pubertal growth resulting in very large stature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A maternally inherited point mutation was identified in ICR1 in both brothers, which altered binding of OCT transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same mutation was present on the paternally inherited allele of their unaffected mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is a second report of a point mutation causing ICR1 hypermethylation by altering an OCT-binding motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The atypical growth phenotype of the brothers may be connected to the unusual underlying cause of their BWS </plain></SENT>
