<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date over 20 imprinted genes have been identified in mouse and man and these appear to lie in clusters in restricted regions on a subset of chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This may be a critical feature of imprinting suggesting a domain-type mode of regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imprinted domains are replicated asynchronously, show sex-specific meiotic recombination frequencies and have CpG-rich regions that are differentially methylated, often associated with the imprinted genes themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mouse distal chromosome 7 is one such domain, containing at least nine imprinted genes spanning over 1 Mb of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the maternally expressed p57Kip2 gene, passage through the female germline is essential to generate the active state, whereas passage through the male germline is needed to force the maternally expressed H19 gene into an inactive state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that the mouse distal chromosome 7 imprinted domain is actually composed of two or more independently regulated subdomains </plain></SENT>
