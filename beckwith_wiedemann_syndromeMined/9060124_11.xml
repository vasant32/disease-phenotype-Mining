<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Placental features were recorded over a 10-month period in women undergoing ultrasound examination at 10-14 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020217" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="HYDM">molar pregnancy</z:e>, the fetal karyotype was obtained in utero and, if the pregnancy continued, the maternal concentration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and uterine artery resistance to flow were measured serially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A histopathological examination of the placenta was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the study period, 9425 women had an early scan and 11 molar pregnancies were identified including one classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027962,C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mole</z:e>, four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_456'>hydatidiform moles</z:mpath> coexisting with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy, three partial triploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027962,C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">moles</z:e> and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334529" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">partial moles</z:e> associated in one case with a fetus presenting congenitial anomalies diagnostic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hCG levels were high in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases except one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">triploidy</z:e> and remained high during the rest of the pregnancy in cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_456'>hydatidiform moles</z:mpath> coexisting with a fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these cases, the uterine artery resistance was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present data indicate that placental ultrasound examination can correctly identify molar changes in early pregnancy and together with hCG level and uterine Doppler measurements can establish the differential diagnosis in utero of the various forms of placental molar transformations </plain></SENT>
