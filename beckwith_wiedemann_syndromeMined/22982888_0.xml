<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> and other congenital abnormalities but no identified genetic mutation; the third had genetically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001578'>Cushing syndrome</z:hpo>, the third had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598639" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercortisolemia</z:e> but no clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001578'>Cushing syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral adrenalectomy cured <z:hpo ids='HP_0001578'>Cushing syndrome</z:hpo> in the 2 with severe symptoms; total adrenal weight in these patients was 44 and 53 g, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unilateral adrenalectomy was performed in the third patient: the gland weighed 52 g; postoperatively, the patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598639" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercortisolemia</z:e> normalized, and, concomitantly, the enlarged contralateral adrenal gland had a 5-fold decrease in size with slight enlargement 6 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, the 3 patients had similar pathology: massive adrenal enlargement due to a combination of cytomegaly, persistence of the transient cortex, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the permanent cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathologic findings were most likely the result of the genetic mutation identified in 1 patient and of an unknown mutation in the remaining 2 patients </plain></SENT>
