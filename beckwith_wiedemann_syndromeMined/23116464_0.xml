<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A child was normally conceived and born by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011410'>caesarian section</z:hpo> to a healthy 19 year old smoking mother (G2P1) at 38 weeks gestation, with SGA (birthweight <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> -2.44), placenta weight 250g (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> histology), with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001537'>umbilical hernia</z:hpo> and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo> but no other features of BWS.The methylation status at 11p15 region was initially investigated by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, methylation-specific (ms) PCR was performed to screen for this and other imprinted loci abnormalities at PLAG1 (6q24), IGF2R (6q27), GRB10 (7p12), PEG1/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MEST</z:e> (7q32), DLK1 (14q32), SNRPN (15q11); PEG3 (19q32), NESPAS/GNAS (20q13).Leucocyte DNA methylation was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at ICR1 but markedly reduced at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> using both MLPA and ms-PCR, and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other anomalies</z:e> of imprinting were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Buccal DNA methylation was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> imprinted sites tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first report of an isolated LOM at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> in leucocyte but not buccal DNA in a normally conceived singleton SGA child without overt SRS or BWS </plain></SENT>
