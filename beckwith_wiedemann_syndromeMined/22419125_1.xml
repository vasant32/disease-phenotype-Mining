<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of diseases have been found to be linked to aberrant methylation of specific genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most of the routine diagnostic techniques to detect epigenetic disturbances are restricted to single loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a precise quantification of the methylation status is often hampered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A considerable fraction of patients with Silver-Russell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008255'>transient neonatal diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> exhibit loss of methylation at further imprinted loci in addition to the disease specific ones (multilocus methylation defects, MLMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the currently available tests are mainly focused on single imprinted loci on different chromosomes and thereby make the detection of multilocus methylation defects time-consuming and expensive, we established methylation-specific single nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE) assays for a simultaneous quantification of methylation at multiple methylated loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We chose loci generally affected in patients with MLMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The method was validated by screening 66 individuals with known (epi)genetic disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison to other methylation-specific techniques, multilocus methylation-specific single nucleotide primer extension allows the quantitative analysis of numerous CpG islands of different loci in one assay and is, therefore, suitable for the simultaneous diagnostic testing for different congenital imprinting disorders in parallel, as well as for MLMD </plain></SENT>
