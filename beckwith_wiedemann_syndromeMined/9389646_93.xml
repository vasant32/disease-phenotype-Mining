<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also imprinted (expressed from the maternal allele) is the Igf2r gene on chromsome 17 encoding the type 2 IGF receptor that is involved in degradation of excess IGF-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Double mutant embryos carrying a deletion around the H19 region and also a targeted Igf2r allele, both inherited maternally, have extremely high levels of IGF-II (7- and 11-fold higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in tissues and serum, respectively) as a result of biallelic Igf2 expression (imprint relaxation by deletion of H19-associated sequence) in combination with lack of the IGF2R-mediated IGF-II turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This excess of IGF-II causes somatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003271'>visceromegaly</z:hpo>, placentomegaly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo>, and cardiac and adrenal defects, which are also features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), a genetically complex human disorder associated with chromosomal abnormalities in the 11p15.5 region where the IGF2 gene resides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the double mutant mouse embryos exhibit skeletal defects and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, which are manifestations observed frequently in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDYS">Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome</z:e>, another <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disorder overlapping phenotypically, but not genetically, with BWS </plain></SENT>
