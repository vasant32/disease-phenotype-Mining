<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This region is syntenic to human chromosome 11p15.5, which is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) and certain childhood and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These contigs provide the basis for genomic sequencing, identification of genes and their regulatory elements, and functional studies in transgenic and knockout mice, which should be of help to understand not only the mechanisms of imprinting but also the molecular events involved in the genesis of BWS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
