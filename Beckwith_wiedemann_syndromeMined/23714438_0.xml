<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If the answer is positive, to investigate whether there is a causal relationship between IVF or ICSI and the imprinted diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Review study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Eight epidemiologic studies were suitable to calculate the weighted relative risk for the birth of a child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> following IVF or ICSI compared with the risk in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This relative risk was 5.2 (95% CI 1.6-7.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one study the relative risk was corrected for parents' fertility problems and no significant association was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data on the Silver-Russell syndrome are too sparse to draw conclusions, but a positive association with IVF or ICSI treatment is probable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found between the incidences of the Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes and IVF or ICSI treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Children with Prader-Willi syndrome or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> are more likely to be born to parents with fertility problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastomas</z:hpo> in children born after IVF or ICSI could be explained by de novo mutations in the RB1 gene and were not associated with imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Imprinted diseases result from methylation errors already present in sperms or oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is no proof of a causal relationship between imprinted diseases and IVF or ICSI treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): Imprinting disorders are more prevalent after human IVF or ICSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future studies should correct for fertility problems in the affected and comparison groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is highly improbable that assisted reproduction technologies cause imprinted diseases in humans </plain></SENT>
