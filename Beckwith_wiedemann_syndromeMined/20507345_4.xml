<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To facilitate the diagnosis of epigenetic errors and chromosomal imbalance of 11p15.5, we validated a pyrosequencing assay to measure methylation at KvDMR1 using blood samples from 13 BWS cases, 8 of which showed reduced methylation as compared to control blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An imbalance between maternal and paternal genomes as is found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">triploidy</z:e>, CHM or PMD was also associated with altered KvDMR1 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A reciprocal pattern of methylation was obtained in the triploid cases by assaying the proximal 11p15.5 ICR associated with H19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To distinguish chromosome 11 specific alterations from whole genome imbalance, other imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) can be utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, pyrosequencing assays for DMRs associated with SGCE, SNRPN, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MEST</z:e> were also compared for their utility in diagnosing parental imbalance in placental samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While each of these assays could successfully distinguish parental origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">triploidy</z:e>, SGCE showed the clearest separation between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined use of a chromosome 11p15.5 assay (e.g. KvDMR1 or H19-ICR) and non-chromosome 11 assay (e.g. SGCE) provides a potentially valuable diagnostic tool in the rapid screening of methylation errors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">placental disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results also show the maintenance of imprinting status at these loci in the human placenta, even in the presence of abnormal pathology </plain></SENT>
