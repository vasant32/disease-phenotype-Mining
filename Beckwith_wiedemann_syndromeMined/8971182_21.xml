<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the p57KIP2 gene, which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, undergoes <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> and lies within a 700-kb domain of imprinted genes on 11p15, including IGF2 and H19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity and loss of imprinting (LOI) of this region are frequently observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> (WT) and other embryonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although LOI of p57KIP2 was observed in some WTs (approximately 10%), allele-specific expression was preserved in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because our initial studies were inconclusive concerning the absolute expression level of p57KIP2 in WT, we developed a sensitive and quantitative RNase protection assay to determine if changes in p57KIP2 expression play a role in WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of p57KIP2 was found to be virtually absent in 21 of 21 WTs compared to matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> kidney from the same patients, as well as compared to fetal kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also examined p57KIP2 expression in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> kidney and tongue of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), which predisposes to WT and also involves LOI of IGF2 and H19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although p57KIP2 was undetectable in BWS tongue, similar results were also observed in postnatal non-BWS tongue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most primary skin fibroblast cultures of BWS cell lines exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imprinting of p57KIP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, one BWS patient did show LOI of p57KIP2 in skin fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, p57KIP2 is part of a domain of genes on 11p15 that show altered expression and, in some cases, altered imprinting in WT and BWS </plain></SENT>
