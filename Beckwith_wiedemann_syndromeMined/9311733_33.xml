<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetics of BWS have implicated a gene that maps to chromosome 11p15 and is paternally imprinted, and the gene encoding the cyclin-cdk inhibitor p57KIP2 has been a strong candidate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By complete sequencing of the coding exons and intron/exon junctions, we found a maternally transmitted coding mutation in the cdk-inhibitor domain of the KIP2 gene in one of five cases of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BWS mutation was an in-frame three-amino-acid deletion that significantly reduced but did not fully abrogate growth-suppressive activity in a transfection assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no somatic coding mutations in KIP2 were found in a set of 12 primary WTs enriched for cases that expressed KIP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, including cases with and without 11p15.5 loss of heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two other 11p15.5 loci, the linked and oppositely imprinted H19 and IGF2 genes, have been previously implicated in WT pathogenesis, and several of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with persistent KIP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and absence of KIP2 coding mutations showed full inactivation of H19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that KIP2 is a BWS gene but that it is not uniquely equivalent to the 11p15.5 "WT2" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor locus </plain></SENT>
