<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fetal growth restriction is associated with morbidity among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> (SGA) neonates as well as in children and adults who were former SGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes (whose expression is restricted to a single parental allele) have a critical role in controlling mammalian fetal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The human chromosome 11p15 encompasses two imprinted domains regulated by their own differentially methylated imprinted control region (ICR1 at the H19/IGF2 domain, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> at the KCNQ1/CDKN1C domain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of imprinting at these two domains is implicated in two clinically opposite growth disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, our group has identified a loss of DNA methylation (LOM) at ICR1 in over 50% of patients with Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS) characterized by intrauterine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo> with spared cranial growth, dysmorphic features, frequent body asymmetry and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding difficulties</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, gain of methylation at ICR1 is found in 10% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome with an enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumor</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have now identified over 130 RSS patients with 11p15 LOM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This 11p15 epimutation is a frequent and specific cause of RSS as it has not been identified in non syndromic SGA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These new findings in the pathophysiology of RSS allow long-term follow-up studies to be performed based on molecular diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This will help to define appropriate clinical guidelines regarding growth, rapid bone age advance during puberty and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding difficulties</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, we have also recently found that ∼10% of RSS patients and ∼25% of BWS patients showed multilocus LOM at imprinted regions other than ICR1 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> 11p15, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Several clinical studies demonstrated that assisted reproductive technology significantly increased the risk of human imprinting diseases including BWS and RSS, suggesting that the environment may favor imprinting disorders </plain></SENT>
