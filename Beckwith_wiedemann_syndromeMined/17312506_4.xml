<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical tongue reduction is often performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> results in abnormal tongue function or cosmesis; however, no published studies have examined the long-term outcomes of this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients older than 18 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> who had previously undergone surgical tongue reduction at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne underwent assessment of speech and tongue function, mobility, sensation, and cosmesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These assessments were performed by questionnaire on 11 subjects and by formal medical and speech pathology review in four of these 11 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients aged 19 to 31 years completed responses by means of questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common self-reported abnormalities were continued disproportionate tongue bulk (91 percent), abnormal tongue appearance (82 percent), specific speech sound errors (73 percent), and a short tongue tip (55 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Formal assessments investigated speech, swallowing, taste, and tongue mobility in four quite different subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these four subjects had no detectable deficits in tongue function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 11 patients were of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence and did not report significant difficulties in their day-to-day life that were attributable to their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> or tongue reduction surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> requiring surgical tongue reduction may not achieve complete normality in tongue function and appearance in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is important that surgical tongue reduction addresses the global nature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> and aims to retain a tapered tongue tip with length sufficient to permit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tongue movements </plain></SENT>
