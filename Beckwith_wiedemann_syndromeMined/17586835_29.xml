<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nation-wide questionnaire survey was performed regarding ART in families with a child with AS, BWS or Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) including questions on fertility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular data on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> in affected children were gathered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 220 affected children in this study, 14 (6.4%) were born following any form of ART compared with 83 818 (2.1%) in the Dutch population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of AS, PWS or BWS children 15 (6.8%) were born after a fertility problem (Time To Pregnancy &gt; 12 months, no forms of ART) compared to 141,340 (3.5%) in the Dutch population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maternal age in the individual syndromes was higher than in the Dutch population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Families with affected children were three times more likely to experience fertility problems than the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three syndromes were also individually associated with increased fertility problems in the families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After correction for the increased fertility problems of the parents, there is no increased incidence of ART related birth of AS, PWS or BWS children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ART does not seem to have a direct effect on the increase of imprinted diseases </plain></SENT>
