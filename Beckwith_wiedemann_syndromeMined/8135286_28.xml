<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these syndromes, the chromosomes involved are thought to contain one or more imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When two copies of the imprinted (inactivated) gene are inherited from a single parent through <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> or the active gene is deleted, the phenotype of the syndrome results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our goal is to identify additional syndromes caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our approach is to select syndromes that appear to have more than one <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> and are occasionally associated with a cytogenetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given this criterion, we have chosen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270972" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CDL|CDLS|BDLS|CDLS1">Brachmann-de Lange Syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDLS</z:e>) to investigate since the phenotype is similar to that found in patients with dup(3q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have studied 16 probands with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDLS</z:e> and their parents using a multiplex of four PCR-based polymorphic loci on chromosome 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the probands studied had <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> for chromosome 3 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> for at least one locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given these results, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of chromosome 3 does not appear to be a major contributor to the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, both maternally and paternally derived chromosome abnormalities have resulted in the dup(3q) phenotype and dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BDLS</z:e> from both mildly affected mothers and fathers have been reported which suggests that imprinting is not involved in these syndromes </plain></SENT>
