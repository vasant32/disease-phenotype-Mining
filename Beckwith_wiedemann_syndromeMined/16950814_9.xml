<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, several reports have been published that showed a higher incidence of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> compared with the general population, and in most of these patients, aberrant methylation imprints of KvDMR1 have been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has led to the concern that ART might increase the incidence of imprinting syndromes such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Not much is known on environmental or genetic factors that may interfere with the processes of imprint maintenance or resetting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A methylation analysis of KvDMR1 was performed in human oocytes at different stages of nuclear maturity and in sperm cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the maternal methylation imprints were already established at the germinal vesicle stage, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sperm cells were unmethylated, thereby showing that the KvDMR1 carries a germline methylation imprint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For one of the oocytes analysed, an unmethylated pattern was found, which highlights the need for further molecular studies that consider the safety of ART </plain></SENT>
