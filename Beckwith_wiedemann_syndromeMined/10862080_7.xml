<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we have examined 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome</z:e> (BWS) for mutations affecting the CDKN1C gene, including seven cases of familial BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations were not detected in the coding region of the CDKN1C gene in any individual with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However in two patients, two G/A base substitutions at adjacent positions in the 5'UTR were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These substitutions were also found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of CDKN1C in somatic tissues was examined in 18 of the 32 cases using semi-quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CDKN1C expression was significantly reduced in the peripheral blood of three cases compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, although coding region mutations in the CDKN1C gene are rare in BWS, mutations disrupting CDKN1C expression may be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of five informative patients exhibited biallelic CDKN1C expression in lymphocytes, cord blood, and kidney tissue, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biallelic expression was not associated with overall CDKN1C levels significantly different to those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who expressed CDKN1C biallelically, or who were low CDKN1C expressors, maintained monoallelic methylation in the Differentially Methylated Region 2 (DMR2) of the IGF2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient expressing CDKN1C biallelically, maintained imprinted gene expression at the IGF2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that biallelic CDKN1C expression does not significantly perturb the overall levels of CDKN1C expression in somatic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They also confirm other studies showing that the mechanisms associated with regulating CDKN1C expression and imprinting are separate from those regulating IGF2 imprinting </plain></SENT>
