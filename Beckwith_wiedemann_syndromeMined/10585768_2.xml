<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously identified a chromosomal rearrangement between fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and a novel gene, FRAG1, in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the potential role of FRAG1 in disease further, we have isolated cDNA and genomic clones of human FRAG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed the presence of an insertion not contained in the original FRAG1 sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This insertion in human FRAG1 encoded a region highly homologous to and immediately following the first 55 amino acids of the protein, indicating the presence of a repetitive domain within FRAG1, designated the FRAG1 homology (FH) domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of FRAG1 gene structure revealed that the FH domains were encoded by tandem duplicated exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Database searches identified several transmembrane proteins displaying homology to the FH domain of FRAG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, hydropathy analysis predicted FRAG1 to encode an integral membrane protein with multiple membrane-spanning segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FRAG1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was ubiquitously expressed in human adult tissues and several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines at varying levels of abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Human FRAG1 was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid analysis to chromosome 11 at band p15.5, a region implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and a region of frequent loss of heterozygosity in multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that FRAG1 may be a useful candidate gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> associated with alterations at 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
