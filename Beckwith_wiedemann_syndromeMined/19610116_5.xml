<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple surveillance protocols have been proposed to detect the most commonly reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the history of our patients who were part of this monitoring protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information from 63 cases was collected retrospectively while another 63 control samples for AFP measurement were obtained prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five (40%) patients had an ultrasound abnormality, the most frequent being nephromegaly/size discrepancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had well documented cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> precursor (2/63:3.2%) detected by ultrasound images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three hundred thirty-six separate AFP values were available with values above 50,000 ng/ml seen in three patients older than 2 months, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> and two other with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_239'>hemangioendotheliomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no clear difference in the range of AFP values between previously reported controls, our own <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population and affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ultrasound surveillance detected renal and liver pathology including benign and malignant lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The known variability of AFP in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neonates and patients with BWS makes interpretation difficult in early infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Very high AFP values did seem to be correlated with risk for identifiable liver lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Determination of the natural changes in AFP levels over time will allow more appropriate comparison </plain></SENT>
