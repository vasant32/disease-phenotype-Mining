<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the pathology in the latter condition does not differ greatly from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) Bart <z:hpo ids='HP_0001789'>hydrops fetalis</z:hpo>, we performed a retrospective review of fetal and perinatal autopsy cases with Hb Bart to determine the prevalence of AC in that condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over a 10-year period (2001-2010) at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, there were 16 hydropic cases confirmed to have Hb Bart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0008186'>Adrenocortical cytomegaly</z:hpo> was found in 13 cases (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we determined the occurrence of AC in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001789'>hydrops fetalis</z:hpo> not due to Hb Bart (n  =  33) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of congenital anomalies (n  =  34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0008186'>Adrenocortical cytomegaly</z:hpo> was identified in only 1 case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002323'>anencephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, AC is a common finding in cases of Hb Bart, a finding not previously documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our study suggests that Hb Bart is one of the conditions most commonly associated with AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean Hb levels for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo> cases with Hb Bart and those with other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> showed no significant difference (P  =  0.63), nor was there any significant difference in Hb levels between cases of Hb Bart with and without AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the consistency of AC in cases of Hb Bart suggests that further study of this particular group of patients might shed light on the pathogenesis of this poorly understood pathologic finding </plain></SENT>
