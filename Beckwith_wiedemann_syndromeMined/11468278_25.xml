<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic and epigenetic mutations are found in five different genes which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lie within a 1 Mb imprinted domain on human chromosome 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only two of these genes, p57(KIP2) (CDKN1C) and IGF2, are likely to be functionally involved in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of the additional mutations therefore suggests a role for the regulation of these two genes by distant cis-elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mouse Igf2 gene is regulated by enhancers and imprinting elements which lie &gt;120 kb downstream of its promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we show that key elements for expression of the mouse p57(Kip2) (Cdkn1c) gene also lie at a distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhancers for expression within skeletal muscle and cartilage lie &gt;25 kb downstream of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we find no evidence for allele-specific expression of p57(Kip2) (Cdkn1c) from our <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome transgenes that span 315 kb around the locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a key imprinting element for p57(Kip2) (Cdkn1c) also lies at a distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, BWS in humans may result from disruption of appropriate expression of the p57(KIP2) (CDKN1C) gene through mutations that occur at a substantial distance from the gene </plain></SENT>
