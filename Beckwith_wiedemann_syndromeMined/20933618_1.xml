<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present an infant with a de novo cytogenetically visible interstitial deletion of approximately 21.9Mb involving chromosome bands 7p15.1-7p12.1, with the loss of 119 genes confirmed by array CGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TheÂ infant had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, hand and skull anomalies, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> compatible with haploinsufficiency of TBX20, GLI3, and GCK genes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the infant had some features reminiscent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001537'>umbilical hernia</z:hpo>, and a relatively large birth weight and we speculate that this is due to the deletion of GRB10, an imprinted gene on chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report illustrates how knowledge of genes within a deleted interval facilitates optimal medical management, can explain observed phenotypes, and stimulates research questions </plain></SENT>
