<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative Southern blot analysis of DNA from patient A defines a large inherited duplicated segment of chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For patient B, a de novo duplication of unknown origin has been shown to contain a segment of 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This chromosome segment includes the genes for insulin-like growth factor 2, beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, calcitonin A (CALCA), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the myogenic differentiation factor, MYOD1, is not included in the duplicated segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that MYOD1 is proximal to CALCA and PTH and excludes MYOD1 as the BWS gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data place the BWS gene distal to MYOD1 on 11p15 </plain></SENT>
