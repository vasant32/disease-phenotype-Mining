<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This linked organization suggests coordinated mechanisms controlling imprinted expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have sequenced 250 kb in the centre of the mouse imprinting cluster on distal chromosome 7 and compared it with the orthologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> gene cluster on human chromosome 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This first comparative imprinting cluster analysis revealed a high structural and functional conservation of the six orthologous genes identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, several striking differences were also discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First, compared with the mouse the human sequence is approximately 40% longer, mostly due to insertions of two large repetitive clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these clusters encompasses an additional gene coding for a homologue of the ribosomal protein L26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Second, pronounced blocks of unique direct repeats characteristic of imprinted genes were only found in the human sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Third, two of the orthologous gene pairs Tssc4/TSSC4 and Ltrpc5/LTRPC5 showed apparent differences in imprinting between human and mouse, whereas others like Tssc6/TSSC6 were not imprinted in either organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together these results suggest a significant functional and structural variability in the centre of the imprinting cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some genes escape imprinting in both organisms whereas others exhibit tissue- and species-specific imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence the control of imprinting in the cluster appears to be a highly dynamic process under fast evolutionary adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, whereas imprinted genes within the cluster contain CpG islands the non-imprinted Ltrpc5 and Tssc6/TSSC6 do not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This and additional comparisons with other imprinted and non-imprinted regions suggest that CpG islands are key features of imprinted domains </plain></SENT>
