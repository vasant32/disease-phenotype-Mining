<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in KvLQT1 underlie the dominantly transmitted Ward-Romano <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, which causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and the recessively transmitted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022387" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome</z:e>, which causes both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>congenital deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>KvLQT1 is also disrupted by balanced germline chromosomal rearrangements in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), which causes prenatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the diverse human disorders and organ systems affected by this gene, we developed an animal model by inactivating the murine Kvlqt1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No electrocardiographic abnormalities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, homozygous mice exhibited complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo>, as well as circular movement and repetitive falling, suggesting imbalance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histochemical study revealed severe anatomic disruption of the cochlear and vestibular end organs, suggesting that Kvlqt1 is essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development of the inner ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, homozygous mice also displayed threefold enlargement by weight of the stomach resulting from mucous neck cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, there were no features of BWS, suggesting that Kvlqt1 is not responsible for BWS </plain></SENT>
