<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The locus has been assigned to 11p15.5, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> may play a part in the expression of one or more genes involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most cases are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An excess of female monozygotic twins discordant for WBS have been reported, and it has been proposed that this excess could be related to the process of X chromosome inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have therefore studied X chromosome inactivation in 13-year-old monozygotic twin girls who were discordant for WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, both twins had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040517" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="GTS">Tourette syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The twins were monochorionic and therefore the result of a late twinning process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This has also been the case in previously reported discordant twin pairs with information on placentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>X chromosome inactivation was determined in DNA from peripheral blood cells by PCR analysis at the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The affected twin had a completely skewed X inactivation, where the paternal allele was on the active X chromosome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The unaffected twin had a moderately skewed X inactivation in the same direction, whereas the mother had a random pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to establish a possible association between the expression of WBS and X chromosome inactivation </plain></SENT>
