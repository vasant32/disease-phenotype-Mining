<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To date, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) with phenotypic relevance is described for different chromosomes and it is likely that additional as yet unidentified UPD phenotypes exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to technical difficulties and limitations of time and resources, molecular analyses for UPD using microsatellite markers are only performed in cases with specific phenotypic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we carried out a whole genome UPD screening based on a microarray genotyping technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients with the diagnosis of both complete or segmental UPD including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS; matUPD15), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (AS; patUPD15), Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS; matUPD7), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS; patUPD11p), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000852'>pseudohypoparathyroidism</z:hpo> (PHP; patUPD20q) and a rare chromosomal rearrangement (patUPD2p, matUPD2q), were genotyped using the GeneChip Human Mapping 10K Array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the presence of UPD in the patients with high efficiency and reveal clues about the mechanisms of UPD formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We thus conclude that array based SNP genotyping is a fast, cost-effective, and reliable approach for whole genome UPD screening </plain></SENT>
