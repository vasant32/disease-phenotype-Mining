<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both maternal gestational proteinuric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_100'>placental abnormalities</z:mpath> have been reported infrequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, but the occurrence of three cases with both features at one institution within a year suggests that this may be an underreported association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASES: Severe gestational proteinuric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in three women led to termination of one pregnancy at 22 weeks' gestation, delivery by cesarean in another at 27 weeks of an infant who had <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> and died at age 3 days, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> at 31 weeks in the third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three infants had features diagnostic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Placentomegaly had been identified by ultrasound in each case and was determined pathologically as mainly attributable to stromal expansion of the villous tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>Cysts</z:mpath> resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo> in stem villi were identified ultrasonographically in one placenta; this lesion may be specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third placenta was associated with a discrete complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_456'>hydatidiform mole</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> should be considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in which gestational proteinuric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is associated with ultrasound findings of placentomegaly, with or without associated cystic changes in the placenta, and an examination should be made for other confirmatory features </plain></SENT>
