<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are mainly caused by epigenetic alterations in one of the two imprinting 11p15 control regions (ICR1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These CpG-rich regions are differentially methylated on the maternally and paternally derived chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report four different methylation patterns along the BWS/SRS critical region, clarified by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mathematical processing of the data provides information about alterations in the methylation status: from hypo- to almost complete demethylation of KvDMR, hypo- and hypermethylation of H19DMR and combined results from both regions provide information on paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (patUPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study concerns two BWS cases with KvDMR hypomethylation and almost complete loss of methylation, respectively; two patUPD11p15 cases with H19DMR hypermethylation/KvDMR hypomethylation, and one SRS case with H19DMR demethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some cases KvDMR hypomethylation in patUPD11p15 can be difficult to assess, which requires combination with STR analysis or alternative method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The STR analysis provides also information on complete or segmental coverage and iso- or heterodisomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following this systematic approach, the precise diagnosis can be clarified in a few days and different methylation patterns could be detected </plain></SENT>
