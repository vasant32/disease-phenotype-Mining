<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A frequent alteration in BWS involves changes in the imprinting status of the coordinately regulated IGF2 and H19 genes on 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients have been categorized according to alterations in the imprinted expression, allele-specific methylation, and regional replication timing of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work, IGF2/H19 expression, H19 DNA methylation, and IGF2 regional replication timing were studied in nine karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BWS fibroblasts and two BWS patients with maternally inherited 11p15 chromosomal rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Informative patients (9/9) maintained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monoallelic H19 expression/methylation, despite biallelic IGF2 expression in 6/9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Replication timing studies revealed no changes in the pattern of asynchronous replication timing for both a patient with biallelic IGF2 expression and a patient carrying an 11p15 inversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a patient with a chromosome 11;22 translocation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> H19 expression/methylation exhibited partial loss of asynchrony and a shift toward earlier replication times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in BWS, (1) H19 imprinting alterations are less frequent than previously estimated, (2) IGF2 imprinting and H19 imprinting are not necessarily coordinated, and (3) alterations in regional replication timing are generally not correlated with either chromosomal rearrangements or the imprinting status of IGF2 and H19 </plain></SENT>
