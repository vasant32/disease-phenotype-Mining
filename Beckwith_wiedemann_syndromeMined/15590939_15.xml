<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the animal kingdom, <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> appears to be restricted to mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains an open question how structural features for imprinting evolved in mammalian genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clustering of genes around imprinting control centers (ICs) is regarded as a hallmark for the coordinated imprinted regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence imprinted clusters might be structurally distinct between mammals and nonimprinted vertebrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address this question we compared the organization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) gene cluster in mammals, chicken, Fugu (pufferfish), and zebrafish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our analysis shows that gene synteny is apparently well conserved between mammals and birds, and is detectable but less pronounced in fish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, clustering apparently evolved during vertebrate radiation and involved two major duplication events that took place before the separation of the fish and mammalian lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cross-species analysis of imprinting center regions showed that some structural features can already be recognized in nonimprinted amniotes in one of the imprinting centers (IC2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the imprinting center IC1 is absent in chicken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests a progressive and stepwise evolution of imprinting control elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In line with that, imprinting centers in mammals apparently exhibit a high degree of structural and sequence variation despite conserved epigenetic marking </plain></SENT>
