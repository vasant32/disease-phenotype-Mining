<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) have been observed in approximately one-third of fetuses or liveborn infants from pregnancies complicated by PMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are very few reports describing liveborn individuals with proven mosaicism for genome-wide patUPD in somatic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report two further children with complex phenotypes including some findings of BWS, congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000825'>hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, prolonged feeding difficulty and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001531'>failure to thrive in infancy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytomas</z:hpo> and progressive arterial stenoses, and the second had congenital adrenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath>, and later developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005585'>patchy hyperpigmentation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte DNA methylation studies of KCNQ1OT1/LIT1 and H19 loci (11p15.5) showed almost complete loss of maternal methylation (LOM) in patient 1 and partial LOM in patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite marker panels showed whole chromosome 11 patUPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SNP array studies in both were consistent with mosaic genome-wide patUPD in leukocytes, while fibroblast DNA in Patient 1 showed biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This report further illustrates the clinical consequences of mosaicism for genome-wide patUPD, which results in complex and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotypes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies for genome-wide UPD should be considered in individuals with atypical UPD phenotypes </plain></SENT>
