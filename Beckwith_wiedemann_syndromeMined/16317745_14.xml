<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>Hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> (HB) is the most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumor</z:e> in childhood, occurring in the first few years of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgery combined with chemotherapy has resulted in dramatic improvements in prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, even today, about one quarter of affected children do not survive the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to the general population, the risk of HB is 750-7,500 times higher in children predisposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> predispostion syndrome caused by germline mutations in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only limited data exist about the frequency of APC germline mutations in cases of apparently <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> HB without a family history of FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: In our sample of 1,166 German FAP families, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known cases of HB were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 50 patients with apparently <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> HB were examined for APC germline mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the FAP families, seven unrelated cases of HB are documented; three had been detected at an advanced stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with apparently <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> HB, germline mutations in the APC gene were identified in 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data raise the issue of the appropriate screening for HB in children of FAP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To date, the efficiency of surveillance for HB is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), recent studies suggest an earlier detection of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> and HB by frequent screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We discuss the rationale and implications of a screening program; besides the examination procedure itself, screening for HB in children of FAP patients would have important consequences for the policy of predictive testing in FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In a substantial fraction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> HB, the disease is obviously the first manifestation of a de novo FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These patients should be identified by routine APC mutation screening and undergo colorectal surveillance thereafter </plain></SENT>
