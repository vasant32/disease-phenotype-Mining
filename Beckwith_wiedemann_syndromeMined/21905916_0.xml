<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tongue reduction surgery (TRS) is advocated to overcome, or reduce, the secondary effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>Macroglossia</z:hpo> may affect a child's cosmetic appearance, feeding, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>drooling</z:hpo> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no study has systematically reported on feeding, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>drooling</z:hpo>, or psychosocial outcomes preoperatively and postoperatively in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to describe the presurgical and postsurgical psychosocial, feeding, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>drooling</z:hpo> outcomes of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> associated with BWS and to determine the effect of TRS on these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN : Clinical cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS : Ten consecutively admitted children with BWS (age at surgery from 9 months to 4 years, 9 months [4;9]; mean, 2;7) were assessed preoperatively, 3 months postoperatively, and at long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : A parental report questionnaire, the Brodsky <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>drooling</z:hpo> scale, and a feeding rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS : Parents reported that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> had a negative impact cosmetically that was ameliorated following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>Macroglossia</z:hpo> caused a range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding difficulties</z:hpo> presurgically by preventing lip seal and bolus manipulation during the oral preparatory phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>drooling</z:hpo> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases presurgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This resolved partially across the group postsurgically, with almost complete recovery at longer-term follow-up assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS : Presurgically, children show a common profile of feeding and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>drooling</z:hpo> impairment with negative effects on cosmetic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary results demonstrate that TRS has a positive impact on these features with good outcomes for children with BWS </plain></SENT>
