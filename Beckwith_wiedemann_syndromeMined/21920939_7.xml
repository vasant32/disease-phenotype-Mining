<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cluster of imprinted genes at chromosome 11p15.5 is associated with the growth disorders, Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cluster is divided into two domains with independent imprinting control regions (ICRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe two maternal 11p15.5 microduplications with contrasting phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first is an inverted and in cis duplication of the entire 11p15.5 cluster associated with the maintenance of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> and with the SRS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second is a 160 kb duplication also inverted and in cis, but resulting in the imprinting alteration of the centromeric domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It includes the centromeric ICR (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e>) and the most 5' 20 kb of the non-coding KCNQ1OT1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its maternal transmission is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> hypomethylation and the BWS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By excluding epigenetic mosaicism, cell clones analysis indicated that the two closely located <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> sequences resulting from the 160 kb duplication carried discordant DNA methylation on the maternal chromosome and supported the hypothesis that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> sequence is not sufficient for establishing imprinted methylation and some other property, possibly orientation-dependent, is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the 1.2 Mb duplication demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> features are present for correct imprinting at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> when this is duplicated and inverted within the entire cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the individuals maternally inheriting the 160 kb duplication, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> hypomethylation led to the expression of a truncated KCNQ1OT1 transcript and to down-regulation of CDKN1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated by chromatin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> immunopurification that the KCNQ1OT1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interacts with chromatin through its most 5' 20 kb sequence, providing a mechanism likely mediating the silencing activity of this long non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
