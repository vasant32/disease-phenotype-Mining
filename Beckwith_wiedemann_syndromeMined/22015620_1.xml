<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was a retrospective review of nephrourological investigations and genotype in 67 BWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imaging and laboratory studies have been correlated with the molecular anomalies typical of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight (56.7%) patients had a total of 61 nonmalignant nephrourological findings, including nephromegaly (n = 24), collecting system abnormalities (n = 14), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>cryptorchidism</z:hpo> (n = 11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000787'>nephrolithiasis</z:hpo> (n = 5), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> (n = 5), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with renal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Renal findings were almost consistent in the BWS(IC1) group, with nephromegaly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and collecting system abnormalities in half of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BWS(UPD) and negative patients also had frequent anomalies (63.6% and 61.9% respectively), whereas only 36.0% of BWS(IC2) had renal findings (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>Cryptorchidism</z:hpo> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defects</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001) appearing more frequently in BWS(IC2) (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>Urinary tract infections</z:hpo> were observed in 17.9% of patients, with two resulting in life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002150'>Hypercalciuria</z:hpo> was present in 10% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>55.5% of BWS patients have renal findings </plain></SENT>
