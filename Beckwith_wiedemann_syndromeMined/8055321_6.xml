<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>Genomic imprinting</z:mp> has recently been invoked to explain the unusual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> patterns in several disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reviewed 28 published kindreds of BWS and shown that <z:mp ids='MP_0003123'>paternal imprinting</z:mp> is probably responsible for familial BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, highly informative RFLP markers in the 11p15.5 region have been shown to segregate with the disease gene as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo>, but phenotypic manifestations in an offspring are dependent on the sex of the parent contributing the defective gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous reports in which imprinting of the growth stimulator gene, IGF2, has been invoked as the mechanism explaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases of BWS (especially in situations where <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of the 11p15.5 region has occurred), it is suggested that <z:mp ids='MP_0003123'>paternal imprinting</z:mp> of a growth suppressor gene, e.g., H19, may be one of the causes of familial BWS </plain></SENT>
