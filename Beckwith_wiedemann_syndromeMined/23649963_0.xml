<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000852'>pseudohypoparathyroidism</z:hpo> type 1b (PHP-1b) display a loss of imprinting (LOI) encompassing the GNAS locus resulting in PTH resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In other imprinting disorders, such as Russell Silver or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, we and others have shown that the LOI is not restricted to one imprinted locus yet may affect other imprinted loci for some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we hypothesized that patients with PHP-1b might present multilocus imprinting defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated, in 63 patients with PHP-1b, the methylation pattern of eight imprinted loci: GNAS, ZAC1, PEG1/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MEST</z:e>, ICR1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> on chromosome 11p15, SNRPN, DLK1/GTL2 IG-DMR and L3MBTL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found multilocus imprinting defects in four PHP-1b patients carrying broad LOI at the GNAS locus i- simultaneous hypermethylation at L3MBTL1 differentially methylated region 3 (DMR3), and hypomethylation at PEG1/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MEST</z:e> DMR (n = 1), ii- hypermethylation at the L3MBTL1 (DMR3) (n = 1) and at the DLK1/GTL2 IG-DMR (n = 1) and iii- hypomethylation at the L3MBTL1 DMR3 (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that mechanisms underlying multilocus imprinting defects in PHP-1b differ from those of other imprinting disorders having only multilocus loss of methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results favor the hypothesis of "epidominance", i.e. the phenotype is controlled by the most severely affected imprinted locus </plain></SENT>
