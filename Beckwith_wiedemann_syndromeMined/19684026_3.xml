<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes are commonly clustered in domains across the mammalian genome, suggesting a degree of coregulation via long-range coordination of their monoallelic transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distal end of mouse chromosome 7 (Chr 7) contains two clusters of imprinted genes within a approximately 1 Mb domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This region is conserved on human 11p15.5 where it is implicated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both species, imprinted regulation requires two critical cis-acting imprinting centres, carrying different germline epigenetic marks and mediating imprinted expression in the proximal and distal sub-domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clusters are separated by a region containing the gene for tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) as well as a high density of short repeats and retrotransposons in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have used the Cre-loxP recombination system in vivo to engineer an interstitial deletion of this approximately 280-kb intervening region previously proposed to participate in the imprinting mechanism or to act as a boundary between the two sub-domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The deletion allele, Del(7AI), is silent with respect to epigenetic marking at the two flanking imprinting centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reciprocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of Del(7AI) demonstrates that the deleted region, which represents more than a quarter of the previously defined imprinted domain, is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> in maternal heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In homozygotes, the deficiency behaves as a Th null allele and can be rescued pharmacologically by bypassing the metabolic requirement for TH in utero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the deleted interval is not required for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imprinting on distal Chr 7 and uncover a new imprinted growth phenotype </plain></SENT>
