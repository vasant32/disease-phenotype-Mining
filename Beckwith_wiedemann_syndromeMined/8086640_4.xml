<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We described a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> (RMS), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Karyotypes of peripheral lymphocytes and RMS cells were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA analyses showed maternal loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 11p15 region in RMS but not in <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The insulin-like growth factor II gene (IGF2) was found to be expressed at a moderate level in RMS but not in <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each of parental allele-derived IGF2 transcript was detected in <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>, while maternal allele-derived transcript was weak in RMS because of maternal LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that (1) loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF2 might be responsible for BWS, (2) on the other hand, LOI itself might not induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> occurrence in tissues where the control of tissue-specific expression of IGF2 is maintained, (3) increased expression of IGF2 due to maternal loss of a putative controller gene for IGF2 at 11p15 might predispose to sustaining tumorigenic mutations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, (4) loss of a putative onco-suppressor gene at 11p15 might induce RMS occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> was thought to be different from that of RMS </plain></SENT>
