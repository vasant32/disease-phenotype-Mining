<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Faithful establishment and maintenance of imprinting during mammalian fetal development is crucial for correct fetal and postnatal development of the individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, numerous complex syndromes (including Russell Silver Syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> are associated with loss of imprinting (LOI) at particular loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over recent years, there has been increasing evidence that LOI is not only an isolated event occurring at a given locus involved in a particular syndrome, but that many patients with a given syndrome have multilocus imprinting defects affecting both parental alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This new evidence demonstrates that these anomalies occur during the post-fertilization period of fetal development and raises the question of what mechanisms lead to these multilocus imprinting defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Identification of the factors involved in the maintenance and/or the establishment of imprinting is undoubtedly crucial for understanding both the mechanisms underlying imprinting regulation and which disruptions lead to these complex diseases </plain></SENT>
