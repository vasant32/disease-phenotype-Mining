<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We focused on 11p15, a chromosome band harboring at least 25 known genes and associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumors</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This underlines the need for a physical map for this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We divided the short arm of chromosome 11 into 18 breakpoint regions, and a large series of new and previously described genes and markers was mapped within these intervals using fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cosmid fingerprint analysis showed that 19 of these markers were included in cosmid contigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A detailed 10-Mb pulsed-field physical map of the region 11p15.3-pter was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These three different approaches enabled the high-resolution mapping of 210 markers, including 22 known genes </plain></SENT>
