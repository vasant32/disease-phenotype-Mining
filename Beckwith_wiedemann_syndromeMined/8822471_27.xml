<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their development was assessed using the Griffiths Scales of Mental Development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of minor congenital anomalies (31.9% in the cryopreserved embryo group and 21.7% in the controls) and major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> (3.3 and 2.4% respectively) in our two groups of children was statistically similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative risk (odds ratio and 95% confidence interval) in the cryopreserved embryo group compared with the controls was 1.7 (0.8, 3.3) for minor congenital anomalies and 1.4 (0.2, 8.5) for major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The minor congenital anomalies were mostly naevi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018916" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haemangiomas</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and hypophosphataemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002748'>rickets</z:hpo> in the cryopreserved embryo group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000126'>hydronephrosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001543'>gastroschisis</z:hpo> in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Griffiths assessment showed that children from the cryopreserved embryo group and the controls were functioning at a similar level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean Griffiths quotient and subquotient values were greater than the standard 100 in children with or without congenital abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results in the cryopreserved embryo group are reassuring in that the minor congenital anomaly and major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e> rates were similar to those in normally conceived children of a similar age, sex and social class and their development was not adversely affected by cryopreservation </plain></SENT>
