<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their clinical findings consist of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo>, anterior ear creases, indented lesions on the posterior rim of the helix, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, posterior crossbite, and anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0010807'>open bite</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The younger daughter and son had newly recognized findings of the BWS including <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> and supernumerary flexion creases of the fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel mutation in CDKN1C (c.579delT; p.A193AfsX46) was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected individuals and their mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This mutation is located in the central highly polymorphic hexanucleotide repeat encoding a proline-alanine series of repeats (PAPA-domain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This domain is involved in MAP kinase phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is for the first time that <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> and supernumerary flexion creases of the fingers are associated with mutation in CDKN1C </plain></SENT>
