<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Individuals with mosaic UPD of apparently <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chromosomes have recently been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They show a 46,XX karyotype, but with a mixture of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biparental cells and cells entirely of paternal isodisomic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe an infant who primarily showed signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), but also had other severe and eventually lethal medical problems, notably refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed methylation studies for BWS, but incidentally for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> on leukocytes and in a skin FFPE sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also performed chromosome microarray (CNV and SNP array) on leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the patient had hypomethylation consistent with both BWS and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, this was due to mosaic paternal UPD for chromosomes 11 and 15, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SNP microarray showed mosaic paternal UPD for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with unusual phenotypes for a typical imprinting disorder should be studied further with assays for imprinted loci on other chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal SNP microarrays are useful in identifying patients with multiple UPDs, sometimes of the whole genome </plain></SENT>
