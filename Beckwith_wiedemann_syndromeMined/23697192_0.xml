<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the perioperative course of 14 BWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were children who underwent tongue reduction surgery or glossopexy between 1994 and 2008 at Osaka Medical Center for Maternal &amp; Child Health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 18 months, and the median weight was 12.2 kg at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had the trachea intubated and another had tracheostomy to keep airway patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other 12 patients had no artificial airway and were premedicated with midazolam or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> and had the trachea intubated after induction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> and nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> in oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient developed difficult mask ventilation for which a nasal airway was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patients demonstrated difficult intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> without preoperative artificial airway were extubated in the OR after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Airway compromise in the two patients who was intubated or had tracheostomy prior to surgery was not alleviated by the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Airway disorder was not alleviated by tongue reduction surgery or glossopexy </plain></SENT>
