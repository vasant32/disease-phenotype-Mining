<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the imprinting mutations causing PWS and AS are essentially opposite in nature, remarkably, a small number of patients have been reported with clinical features of PWS but epigenetic mutations consistent with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here a patient who presented with clinical features partially consistent with both PWS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epimutations were found at both the AS/PWS and BWS loci, and additionally at the H19, PEG3, NESPAS and GNAS loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This patient is therefore the first described case with a primary epimutation consistent with AS accompanied by hypomethylation of other imprinted loci </plain></SENT>
