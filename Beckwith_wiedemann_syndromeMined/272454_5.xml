<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After considering several alternatives, the elliptical (modified Butlin-Handley), U-shaped excision was used in case 1 for the following reasons: symmetry and minimal disturbance of muscle attachment, reduction of thickness without reduction of width, and reduction in length of the tongue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Use of the V-shaped excision proved most advantageous in the second case where length, rather than thickness, was the only problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was hoped that partial glossectomy at an early age might help circumvent the attendant sequelae of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
