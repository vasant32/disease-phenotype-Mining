<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maternal deletions of the centromeric domain usually result in BWS, but paternal deletions have been so far associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a case of recurrent severe Intra-Uterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) with paternal transmission of an 11p15.5 60 kb deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Chromosome microarray (CMA), PCR and DNA sequencing analyses showed that two fetuses conceived by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> couple inherited from their father a 60 kb deletion encompassing the Imprinting Control Region of the 11p15.5 centromeric domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two fetuses died in utero with severe growth restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification of parental DNAs indicated that the father carried the mutation in the mosaic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation and gene expression analyses showed that the deletion led to an imprinting alteration restricted to the centromeric domain and resulting in silencing of KCNQ1OT1 and activation of CDKN1C and PHLDA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the phenotype associated with 11p15.5 deletions is strongly influenced by the size of the region involved and indicate imprinting defects leading to CDKN1C and PHLDA2 activation as cause of severe IUGR </plain></SENT>
