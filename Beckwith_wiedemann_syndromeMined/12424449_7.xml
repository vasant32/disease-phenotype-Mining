<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We present an overview of international literature concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>-related etiology, clinical and instrumental diagnoses, surgical treatments, complications, and recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we present a series of cases of patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> who have been treated surgically at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Rome "La Sapienza" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1990 and 1999, only after attempts to solve this pathologic condition with medical and orthodontic treatment, we treated surgically a total of 7 patients (4 male and 3 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surgical techniques used were Köle glossectomy and Dingman and Grabb glossectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the clinical and instrumental study and the surgical treatment, including possible complications and recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After follow-up of a period from 2 to 9 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> recurrences were absent, showing that the Köle and the Dingman and Grabb glossectomies are viable surgical options for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The best therapy for each case <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> must be carefully evaluated, with the right medical therapy and orthodontic therapy attempted first and surgical treatment performed only when the first and second therapy fail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, surgical techniques must be chosen in accordance with the functional results that one wants to achieve and must be the most conservative technique to preserve the vascular-nerve bundle </plain></SENT>
