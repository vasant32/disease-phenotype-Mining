<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most imprinted genes form clusters, or imprinting domains, and are regulated by imprinting control regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As imprinted genes have an important role in growth and development, aberrant expression of imprinted genes due to genetic or epigenetic abnormalities is involved in the pathogenesis of human disorders, or imprinting disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) is a representative imprinting disorder characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defects</z:hpo>, and exhibits a predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relevant imprinted chromosomal region in BWS is 11p15.5, which consists of two imprinting domains, IGF2/H19 and CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BWS has five known causative epigenetic and genetic alterations: loss of methylation (LOM) at KvDMR1, gain of methylation (GOM) at H19DMR, paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, CDKN1C mutations and chromosomal rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Opposite methylation defects, GOM and LOM, at H19DMR are known to cause clinically opposite disorders: BWS and Silver-Russell syndrome, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a recent study discovered that loss of function or gain of function of CDKN1C also causes clinically opposite disorders, BWS and IMAGe (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100255'>metaphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000835'>adrenal hypoplasia</z:hpo> congenita, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000078'>genital anomalies</z:hpo>) syndrome, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, several clinical studies have suggested a relationship between assisted reproductive technology (ART) and the risk of imprinting disorders, along with the existence of trans-acting factors that regulate multiple imprinted differentially methylated regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this review, we describe the latest knowledge surrounding the imprinting mechanism of 11p15.5, in addition to epigenetic and genetic etiologies of BWS, associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumors</z:e>, the effects of ART and multilocus hypomethylation disorders.Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 30 May 2013; doi:10.1038/jhg.2013.51 </plain></SENT>
