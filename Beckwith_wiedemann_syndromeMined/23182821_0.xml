<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its restriction is associated with morbidity and long term metabolic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes have a critical role in mammalian fetal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The human chromosome 11p15 encompasses two imprinted domains regulated by their own differentially methylated region (DMR), also called Imprinted Control Region (ICR1 at the H19/IGF-2 domain, paternally methylated), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> at the KCNQ1/CDKN1C domain (maternally methylated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of imprinting at these two domains is implicated in two growth disorders clinically opposite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A loss of DNA methylation (LOM) at ICR1 is identified in over 50% of patients with Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS), characterized by intrauterine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo>, spared cranial growth, frequent body asymmetry and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding difficulties</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inversely, a gain of methylation at ICR1 is found in 10% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome with an enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumor</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have identified over 150 RSS patients with 11p15 LOM allowing long-term follow-up studies and proposal of clinical guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found that ∼10% of RSS patients and ∼25% of BWS patients have multilocus LOM at imprinted regions other than ICR1 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> 11p15, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have identified cis-acting regulatory elements and trans-acting factors involved in the regulation of 11p15 imprinting, establishing new potential mechanisms of RSS and BWS </plain></SENT>
