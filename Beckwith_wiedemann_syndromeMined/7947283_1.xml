<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A constitutional, balanced chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(p15.5;q11.21) was discovered in a tall young man during investigation of a red cell dimorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The red cells are predominantly normochromic and normocytic with a small population of hypochromic, microcytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contained within the regions involved in the translocation are determinants of height (IGF2:11p15.5), red cell haemoglobinization (non-alpha <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene complex: 11p15.5) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> (cHa-Ras-1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>: 11p15.5; BCR, Burkitts <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Ewings <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>: 22q11.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To map these regions in the patient, somatic cell hybrids were generated and cell lines that segregated the chromosomes 11, 22 and 22q- were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 11p15.5 sequences investigated, in particular the whole of the non-alpha <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene complex including its 5' and 3' regulatory sequences, were found to be translocated to 22q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> chromosome 22 sequences studied were missing from the 22q- cell lines, including the proximal anonymous marker D22S24, and therefore assumed to be translocated to 11p+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the non-alpha <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene complex has been moved close to the centromeric region of chromosome 22q- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that such a positioning subjects the complex to a variegated position-effect bringing about a clonal exclusion of the complex and thus producing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878521" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassaemia trait</z:e> mosaic </plain></SENT>
