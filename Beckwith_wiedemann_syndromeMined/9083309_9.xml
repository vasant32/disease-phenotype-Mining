<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess intrauterine growth in a series of nine fetuses diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Infants confirmed postnatally to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> were identified from records maintained in the Division of Clinical Genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antenatal ultrasound and birth records were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), and estimated fetal weight (EFW) were assigned percentiles based on gestational age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Newborn HC and birth weight were also assigned percentiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>Polyhydramnios</z:hpo> was diagnosed using either amniotic fluid index or documented subjective assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> had antenatal ultrasound examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of these had more than one examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two infants were suspected to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> in utero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Important ultrasound findings included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo> (four), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>enlarged liver</z:hpo> and kidneys (one), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>enlarged liver</z:hpo> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0010808'>tongue protrusion</z:hpo> on ultrasound was not identified in any fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six of nine fetuses (66%) with ultrasound examinations after 25 weeks' gestation had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the fetal HC, AC, and EFW percentiles demonstrated that fetuses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> may exhibit accelerated growth as early as 25-30 weeks' gestation, but may exceed the 90th percentile only after 36 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fetuses with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo>, and an AC less than the 90th percentile may have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>Polyhydramnios</z:hpo> and accelerated growth beginning between 25 and 36 weeks' gestation, even without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo>, should alert the physician to the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
