<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cloning of the entire chromosomal region will be important for the identification and characterization of critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a yeast artificial chromosome contig that covers up to 7 Mb of this chromosome band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most centromeric marker included in the contig is D11S932 and the most telomeric is D11S470 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have developed 18 new STS markers, which have been located in the contig in relation to 16 known markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the yeast artificial chromosome clones was found to span the chromosome 11 breakpoint of the translocation t(11;18), associated with a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cloning the regions in proximity to this translocation might reveal the presence of a gene altered in association with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
