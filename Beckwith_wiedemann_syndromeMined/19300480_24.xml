<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most cases are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and result from epimutations at either of the two 11p15.5 imprinting centres (IC1 and IC2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, rare familial cases may be associated with germline 11p15.5 deletions causing <z:mp ids='MP_0003787'>abnormal imprinting</z:mp> in cis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a family with BWS and an IC2 epimutation in which affected siblings had inherited different parental 11p15.5 alleles excluding an in cis mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a positional-candidate gene approach, we found that the mother was homozygous for a frameshift mutation in exon 6 of NLRP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While germline mutations in NLRP7 have previously been associated with familial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_456'>hydatidiform mole</z:mpath>, this is the first description of NLRP2 mutation in human disease and the first report of a trans mechanism for disordered imprinting in BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that NLRP2 has a previously unrecognised role in establishing or maintaining <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
