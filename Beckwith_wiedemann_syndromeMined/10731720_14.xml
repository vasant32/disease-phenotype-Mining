<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified a paternally expressed imprinted gene, PEG8/IGF2AS, in this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is transcribed in the opposite direction to the IGF2 transcripts and some genomic regions are shared with the IGF2 gene, as in the case of the mouse imprinted Igf2as gene reported previously by T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moore et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As to the relationship between these genomic regions, the human and mouse genes are very similar but there is no homology in their middle parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, PEG8/IGF2AS and IGF2 were found to be overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> samples, at levels over ten and a hundred times higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> kidney tissues neighboring the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that PEG8/IGF2AS is a good marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> and also suggest the possibility of PEG8/IGF2AS being one of the candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> genes </plain></SENT>
