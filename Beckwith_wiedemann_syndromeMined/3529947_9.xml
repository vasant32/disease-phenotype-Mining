<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several patients in whom the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) is associated with duplication of chromosomal region 11p15 have recently been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genes encoding insulin and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), proteins that affect cellular growth and pancreatic function, have been mapped to 11p15, and their increased expression might, thus, account for the physical features of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether BWS is frequently associated with small duplications of 11p15, we performed dosage analyses of the insulin and IGF-II genes in somatic DNAs of seven patients with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each case, we observed apparent diploid representation of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that BWS is not frequently associated with small duplications of 11p15 material that embed the insulin and IGF-II genes </plain></SENT>
