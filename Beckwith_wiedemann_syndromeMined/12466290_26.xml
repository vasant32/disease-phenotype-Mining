<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The domain is thought to consist of the two subdomains Kip2 (p57(kip2))/Lit1 and Igf2/H19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because DNA methylation is believed to be a key factor in <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, we performed large-scale DNA methylation analysis to identify the cis-element crucial for the regulation of the Kip2/Lit1 subdomain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten CpG islands (CGIs) were found, and these were located at the promoter sites, upstream of genes, and within intergenic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">Bisulphite</z:chebi> sequencing revealed that CGIs 4, 5, 8, and 10 were differentially methylated regions (DMRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CGIs 4, 5, and 10 were methylated paternally in somatic tissues but not in germ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CGI8 was methylated in oocyte and maternally in somatic tissues during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Parental-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSSs) were found near CGI8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that CGI8, called DMR-Lit1, is not only the region for gametic methylation but might also be the imprinting control region (ICR) of the subdomain </plain></SENT>
