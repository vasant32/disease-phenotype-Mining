<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of this condition has been described in 86 cases, the underlying cellular origin is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigate the placental cell type involved in a case of PMD associated with a live born female infant with IUGR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In PMD intermediate villi contain cisternae, lined by non-proliferative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining reveals they are not of trophoblast or vascular endothelial origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is positive immunostaining for lymphatic endothelium; this <z:mp ids='MP_0008778'>abnormal lymphangiogenesis</z:mp> is in concordance with current hypotheses regarding the aetiology of PMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, such observations suggest that placental villous mesenchyme may differentiate into various cell types, even those not normally found in the human placenta </plain></SENT>
