<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten sets of MZ twins with WBS have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of these have been female and in each case the twins were discordant for the WBS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tenth set was male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were concordant for WBS and both had a duplication of chromosome 15 which they shared in common with their phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The WBS gene has been assigned to the locus 11p15 and there appear to be several different genetic mechanisms involving this locus which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> give rise to WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An imprinting effect for the WBS gene has been proposed because of the transmission of the gene preferentially through the maternal line in some large pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We describe two further sets of female MZ twins with WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One pair is concordant and one discordant for the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possible genetic mechanisms involved in the expression of WBS are discussed, with particular reference to twinning, <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> and X-inactivation which is thought to be associated with the occurrence of MZ twinning in females </plain></SENT>
