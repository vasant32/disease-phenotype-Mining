<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The preimplantation embryos of a range of mammals can be susceptible to disruptions in <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> mechanisms, resulting in loss of imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such disruptions can have developmental consequences involving foetal and placental growth such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> in humans and large offspring syndrome in sheep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate the dynamics of establishing monoallelic expression of individual sheep imprinted genes post-fertilisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to amplify cDNA from the sheep blastocyst, day 21 foetus and day 21 chorioallantois, to compare expression levels between biparental and <z:mp ids='MP_0009443'>parthenogenetic embryos</z:mp> in order to indicate allelic expression status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In common with other mammals, IGF2, PEG1 and PEG3 were paternally expressed in the day 21 conceptus, while H19, IGF2R, GRB10 and p57KIP were maternally expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, GNAS was maternally expressed in the foetus, but paternally expressed in the chorioallantois at day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the imprinting of ovine GRB10 and IGF2R was comparable with mouse but not with human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the trophoblast-restricted maternal expression in both mouse and human, SASH2 (sheep homologue of Mash2/HASH2) was expressed in the ovine foetus and was biallelically expressed in the chorioallantois </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differential methylation of the H19 CTCF III upstream region and IGF2R DMR2 in the chorioallantois revealed predominantly paternal and maternal methylation respectively, indicating conservation of these imprinting regulatory regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In blastocysts, IGF2R, GRB10 and SASH2 were expressed biallelically, while the other genes were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, for the majority of ovine imprinted genes examined, monoallelic expression does not occur until after the blastocyst stage </plain></SENT>
