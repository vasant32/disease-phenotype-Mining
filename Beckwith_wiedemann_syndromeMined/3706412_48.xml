<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe 18 individuals from five unrelated families with various manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pedigree analysis was performed on the 5 families and on another 19 families in the literature, each of which included more than one affected person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following findings were obtained: 1) the clinical manifestations among the affected individuals were highly variable--those obvious in infancy tended to become less distinct with increasing age; 2) the syndrome was transmitted directly and vertically through three generations in four families, and through two generations in seven families; 3) male-to-male transmission was noted once; 4) the sex ratio in the affected individuals was not significantly different from 1; 5) the segregation ratio of the trait among the sibs of the probands was 0.571 +/- 0.066; 6) the affected + carrier/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ratio was one among the offspring of the affected individuals and obligate carriers; 7) phenotrance (the expected presence of the trait in a generation) of the syndrome in the sibship of probands was complete, whereas that in earlier generations appeared low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy is attributable to the lessening of the clinical features with increasing age as well as to a possibly less aggressive search for abnormalities in older generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the syndrome is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable expressivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-resolution chromosome banding analysis in seven affected individuals and their respective parents showed no abnormalities </plain></SENT>
