<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent alteration associated with BWS is the absence of methylation at the maternal allele of KvDMR1, an intronic CpG island within the KCNQ1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Targeted deletion of KvDMR1 suggests that this locus is an imprinting control region (ICR) that regulates multiple genes in 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell culture based enhancer blocking assays indicate that KvDMR1 may function as a methylation modulated chromatin insulator and/or silencer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential consequence of loss of methylation (LOM) at KvDMR1 in the development of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The steady state levels of CDKN1C gene expression in fibroblast cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, and from persons with BWS who have LOM at KvDMR1, was determined by both real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the CDKN1C promoter region was assessed by Southern hybridisation using a methylation sensitive restriction endonuclease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both qPCR and RPA clearly demonstrated a marked decrease (86-93%) in the expression level of the CDKN1C gene in cells derived from patients with BWS, who had LOM at KvDMR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Southern analysis indicated that downregulation of CDKN1C in these patients was not associated with hypermethylation at the presumptive CDKN1C promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An epimutation at KvDMR1, the absence of maternal methylation, causes the aberrant silencing of CDKN1C, some 180 kb away on the maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar to mutations at this locus, this silencing may give rise to BWS </plain></SENT>
