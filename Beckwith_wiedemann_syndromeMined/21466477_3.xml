<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IGF system, and more particularly IGF2, is one of the most important <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> and paracrine growth systems regulating fetal and placental growth (reviewed in [1]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IGF2 gene is regulated by <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> and is expressed only from the paternally-inherited allele in most tissues during fetal development and after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes are tightly regulated and are therefore particularly susceptible to changes, including environmental and nutritional changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of a cluster of imprinted genes, including the IGF2 gene within the 11p15 region, results in two fetal growth disorders (Silver-Russell and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e>) with opposite growth phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those two syndromes are model imprinting disorders to decipher the regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
