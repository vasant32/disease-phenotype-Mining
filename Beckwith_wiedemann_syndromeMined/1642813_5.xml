<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the somatometric data the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range was set out at mean +/- 2 SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relevant physical findings were a characteristic face, non increased mean height and weight, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> head circumference, defective abdominal wall, a predominance of the upper segment, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002982'>tibial bowing</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>Mental retardation</z:hpo> was documented in 5 cases but in only 1 it was related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 32 cases karyotyped were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is frequent (34.3% in our series) and potentially deleterious for the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> we propose to monitor the glycemia every 6 h during the first 3 days in WBS newborns in order to correct glycemia below of 2.6 mmol/l (46.8 mg/dl) according to recent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparison with previous large series enabled us to precise the frequency, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and evolution of the main stigmata </plain></SENT>
