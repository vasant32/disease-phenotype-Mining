<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Development of the mammalian secondary palate involves a series of epithelial mesenchymal interactions: during one of these, a mesenchymal signal specifies regionally distinct palatal epithelial differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extracellular matrix molecules and soluble growth factors may be involved in this signalling process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have mapped the expression of the genes for insulin-like growth factors (IGF I and II), the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> they encode, and the IGF binding protein 1 (IGF BP-1) during murine palatogenesis (embryonic days (E) 12-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IGF-I gene expression was below detectable levels in the craniofacial region at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IGF-I <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was at the threshold of immunocytochemical detection and widely distributed in the palatal mesenchyme, decreasing in staining intensity from E12 to E14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, IGF-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was intensely localised in several tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IGF-II gene expression within the forming palate was developmentally regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the vertical palatal shelves (E12 to E13) IGF-II gene expression was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On early E14, in the horizontal prefusion palate, significant expression was present in the palatal mesenchyme, but not the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Once palatal fusion had occurred, mesenchymal expression fell rapidly to undetectable levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IGF-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was next detectable in the secondary palate on late E15 at sites of membranous bone formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By contrast to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> distribution, IGF-II <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was localised predominantly in the palatal epithelia (particularly the nasal and medial edge epithelia) but also in the mesenchyme of the E14 prefusion palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significantly, the IGF binding protein had a similar distribution pattern to the IGF-II <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, the developing tongue myotubes labelled heavily for IGF-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, protein and binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that IGF-II may play a localised paracrine role during murine palatogenesis, perhaps in the mesenchymal signalling of epithelial differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>IGF-II may also serve to coordinate the development of the tongue and palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The distribution of IGF-II <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was very similar to that of TGF-beta, suggesting a possible interactive role of these growth factors during palate development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Finally, evidence that the IGF-II gene is imprinted (Ferguson-Smith et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>1991) and may be the target for <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (Henry et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>1991), which is characterised by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of tissues (especially the tongue) expressing IGF II in the embryo, indicates the necessity of reanalysing human <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> families for disruption (including <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>) of the genes encoding IGFs, their receptors and binding proteins </plain></SENT>
