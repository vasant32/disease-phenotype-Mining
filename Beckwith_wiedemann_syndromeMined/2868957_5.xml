<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> cells were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively with the indirect immunofluorescence method and morphometry was used to establish the volume density of the four <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This evaluation showed a marked increase of insulin and glucagon cells and a lesser augmentation of pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> cells and somatostatin cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the percent of somatostatin cells was decreased in comparison with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Qualitatively, the two pancreas were characterized by the lack of segregation of glucagon and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> cells to distinct parts of the gland, with each cell type being abundant in the pancreatic region in which they are normally very sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The marked increase of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells often took the form of giant islet-like structures formed by smaller subunits; however, despite this increase, the distribution of insulin cells respected the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern, i.e. clusters of B cells surrounded by non-B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that besides the proliferation of pancreatic <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells maintaining a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> topographical distribution of B versus non-B cells, the pancreas of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> may have undergone abnormal development with a consequent lack of segregation of glucagon and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> cells to different parts of the gland </plain></SENT>
