<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a first step in further defining the involvement of this chromosomal region in these various maladies, a library was constructed from the specific microdissection of chromosomal fragments representing 11p15.5-pter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 98 microclones analyzed, 31 identified single copy human DNA sequences, 21 of which mapped to 11p15.5 while 10 mapped proximal to the HBBC locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of the 11p15.5-positioned microprobes detected restriction fragment length polymorphisms at their homologous genomic loci for various enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These microprobes are now being utilized in several ways in order to address the underlying basis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and its associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
