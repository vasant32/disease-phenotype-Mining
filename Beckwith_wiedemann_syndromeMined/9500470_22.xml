<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously identified a cluster of imprinted genes on human chromosome 11p15.5, a region involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>, and ovarian, breast, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that TSSC3, which is homologous to the mouse <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> gene TDAG51 and maps to this region, is imprinted and expressed from the maternal allele in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This result is important for three reasons: (a) TSSC3 is the first <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related gene in any species found to be imprinted; (b) it is located within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor region of 11p15; and (c) it lies within 15 kb of the nonimprinted gene hNAP2, thus defining a small boundary interval between imprinted and nonimprinted genes on 11p </plain></SENT>
