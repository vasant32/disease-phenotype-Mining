<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rarely, chromosomal translocations or inversions of chromosome 11p15.5 are associated with BWS but the molecular pathophysiology in such cases is not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our series of 3 translocation and 2 inversion patients with BWS, the chromosome 11p15.5 breakpoints map within the centromeric imprinted domain, 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that either microdeletions/microduplications adjacent to the breakpoints could disrupt genomic sequences important for imprinted gene regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An alternate hypothesis was that epigenetic alterations of as yet unknown regulatory DNA sequences, result in the BWS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high resolution Nimblegen custom microarray was designed representing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-repetitive sequences in the telomeric 33 Mb of the short arm of human chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the BWS-associated chromosome 11p15.5 translocations and inversions, we found no evidence of microdeletions/microduplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation was also tested on this microarray using the HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR (HELP) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This high-resolution DNA methylation microarray analysis revealed a gain of DNA methylation in the translocation/inversion patients affecting the p-ter segment of chromosome 11p15, including both imprinted domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BWS patients that inherited a maternal translocation or inversion also demonstrated reduced expression of the growth suppressing imprinted gene, CDKN1C in Domain 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data demonstrate that translocations and inversions involving imprinted domain 2 on chromosome 11p15.5, alter regional DNA methylation patterns and imprinted gene expression in cis, suggesting that these epigenetic alterations are generated by an alteration in "chromatin context" </plain></SENT>
