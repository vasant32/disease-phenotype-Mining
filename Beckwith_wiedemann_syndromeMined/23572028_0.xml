<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The children's mothers and a third sister were tall statured (178, 185 and 187 cm) and one had mild BWS features as a child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their parents had average heights of 173 cm (mother) and 180 cm (father) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This second generation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo> and third generation BWS correlated with increased methylation of the maternal H19/IGF2-locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were obtained by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> treatment and subclone Sanger sequencing or next generation sequencing to quantitate the degree of CpG-methylation on three locations: the H19 promoter region and two CTCF binding sites in the H19 imprinting control region (ICR1), specifically in ICR1 repeats B1 and B7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon ICR1 copy number analysis and sequencing, the same maternal point variant NCBI36:11:g.1979595T&gt;C that had been described previously as a cause of BWS in three brothers, was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As expected, this point variant was on the paternal allele in the non-affected grandmother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This nucleotide variant has been shown to affect OCTamer-binding transcription factor-4 (OCT4) binding, which may be necessary for maintaining the unmethylated state of the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data extend these findings by showing that the OCT4 binding site mutation caused incomplete switching from paternal to maternal ICR1 methylation imprint, and that upon further maternal transmission, methylation of the incompletely demethylated variant ICR1 allele was further increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that maternal and paternal ICR1 alleles are treated differentially in the female germline, and only the paternal allele appears to be capable of demethylation.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 10 April 2013; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2013.71 </plain></SENT>
