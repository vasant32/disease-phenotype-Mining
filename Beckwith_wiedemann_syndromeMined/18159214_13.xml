<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 30% of patients, the differentially methylated IGF2/H19 imprinting center region (ICR1) on chromosome 11p15 was found to be hypomethylated, as determined by Southern blot analysis of an HpaII restriction site close to the third CTCF-binding site (CTS3) within ICR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> treatment and a real-time PCR-based methylation assay (QAMA), we analyzed the third and sixth CTCF-binding sites (CTS3, CTS6) in 5 patients with CTS3 hypomethylation, in 14 patients who were suspected to have SRS but were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by Southern blot analysis, and in 1 patient with body asymmetry without any other features of SRS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients with CTS3 hypomethylation, in 5 of 14 patients who were judged to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at CTS3 by Southern blot analysis and in the patient with isolated body asymmetry, we found CTS3 and CTS6 hypomethylation by QAMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA), we obtained similar results at four additional ICR1 sites in the CTS6 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results show that ICR1 hypomethylation occurs more often in SRS patients than as previously thought as well as in isolated hemihypoplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that methylation analysis by QAMA and MLPA is more sensitive in detecting ICR1 hypomethylation than Southern blot analysis of CTS3 </plain></SENT>
