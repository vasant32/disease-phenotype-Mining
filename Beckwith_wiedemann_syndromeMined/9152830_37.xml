<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BWS is a genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder; most cases are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> but approximately 15% are familial and a small number of BWS patients have cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosome 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>Genomic imprinting</z:mp> effects have been implicated in familial and non-familial BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the molecular pathology of 106 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS cases; 17% (14/83) of informative cases had <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) for chromosome 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each case UPD appeared to result from a postzygotic event resulting in mosaicism for segmental paternal isodisomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The critical region for isodisomy was refined to a 25 cM interval between D11S861 and D11S2071 which contained the IGF2, H19, and p57(KIP2) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three cases isodisomy for 11q markers was detected but this did not extend further than 11q13-q21 suggesting that complete chromosome 11 disomy may not produce a BWS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The allele specific methylation status of the H19 gene was investigated in 80 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 cases with UPD tested displayed hypermethylation consistent with an excess of paternal H19 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, five of 63 (8%) cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> had H19 hypermethylation consistent with an "imprinting centre" mutation (ICM) or "imprinting error" (IE) lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of patients with putative ICM/IE mutations was variable and overlapped with that of non-UPD <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> H19 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) more common in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings may indicate differential effects on the expression of imprinted genes in chromosome 11p15 according to the precise molecular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Analysis of H19 methylation is useful for the diagnosis of both UPD or altered imprinting in BWS and shows that a variety of molecular mechanisms may cause relaxation of IGF2 imprinting in BWS </plain></SENT>
