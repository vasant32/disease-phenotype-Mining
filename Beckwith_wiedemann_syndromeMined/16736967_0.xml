<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the most common features which can help in prenatal diagnosing of that condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 3 fetuses diagnosed with BWS, referred for echocardiographic evaluation had been examined in referral centre from 2003-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean gestational age at the diagnosis was 31 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During ultrasound evaluation characteristic features were recognized: macrosomy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, nephromegaly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, polyhydramnion was associated in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defect</z:hpo> and any functional changes were found during ECHO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case prenatal karyotyping was performed and revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postnatal karyotyping in remain two cases was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in one and abnormal in second case (Moz 46XX (13/46XX-18, +MAR5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prenatal diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> can be obtained based on characteristic ultrasound features in the third trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most common features of BWS diagnosed in prenatal ultrasound included: macrosomy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003271'>visceromegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In utero diagnosis is important for further mode and time of delivery planning, also neonates' clinical condition directly after delivery and long-term postnatal prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping is recommened in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of BWS </plain></SENT>
