<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the first evidence, to our knowledge, that ART is associated with a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome-namely, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study, the prevalence of ART was 4.6% (3 of 65), versus the background rate of 0.8% in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of seven children with BWS were born after ART-five of whom were conceived after intracytoplasmic sperm injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies of six of the children indicate that five of the six have specific epigenetic alterations associated with BWS-four at LIT1 and one at both LIT1 and H19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We discuss the implications of our finding that ART is associated with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, similar to the large offspring syndrome reported in ruminants </plain></SENT>
