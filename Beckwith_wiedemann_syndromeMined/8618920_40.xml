<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously found that BWS is genetically linked to 11p15 and that this same band shows loss of heterozygosity in the types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> to which children with BWS are susceptible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, 11p15 contains &gt; 20 megabases, and therefore, the BWS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes could be distinct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the precise physical relationship between these loci, we isolated yeast artificial chromosomes, and cosmid libraries from them, within the region of loss of heterozygosity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002898'>embryonal tumors</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five germ-line balanced chromosomal rearrangement breakpoint sites from BWS patients, as well as a balanced chromosomal translocation breakpoint from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206743" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rhabdoid tumor</z:e>, were isolated within a 295- to 320-kb cluster defined by a complete cosmid contig crossing these breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This breakpoint cluster terminated approximately 100 kb centromeric to the imprinted gene IGF2 and 100 kb telomeric to p57KIP2, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, and was located within subchromosomal transferable fragments that suppressed the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">embryonal tumor</z:e> cells in genetic complementation experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have identified 11 transcribed sequences in this BWS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor coincident region, one of which corresponded to p57KIP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, three additional BWS breakpoints were &gt; 4 megabases centromeric to the other five breakpoints and were excluded from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor region defined by subchromosomal transferable fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, multiple genetic loci define BWS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppression on 11p15 </plain></SENT>
