<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human chromosome 11p15, and the syntenic region on mouse distal chromosome 7, contain several imprinted genes, including p57 (KIP2) ( CDKN1C ) and IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These two genes, which are separated by &gt;700 kb, are both implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that an Igf2/H19 transgene is expressed appropriately and can imprint at ectopic chromosomal locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the p57 (KIP2) region, we similarly tested the imprinting and function of a 38 kb human genomic fragment containing the p57 (KIP2) gene in transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This transgene showed appropriate tissue-specific expression and transgene copy number-dependent expression at ectopic sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the levels of expression are reminiscent of that found for the paternal allele in humans (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no change in expression levels when the transgene was inherited from the maternal germline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the cis -elements required for enhanced expression of the maternally inherited p57 (KIP2) allele lie at a distance from the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding has important implications for the role of this gene in the human disease, in particular with respect to the translocation breakpoints identified in some patients </plain></SENT>
