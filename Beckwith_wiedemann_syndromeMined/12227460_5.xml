<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To provide further information, clinical and biochemical information was obtained on women with maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo>, on their pregnancies and on the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This information included blood sulphur amino acids and total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, CbetaS gene mutations and developmental and cognitive scores in the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study involved 15 pregnancies in 11 women, of whom 5 were <z:chebi fb="5" ids="16709">pyridoxine</z:chebi>-nonresponsive and 6 were <z:chebi fb="5" ids="16709">pyridoxine</z:chebi>-responsive </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One pregnancy was terminated and two pregnancies resulted in first-trimester <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 12 pregnancies produced live-born infants with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or above-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> birth measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One offspring has multiple congenital anomalies that include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000612'>colobomas of the iris</z:hpo> and choroid, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010301'>neural tube defect</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>undescended testes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between the severity of the biochemical abnormalities or the therapies during pregnancy to either the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> or the offspring outcomes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a cautious approach would include careful monitoring of these pregnancies with attention to metabolic therapy and possibly anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
