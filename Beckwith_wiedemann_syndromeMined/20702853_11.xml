<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) are becoming increasingly prevalent and are generally considered to be safe medical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, evidence indicates that embryo culture may adversely affect the developmental potential and overall health of the embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the least studied but most important areas in this regard is the effects of embryo culture on epigenetic phenomena, and on <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> in particular, because assisted reproduction has been linked to development of the human imprinting disorders Angelman and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed side-by-side comparisons of five commercial embryo culture systems (KSOMaa, Global, Human Tubal Fluid, Preimplantation 1/Multiblast, and G1v5PLUS/G2v5PLUS) in relation to a best-case (in vivo-derived embryos) and a worst-case (Whitten culture) scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imprinted DNA methylation and expression were examined at three well-studied loci, H19, Peg3, and Snrpn, in mouse embryos cultured from the 2-cell to the blastocyst stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that embryo culture in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> commercial media systems resulted in imprinted methylation loss compared to in vivo-derived embryos, although some media systems were able to maintain imprinted methylation levels more similar to those of in vivo-derived embryos in comparison to embryos cultured in Whitten medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> media systems exhibited loss of imprinted H19 expression comparable to that using Whitten medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment of superovulation and embryo culture resulted in increased perturbation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, above that from culture alone, indicating that multiple ART procedures further disrupt <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that time in culture and number of ART procedures should be minimized to ensure fidelity of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> during preimplantation development </plain></SENT>
