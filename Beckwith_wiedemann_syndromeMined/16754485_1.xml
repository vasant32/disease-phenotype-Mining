<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologic studies of WBS show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_499'>nesidioblastosis</z:mpath> of the pancreas, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008186'>adrenocortical cytomegaly</z:hpo>, and persistent metanephric blastema of the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the human 11p15.5 region is the locus of abnormality in WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-2) frequently has been considered a candidate gene, and expression of IGF-2 is known to be significantly delayed in fetal skeletal muscle of double-muscle (DM) cattle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other candidate genes recently have been proposed for WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of recessive alleles in the bovine myostatin gene (GDF8, mapped to bovine chromosome 2 and apparently orthologous to the human 2q22 region) have been shown to be responsible for DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently the first human case of deficient GDF8 function has been reported, confirming the importance of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bovine IGF-2 has been sequenced and localized to chromosome 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary purpose of this study was to compare and contrast histologic findings in DM and WBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining confirms changes similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_499'>nesidioblastosis</z:mpath> in the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other dysplastic changes of a cystic nature are seen in the adrenal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The renal histology of DM fetuses did not appear significantly different than controls </plain></SENT>
