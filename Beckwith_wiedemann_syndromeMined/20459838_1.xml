<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several imprinted genes have been implicated in the process of placentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distal region of mouse chromosome 7 (Chr 7) contains at least ten imprinted genes, several of which are expressed from the maternal homologue in the placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The corresponding paternal alleles of these genes are silenced in cis by an incompletely understood mechanism involving the formation of a repressive nuclear compartment mediated by the long non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> Kcnq1ot1 initiated from imprinting centre 2 (IC2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether some maternally expressed genes are silenced on the paternal homologue via a Kcnq1ot1-independent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of a large truncation of Chr7 encompassing the entire IC2-regulated domain (DelTel7 allele) leads to <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> at mid-gestation accompanied by severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_100'>placental abnormalities</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kcnq1ot1 expression can be abolished on the paternal chromosome by deleting IC2 (IC2KO allele) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the IC2KO mutation is paternally inherited, epigenetic silencing is lost in the region and the DelTel7 <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> is rescued in compound heterozygotes, leading to viable DelTel7/IC2KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Considering the important functions of several IC2-regulated genes in placentation, we set out to determine whether these DelTel7/IC2KO rescued conceptuses develop <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> placentae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We report no abnormalities with respect to the architecture and vasculature of the DelTel7/IC2KO rescued placentae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Imprinted expression of several of the IC2-regulated genes critical to placentation is also faithfully recapitulated in DelTel7/IC2KO placentae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the distal chromosome 7 imprinted genes implicated in placental function are silenced by IC2 and Kcnq1ot1 on the paternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the methylated maternal IC2 is not required for the regulation of nearby genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results show the potential for fully rescuing LQ trans <z:mpath ids='MPATH_100'>placental abnormalities</z:mpath> that are caused by imprinting defects </plain></SENT>
