<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a follow-up study on 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS)</z:e> to further clarify major and minor diagnostic clinical characteristics and longterm expectations for growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found patients with WBS tended to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006267'>large placentas</z:hpo> which were almost twice <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> placental weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The large fetal size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> often resulted in early delivery with occasional perinatal mortality (three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased placental size, with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> resulting in excessive umbilical cord length, may be useful in suspecting WBS prior to delivery, thereby facilitating perinatal management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defects</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> may help to confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At birth, patients were almost 2 standard deviations above the expected mean for gestational age, length, and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This trend continued through early childhood and then excessive size became less dramatic with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We detected no cytogenetic variations in nine patients who had studies done and, to date, no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have been detected other than a gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo> that was evident in one infant at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Longitudinally, the children have not had an unusual incidence of medical problems, and long-term ultrasound monitoring was not burdensome to the families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In comparison, mental and social development to unaffected siblings and cousins appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
