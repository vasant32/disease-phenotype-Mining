<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An identity-by-descent analysis in a family with IMAGe syndrome identified a 17.2-Mb locus on chromosome 11p15 that segregated in the affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Targeted exon array capture of the disease locus, followed by high-throughput genomic sequencing and validation by dideoxy sequencing, identified missense mutations in the imprinted gene CDKN1C (also known as P57KIP2) in two familial and four unrelated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A familial analysis showed an imprinted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> in which only maternal transmission of the mutation resulted in IMAGe syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CDKN1C inhibits cell-cycle progression, and we found that targeted expression of IMAGe-associated CDKN1C mutations in Drosophila caused severe eye growth defects compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> CDKN1C, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism </plain></SENT>
