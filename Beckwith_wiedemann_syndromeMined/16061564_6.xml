<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the imprinted gene CDKN1C account for approximately 10% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts from BWS patients with loss of methylation (LOM) at the imprinting control region (ICR) KvDMR1 have reduced CDKN1C expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another group of BWS patients with downregulated CDKN1C expression but with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation at KvDMR1 has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of CDKN1C silencing in BWS in these two classes of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The CDKN1C promoter region was analysed for changes in DNA methylation using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> sequencing, and for alterations in chromatin structure using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was only spurious CpG methylation of the CDKN1C promoter in fibroblast DNA from both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and patients with BWS, irrespective of the methylation status of KvDMR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no detectable change in chromatin structure at the CDKN1C promoter in patients with LOM at KvDMR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BWS patients with downregulated CDKN1C and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation at KvDMR1 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of dimethylated H3-K4 and enrichment of dimethylated H3-K9 and HP1gamma at the CDKN1C promoter, suggesting that in these cases gene silencing is associated with repressive chromatin changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CDKN1C may be downregulated by multiple mechanisms including some that do not involve promoter methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In BWS patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation at KvDMR1 and reduced expression of CDKN1C, repressive chromatin may play a role, but the absence of methylation and repressive chromatin structure at the CDKN1C promoter in BWS patients with LOM at KvDMR1 argues for a direct role of this epimutation in silencing CDKN1C </plain></SENT>
