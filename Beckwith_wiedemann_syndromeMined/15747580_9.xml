<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mammalian genes subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> often form clusters and are regulated by long-range mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distal imprinted domain of mouse chromosome 7 is orthologous to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> domain in human chromosome 11p15.5 and contains at least 13 imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This domain consists of two subdomains, which are respectively regulated by an imprinting center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We here report the finished-quality sequence of a 0.6-Mb region encompassing the more centromeric subdomain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sequence contains four imprinted genes (Ascl2/Mash2, Ins2, Igf2 and H19) and reveals previously unidentified CpG islands and tandem repeats, which may be features of imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, a unique 210-kb segment consisting almost exclusively of tandem repeats and retroelements is identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This segment, located between Th and Ins2, has features of heterochromatin-forming DNA and is highly methylated at CpG sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The segment exhibits asynchronous replication on the parental chromosomes, a feature of the imprinted domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that this repeat segment could serve either as a boundary between the two subdomains or as a target for epigenetic chromatin modifications that regulate imprinting </plain></SENT>
