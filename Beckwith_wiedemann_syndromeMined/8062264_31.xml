<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The highest birth weights were found not only in patients diagnosed with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (mean, 3.78 kg), as had been expected, but also in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> (3.80 kg) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011796'>perilobar nephrogenic rests</z:hpo> (3.56 kg) in addition to their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among more than 3000 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>, heights and weights at diagnosis were significantly higher for the subgroups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo>, and height was lower for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo> or characteristic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">genitourinary anomalies</z:e>, when compared to other patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
