<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe three cases of placental mesenchymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (PMD) associated with abnormal karyotype and review the cases reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cases were retrieved from the files of three different institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A search of the English language literature was performed using Medline database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_100'>Placental abnormalities</z:mpath> suggestive of molar changes were seen on the prenatal ultrasound scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the cases had large, hydropic stem villi with myxomatous stroma, cistern formation and 'chorangiomatoid' changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The placental and fetal karyotypes identified were <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 (47,XX,t(1:13)(q32;q32)+ 13); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Klinefelter syndrome</z:e> (47,XXY) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">triploidy</z:e> (69,XXX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Including these 3 cases, of 66 reported cases, 51 (78%) were female and 14 (22%) male (ratio 3.6:1); the karyotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 32/36 (89%) and abnormal in 4/36 (11%); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> was confirmed or suspected in 15/66 (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excluding termination of pregnancies, intrauterine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 18/54 (33%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Molar ultrasonographic appearances associated with increased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, or slightly elevated, levels of ss human Chorionic Gonadotrophin should raise the clinical suspicion of PMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of this condition should not be disregarded when an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266652" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abnormal fetus</z:e> and/or an abnormal karyotype are demonstrated </plain></SENT>
