<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The paternal repression of several genes in human chromosome 11p15.5 (mouse chromosome 7) is associated with paternal expression of a transcript called KCNQ1OT1 (also known as LIT1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This long transcript originates from a promoter that resides in a CpG island in intron 10 of the KCNQ1 gene and runs in an antisense orientation to the direction of the coding KCNQ1 transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CpG island is maternally methylated but paternally nonmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CpG island loses its maternal methylation in over 50% of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> who lack <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This loss is usually accompanied by biallelic expression of the KCNQ1OT1 transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have examined the methylation status of this CpG island in somatic cell hybrids and diploid lymphoblasts using Southern hybridization and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We find that the maternal copy of the CpG island is methylated at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CpGs examined within the CpG island and uniformly paternally unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, in BWS patients who have lost methylation of the CpG island, this loss occurs throughout the CpG island </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we find that there is a switch in methylation patterns outside the CpG island from maternal methylation within the island to predominantly paternal methylation at sites flanking the CpG island </plain></SENT>
