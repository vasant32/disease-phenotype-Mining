<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We interviewed families of 71 patients registered in the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms Tumor</z:hpo> Study and identified as having a twin sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Questions concerning zygosity and the occurrence of congenital anomalies and other forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the twins were asked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 71 twin pairs, 35 were dizygotic, 31 were monozygotic, and 5 were of unknown zygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only pair concordant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> was dizygotic, leading to a heritability estimate of zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a monozygotic pair, one twin was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> and the other with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> in the co-twin was 250 times and 10 times the population rate, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four discordant pairs had a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo>, suggesting that the penetrance of the condition is not complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the small sample size, caution should be exercised in the interpretation of these results </plain></SENT>
