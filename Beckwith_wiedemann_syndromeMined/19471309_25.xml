<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is an increased prevalence of imprinting disorders, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, associated with human assisted reproductive technologies (ART) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Work on animal models suggests that in vitro culture may be the source of these imprinting errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in this study we report that, in some cases, the errors are inherited from the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed DNA methylation at seven autosomal imprinted loci and the XIST locus in 78 paired DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In seven out of seventeen cases where there was <z:mp ids='MP_0008877'>abnormal DNA methylation</z:mp> in the ART sample (41%), the identical alterations were present in the parental sperm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we also identified DNA sequence variations in the gene encoding DNMT3L, which were associated with the abnormal paternal DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the imprinting errors and the DNA sequence variants were more prevalent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000798'>oligospermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the increase in the incidence of imprinting disorders in individuals born by ART may be due, in some cases, to the use of sperm with intrinsic imprinting mutations </plain></SENT>
