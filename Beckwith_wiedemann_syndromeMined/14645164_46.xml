<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, the significance and implications of these findings are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that, although such imprinting disorders may be shown to be only rare complications of ART, epigenetic errors might account for a much wider spectrum of ART-related complications than is recognized currently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Addressing these questions should be a priority for research on cohorts of ART children </plain></SENT>
