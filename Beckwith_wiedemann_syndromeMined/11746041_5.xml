<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS)</z:e> is defined by a group of anomalies, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo>, and ear creases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several minor anomalies have also been reported in the syndrome, including posterior helical ear pits (PHEP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two independent linkage studies of pedigrees with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> have shown linkage of WBS to 11p15.5 markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further confirming the location of WBS to this location is the finding of 11p15.5 duplications and translocations, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> for a small area of 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, members of previously described families exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> of the PHEP phenotype were genotyped for three markers in the 11p15.5 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These three markers were in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF2), insulin (INS), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data were examined by linkage analysis using the same genetic model used previously to demonstrate linkage of WBS to markers on chromosome 11p15.5: an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> model with a penetrance of 0.90 and a gene frequency of 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one large pedigree, linkage analysis of the 11p15.5 markers excluded the PHEP phenotype from the IGF2, INS, and TH region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the four other pedigrees examined, the marker loci were not sufficiently informative or the pedigrees did not provide sufficient power to exclude linkage from this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The strongest evidence against linkage of the PHEP phenotype to 11p15.5 was evident by inspection of the segregation of the haplotypes of the markers in the pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In two informative pedigrees, relatives with the PHEP phenotype did not share the same haplotype of markers identical by descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the PHEP phenotype is not linked to chromosome 11p15.5 in the informative families tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the families examined, there are not enough individuals with WBS to determine if WBS was linked to 11p15.5 in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although locus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> has not been demonstrated in WBS, it is possible that a second WBS locus exists and that the PHEP phenotype in these families is linked to a second WBS locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the PHEP phenotype may occur independently of WBS so that the association of WBS and PHEP in our pedigrees may, in fact, represent causal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
