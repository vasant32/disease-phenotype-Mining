<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of several somatic cell hybrids containing various derivatives with deletions or translocations revealed that the human MyoD (MYF3) gene is not associated with the WAGR locus at chromosomal band 11p13 nor with the loss of the heterozygosity region at 11p15.5 related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subregional mapping by in situ hybridization with an myf3 specific probe shows that the gene resides at the chromosomal band 11p14, possibly at 11p14.3 </plain></SENT>
