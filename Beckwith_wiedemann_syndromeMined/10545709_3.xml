<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goals were (1) to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> quantitative chromosome abnormalities that appear in this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and (2) to compare the results with data from similar studies on other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the most commonly detected (&gt; 30%) chromosome abnormalities were gains of chromosomes 1, 2, 7, 8, and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Losses of chromosomes were found in only a few cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On comparing our results with those from studies on the BWS-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo>, it became clear that three chromosome regions, namely, 7q, 8q, and 17q, were the ones most commonly involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These regions, therefore, may harbor genes that play a role in the etiology of BWS-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in general </plain></SENT>
