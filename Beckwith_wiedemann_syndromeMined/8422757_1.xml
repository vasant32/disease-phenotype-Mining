<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using probes corresponding to the genes coding for MYOD1, CTSD, LDHA, and RBTN1 and to the anonymous sequence D11S776, we have reassessed the breakpoints of three hybrids (J1.10, BID7, and NYX3.1) and confirmed the localization or more precisely mapped these four genes and the anonymous DNA marker on different subregions of 11pter--&gt;p13, including the smallest region of 11p15.5 duplicated in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
