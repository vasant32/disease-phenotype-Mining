<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of 11p15 disturbances in the aetiology of Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is well established: in addition to hypomethylation of the H19/IGF2 differentially methylated regions, five patients with a duplication of maternal 11p15 material have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a boy with SRS carrying a maternally inherited duplication of chromosome 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient showed the typical clinical picture of SRS including severe intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004482'>relative macrocephaly</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011220'>prominent forehead</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000325'>triangular face</z:hpo>, down-turned corners of the mouth and fifth digit <z:mp ids='MP_0006253'>clinodactyly</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body asymmetry was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By molecular genetic analyses, MLPA and microsatellite typing detected a duplication of chromosome 11p15 and cytogenetic analysis showed an unbalanced translocation t(11;15)(p15.5:p12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The size of the duplicated region is approximately 8.8 Mb as determined by SNP-array analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The healthy mother carried a balanced reciprocal chromosome translocation t(11;15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is an increased risk for further children with SRS due to 11p15 duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the family is at risk for offspring with an 11p15 deletion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> whereby the phenotype will be influenced by haploinsufficiency of additional genes at 11p15 due to the deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The balanced aberrant karyotype was identified in several other family members, but interestingly there was no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e>, intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or multiple congenital anomaly syndromes in the family </plain></SENT>
