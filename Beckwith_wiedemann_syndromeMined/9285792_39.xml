<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The maintenance of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imprinting pattern in many loci has been shown to be essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development and adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, and some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorders</z:e>, exhibit loss of imprinting (LOI) in key genes such as insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) which often results in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which the genomic imprint is first established, then maintained, is not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in the case of IGF2, the expression of a neighbouring gene, H19, has been suggested to influence its transcription by competition for a common enhancer, thereby generating a mutually exclusive and allele-specific pattern of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associated changes in CpG methylation in discrete areas of both genes have been implicated in maintenance of the imprint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have examined the allele-specific expression of IGF2 and H19 in fibroblasts derived from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), a fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome associated with an imprinted locus on 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report that the majority of karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients show LOI of IGF2 with biallelic expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a proportion of these patients, loss of IGF2 imprinting was associated with complete suppression of H19 expression, as predicted by the enhancer competition model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in a significant number of cases, IGF2 showed biallelic expression even though H19 expression and methylation status were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This indicates that there must be an alternative H19-independent pathway by which allele-specific IGF2 expression is established or maintained </plain></SENT>
