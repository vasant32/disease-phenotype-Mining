<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of TSSC5 and other genes in the region is regulated through <z:mp ids='MP_0003123'>paternal imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TSSC5 encodes an efflux transporter-like protein with 10 transmembrane domains, whose regulation may affect drug sensitivity, cellular metabolism and growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we present evidences indicating that RING105, a novel conserved RING-finger protein with a PA (protease-associated) domain and a PEST sequence, is a ubiquitin ligase for TSSC5 that can function in concert with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The polyubiquitin target site on TSSC5 was mapped to a region in the 6th hydrophilic loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of RING105 in HeLa cells caused an accumulation of cells during G1 that was not observed with the expression of a form of RING105 in which a residue within the RING finger was mutated to inactivate its ligase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>UbcH6-RING105 may define a novel ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that targets TSSC5 in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
