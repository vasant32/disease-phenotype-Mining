<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a reported increased risk of intra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumors</z:e> in children with both syndromic (SH) and isolated idiopathic hemihyperplasia (IH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recommendations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> surveillance have been made, although there is no consensus for frequency and duration of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to review the incidence of abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in our pediatric population with SH and IH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the diagnostic criteria, imaging findings, and any associated syndrome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One of 10 patients with SH, a child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> resulting in a 10% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> incidence in patients with SH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the 250 (1.2%) children with IH developed an abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006744'>adrenal carcinoma</z:hpo> and the other 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumors</z:e> in both SH and IH, however, our incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with IH is lower than earlier reported studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this lower 1.2% incidence, the current literature on IH and available molecular genetic testing, it is reasonable to recommend referral of these patients to a clinical geneticist to identify subgroups with a higher risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development that are more likely to benefit from routine imaging surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
