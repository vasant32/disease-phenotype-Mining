<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant expression of multiple imprinted genes, including H19, IGF2, KCNQ1OT1, and CDKN1C, has been observed in BWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been estimated that mutations in CDKN1C occur in 12-17% of BWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have screened 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pedigrees and 65 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS cases by PCR/heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing and have identified four mutations, two of which were associated with biallelic IGF2 expression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> H19 and KCNQ1OT1 imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient demonstrated phenotypic expression of paternally transmitted mutation in this maternally expressed gene, a second proband is the child of one of a pair of monozygotic twin females who carry the mutation de novo, and a third patient exhibited unusual skeletal changes more commonly found in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When considered with other studies published to date, this work reveals the frequency of CDKN1C mutations in BWS to be only 4.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of an analysis of the imprinting status of genes in the 11p15 region where CDKN1C mutations were associated with loss of IGF2 imprinting and maintenance of H19 and KCNQ1OT1 imprinting </plain></SENT>
