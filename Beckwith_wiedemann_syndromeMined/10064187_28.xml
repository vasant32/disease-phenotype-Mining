<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> (BWS/HH) are at increased risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> and screening with abdominal sonography is frequently recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is a paucity of published data supporting this strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether sonographic screening at intervals of 4 months or less reduced the proportion of late-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms Tumor</z:hpo> (WT) in children with BWS/HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: A case series analysis was employed to compare the proportion of late-stage (stage III or IV) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> in patients with BWS/HH who were screened with sonography (n = 15) to the proportion of late-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> in unscreened patients with BWS/HH (n = 59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were identified from the BWS Registry and from previously published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Screened patients had sonograms at intervals of 4 months or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the 12 screened children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> had late-stage disease, whereas 25 of 59 (42%) of unscreened children had late-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo>, a difference that was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three children had false positive screening studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were operated on for suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> but the lesions proved to be complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000107'>renal cysts</z:hpo> (n = 2) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0008643'>nephroblastomatosis</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that children with BWS/HH may benefit from screening sonograms at intervals of 4 months or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, false positive screening exams may result in unnecessary surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given the rarity of BWS/HH, a larger, prospective international screening study is necessary to determine if the benefits of screening outweigh the risks </plain></SENT>
