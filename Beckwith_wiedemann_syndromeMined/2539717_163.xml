<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Constitutional deletions in the latter situation and similar alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumors</z:hpo> have implicated the chromosomal 11p13 region in neoplastic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, some <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases of WBS have been reported to have a constitutional duplication of chromosome 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to resolve this seeming paradox, we have analyzed a family segregating WBS for linkage to DNA markers mapped to chromosome 11p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consonant with the cytogenetic alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> WBS cases, we obtained evidence for tight linkage of the mutation causing the syndrome to markers located at 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also consistent with this localization, we identified a subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumors</z:hpo>, not associated with WBS, which have attained somatic homozygosity through mitotic recombination, with the smallest shared region of overlap being distal to the beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> complex at 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence that familial WBS likely results from a defect at the same genetic locus as does its <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, the data suggest there is another locus, distinct from that involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="WAGRO">WAGR syndrome</z:e>, which plays a role in the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> with WBS </plain></SENT>
