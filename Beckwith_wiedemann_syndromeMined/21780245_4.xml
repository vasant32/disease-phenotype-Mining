<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disruption of 11p15 imprinting results in two fetal growth disorders with opposite phenotypes: the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann</z:e> (BWS) and the Silver-Russell (SRS) syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various 11p15 genetic and epigenetic defects have been demonstrated in BWS and SRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, isolated DNA methylation defects account for approximately 60% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether cryptic copy number variations (CNVs) involving only part of one of the two imprinted domains account for 11p15 isolated DNA methylation defects, we designed a single nucleotide polymorphism array covering the whole 11p15 imprinted region and genotyped 185 SRS or BWS cases with loss or gain of DNA methylation at either ICR1 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe herein novel small gain and loss CNVs in six BWS or SRS patients, including maternally inherited cis-duplications involving only part of one of the two imprinted domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> deletions do not account for BWS with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> loss of methylation and that uniparental isodisomy involving only one of the two imprinted domains is not a mechanism for SRS or BWS </plain></SENT>
