<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) is a growth disorder for which an increased frequency of monozygotic (MZ) twinning has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With few exceptions, these twins are discordant for BWS and for females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the molecular and phenotypic analysis of 12 BWS twins and a triplet; seven twins are MZ, monochorionic and diamniotic, three twins are MZ, dichorionic and diamniotic and three twins are dizygotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve twins are female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the majority of the twin pairs (11 of 13), the defect on chromosome 11p15 was hypomethylation of the paternal allele of DMR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 5 of 10 twins, there was additional hypomethylation of imprinted loci; in most cases, the loci affected were maternally methylated, but in two cases, hypomethylation of the paternally methylated DLK1 and H19 DMRs was detected, a novel finding in BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In buccal swabs of the MZ twins who share a placenta, the defect was present only in the affected twin; comparable hypomethylation in lymphocytes was detected in both the twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of hypomethylation reached levels below 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The exchange of blood cells through vascular connections cannot fully explain the degree of hypomethylation found in the blood cell of the non-affected twin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose an additional mechanism through which sharing of aberrant methylation patterns in discordant twins, limited to blood cells, might occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a BWS-discordant MZ triplet, an intermediate level of demethylation was found in one of the non-affected sibs; this child showed mild signs of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the theory that a methylation error proceeds and possibly triggers the twinning process </plain></SENT>
