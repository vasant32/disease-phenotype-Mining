<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The finding of llp15 mutations in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> led to the identification of imprinted growth-promoting genes which are expressed paternally and of imprinted growth-suppressing genes in the same region that are expressed maternally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An opposite epimutation in the same region is associated with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> disorder characterised by a typical facial gestalt, <z:mp ids='MP_0006253'>clinodactyly</z:mp> V and asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In more than 30% of patients with SRS, hypomethylation of the telomeric llp15 imprinting domain (ICR1) can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the general significance of this epimutation for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> was unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a previous study' we showed that the ICR1 epimutation is not present in growth retarded patients with dysmorphisms not typical for SRS, but its role in the development of isolated growth restriction needed to be further elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We therefore screened 30 patients with isolated pre- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo> (IUGR/PNGR) and 65 patients diagnosed with SRS by external clinicians for ICR1I epimutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the latter group clinical data were rarely provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These 65 'SRS' patients were additionally analysed for maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> 7 (matUPD7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We excluded ICR1 hypomethylation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the SRS group, we detected four cases with ICR1 epimutation and three with matUPD7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By combining our data with those from our previous study we could show that the hypomethylation of ICR1 in llp15 is indeed restricted to patients with SRS features and can be disregarded in isolated IUGR/PNGR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, testing for the epimutation is indicated only in case of growth restriction in association with clinical signs reminiscent of SRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The low detection rate of the ICR1 epimutation in our 'SRS' group can be explained by the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of cases referred by external institutions </plain></SENT>
