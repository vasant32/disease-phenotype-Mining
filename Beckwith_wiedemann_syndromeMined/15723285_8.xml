<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on previous case series, we hypothesized that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> of a child with BWS was due to known risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> and gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A case cohort study using the BWS Registry at Washington University School of Medicine was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were pregnancies that resulted in the birth of a child with BWS, controls were pregnancies resulting in the birth of siblings without BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses of maternal complications and logistic regression to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children with BWS (n = 304) were delivered preterm at a significantly higher rate than their siblings (n = 269) odds ratio 19.1 (95% CI 9.1-40.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>Polyhydramnios</z:hpo>, gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and vaginal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> also occurred at high rates in the BWS group with odds ratios of 31.6 (95% CI 12.6-79.1), 2.4 (95% CI 1.4-4.1), and 3.9 (95% CI 2.3-6.4), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate logistic regression model within the BWS group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo>, vaginal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo>, odds ratios of 2.9 (95% CI 1.6-5.4), 2.6 (95% CI 1.3-5.0), and 5.3 (2.3-12.0), respectively </plain></SENT>
