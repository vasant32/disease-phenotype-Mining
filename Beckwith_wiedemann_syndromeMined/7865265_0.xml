<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 27 evaluable patients, 19 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilm's tumour</z:e> and one had massive bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0008643'>nephroblastomatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were more likely to occur on the side affected by hemihyperplasia than to be found contralaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but five of these patients developed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> before the age of six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of the 27 patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> associated with allelic loss on chromosome band 11p15, suggesting that the locus associated with hemihyperplasia may be also located at chromosome band 11p15 </plain></SENT>
