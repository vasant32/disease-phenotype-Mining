<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are believed to destabilise genomic imprints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increased frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> in children born after ART has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other, mostly epidemiological, studies argue against this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of ART on the stability of DNA methylation imprints, DNA was extracted from maternal peripheral blood (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPB</z:e>), umbilical cord blood (UCB) and amnion/chorion tissue (ACT) of 185 phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children (77 ICSI, 35 IVF, and 73 spontaneous conceptions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> based technologies 10 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were analysed, including KvDMR1, H19, SNRPN, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MEST</z:e>, GRB10, DLK1/MEG3 IG-DMR, GNAS NESP55, GNAS NESPas, GNAS XL-alpha-s and GNAS Exon1A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Methylation indices (MI) do not reveal any significant differences at nine DMRs among the conception groups in neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPB</z:e>, UCB nor in ACT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only slightly variable DMR was that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MEST</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here the mean MI was higher in UCB and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPB</z:e> of IVF cases (mean MI+/-SD: 0.41+/-0.03 (UCB) and 0.40+/-0.03 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPB</z:e>)) compared to the ICSI (0.38+/-0.03, p=0.003 (UCB); 0.37+/-0.04, p=0.0007 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPB</z:e>)) or spontaneous cases (0.38+/-0.03, p=0.003 (UCB); 0.38+/-0.04, p=0.02 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPB</z:e>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Weak but suggestive correlations between DMRs were, however, found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPB</z:e>, UCB and ACT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION This study supports the notion that children conceived by ART do not show a higher degree of imprint variability and hence do not have an a priori higher risk for imprinting disorders </plain></SENT>
