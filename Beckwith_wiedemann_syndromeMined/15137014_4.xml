<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis, prognostic indicators, and management of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are still unclear because of its infrequent occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case series presents the surgical experience of the authors' center over 29 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of children treated for ACTs between 1974 and 2003 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on age, sex, presenting symptoms, hormonal levels, pathology, stage, treatment, and outcome was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine children (5 girls, 4 boys) were treated for ACTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age at presentation was 29 months (range, 5 months to 11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">Endocrine</z:chebi> dysfunction was found in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four presented with virilizing symptoms, 4 presented with both virilizing and Cushing's symptoms, and 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> was identified during routine screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One was an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, and 8 were <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, 3 were stage I, and 5 were stage II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> weight was 125 g (range, 42 g to 336 g) with a mean volume of 139 cm3 (range, 30 cm3 to 626 cm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had complete excision of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with spillage occurring in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lymph node biopsies were done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients were treated with chemotherapy because of large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size and nodal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients are doing well including those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spillage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that surgical excision continues to be the mainstay of treatment for ACTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Extensive lymph node biopsy in small ACTs can probably be avoided given the generally good outcome with surgery alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The role of adjuvant chemotherapy remains unclear because most of the children in our series were effectively treated with surgical resection only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Patients should be enrolled in multicenter trials to assess the added value of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
