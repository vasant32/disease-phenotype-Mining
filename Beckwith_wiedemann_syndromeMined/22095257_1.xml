<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A partial glossectomy was performed in 4 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith- Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> between the ages of 0.5 and 3.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An ENT assessment, a phonetic inventory, a phonemic and phonological analysis and a consensus perceptual evaluation of speech intelligibility, resonance and oromyofunctional behavior were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was not possible in this study to separate the effects of the surgery from the typical developmental progress of speech sound mastery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Improved speech intelligibility, a more complete phonetic inventory, an increase in phonological skills, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resonance and increased motor-oriented oral behavior were found in the postsurgical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of phonetic distortions, lip incompetence and interdental tongue position were still present in the postsurgical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460,C0699719,C0037831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Finding" abbrv="">Speech therapy</z:e> should be focused on correct phonetic placement and a motor-oriented approach to increase lip competence, and on functional tongue exercises and tongue lifting during the production of alveolars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detailed analyses in a larger number of subjects with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> may help further illustrate the long-term impact of partial glossectomy </plain></SENT>
