<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> neonatally and gradually developed coarse facial changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001537'>umbilical hernia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Renal sonography done after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> developed showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000105'>large kidneys</z:hpo> in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The placentas were carefully examined in both cases but findings described as typical of WBS were only found in one </plain></SENT>
