<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The observation of constitutional chromosome abnormalities in a one and half year old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS)</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> prompted us to review the currently available literature dealing with this subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In approximately 500 published cases with complete and incomplete forms of WBS, 42 malignant and 9 benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>Malignant tumors</z:mp>, in particular, mainly consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006744'>adrenocortical carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient presented in this paper is the fourth with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The constitutional karyotype was analysed in 84 cases; in 68 of them with banding techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities have only been detected in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 47;XXY karyotype, an inversion of chromosome 2, a partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 8 and reciprocal translocations t(11;22) and t(X;1), respectively, have been observed in one case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individually differing changes in the remaining six cases led to a common triplication of the region 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This triplication has also been the only abnormality, which has so far been reported in one out of six investigated WBS patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis in our case revealed an interstitial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 11 and a complete pericentric inversion of the chromosome 9 heterochromatin block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints of the deletion, del(11) (p11.1p11.2), are located proximal of those (11p15) reported in anomalies of other WBS patients, as well as proximal of those involved in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilm's tumor</z:hpo> complex (11p13-11p14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inversion of the heterochromatin of chromosome 9 has been recognized as a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variant, which generally remains without phenotypic effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
