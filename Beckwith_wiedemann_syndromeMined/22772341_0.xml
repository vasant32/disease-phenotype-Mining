<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Placental mesenchymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (PMD) is a rare condition which is associated with the disparate fetal outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), fetal growth restriction or intrauterine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the potential epigenetic/genetic anomalies associated with PMD and their relationship with the different causes of BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight archival cases in which PMD, BWS or both were diagnosed were investigated by correlating <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with p57 Kip2 expression, XY fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis and DNA genotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Placentae from BWS cases caused by aberrant IC2 methylation, leading to abnormal p57 Kip2 expression, did not show PMD but had a striking excess of extravillous trophoblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PMD in the absence of BWS was caused by androgenetic/biparental mosaicism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The single case of BWS with PMD was due to mosaic <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the latter two aetiologies, our results indicate that the <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> is confined to the villous mesenchyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the link between PMD and BWS is <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of genes confined to the telomeric IC1 region of 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A strong candidate gene is IGF2, a known growth factor of placental mesenchyme </plain></SENT>
