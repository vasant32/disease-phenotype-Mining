<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These advances have further delineated intricate (epi)genetic regulation of the imprinted gene cluster on chromosome 11p15.5 and the role of these genes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies of the molecular changes associated with the BWS phenotype have been instrumental in elucidating critical molecular elements in this imprinted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review will provide updated information on the multiple new regulatory elements that have been recently found to contribute to in cis or in trans control of imprinted gene expression in the chromosome 11p15.5 region and the clinical expression of the BWS phenotype.
