<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000825'>Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurs in about 50% of children with BWS and, in the majority of infants, it resolves spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in a small group of patients the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> can be persistent and may require pancreatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000825'>hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in this group of patients is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using patch-clamp techniques on pancreatic tissue obtained at the time of surgery, we investigated the electrophysiological properties of ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channels in pancreatic beta-cells in a patient with BWS and severe medically-unresponsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000825'>hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> was found to be caused by abnormalities in K(ATP) channels of the pancreatic beta-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence studies using a SUR1 antibody revealed perinuclear pattern of staining in the BWS cells, suggesting a trafficking defect of the SUR1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found in the genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11 encoding for the two subunits, SUR1 and KIR6.2, respectively, of the K(ATP) channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of this patients BWS showed evidence of mosaic paternal isodisomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this novel case of BWS with mosaic paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> for 11p15, persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> was due to abnormalities in K(ATP) channels of the pancreatic beta-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism/s by which mosaic paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> for 11p15 causes a trafficking defect in the SUR1 protein of the K(ATP) channel remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
