<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This syndrome consists of various abnormalities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003271'>visceromegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gigantism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities frequently require operative correction during the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
