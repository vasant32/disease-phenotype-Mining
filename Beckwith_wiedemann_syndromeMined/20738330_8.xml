<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known congenital imprinting disorders an association with aberrant methylation or mutations at specific loci was well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, several patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008255'>transient neonatal diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (TNDM), Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) exhibiting multilocus hypomethylation (MLH) have meanwhile been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas TNDM patients with MLH show clinical symptoms different from carriers with isolated 6q24 aberrations, MLH carriers diagnosed as BWS or SRS present only the syndrome-specific features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, SRS and BWS patients with nearly identical MLH patterns in leukocytes have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We now report on the molecular findings in DNA in three SRS patients with hypomethylation of both 11p15 imprinted control regions (ICRs) in leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient was a monozygotic (MZ) twin, another was a triplet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the hypomethylation affected both oppositely imprinted 11p15 ICRs in leukocytes, in buccal swab DNA only the ICR1 hypomethylation was visible in two of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the non-affected MZ twin of one of these patients, aberrant methylation was also present in leukocytes but neither in buccal swab DNA nor in skin fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite mutation screening of several factors involved in establishment and maintenance of methylation marks including ZFP57, MBD3, DNMT1 and DNMT3L the molecular clue for the ICR1/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> hypomethylation in our patients remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the reason for the development of the specific SRS phenotype is not obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data reflect the broad range of epimutations in SRS and illustrate that an extensive molecular and clinical characterization of patients is necessary </plain></SENT>
