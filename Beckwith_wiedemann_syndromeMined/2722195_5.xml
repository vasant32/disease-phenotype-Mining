<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to map the genes involved more precisely, we have fused a mouse cell line with cell lines from patients with constitutional deletions or translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characterization of somatic cell hybrids with 11p-specific DNA markers has allowed us to subdivide the short arm into 11 subregions, 7 of which belong to band 11p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have thus defined the smallest region of overlap for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> locus bracketed by the closest proximal and distal breakpoints in two of these hybrids </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These hybrids also represent useful tools for mapping new markers to this region of the human genome </plain></SENT>
