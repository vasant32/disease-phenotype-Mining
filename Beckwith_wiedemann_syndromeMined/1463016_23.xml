<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) gene codes for the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, it would be advantageous to identify a polymorphism in this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By examining introns of the human TPH gene by PCR amplification and analysis by the single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) technique, an SSCP was revealed with two alleles that occur with frequencies of .40 and .60 in unrelated Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNAs from 24 informative CEPH families were typed for the TPH intron polymorphism and analyzed with respect to 10 linked markers on chromosome 11, between p13 and p15, with the result that TPH was placed between D11S151 and D11S134 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This region contains loci for several important genes, including those for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and tyrosine hydroxylase </plain></SENT>
