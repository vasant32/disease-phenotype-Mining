<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific primers designed from the 3' end of human TnTf cDNA were used to amplify an intronic region by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This TnTf-specific PCR product was detected from two somatic cell hybrids containing human chromosomes 9 and 11, respectively, in NIGMS mapping panel 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, further studies with other somatic hybrid cell lines (Bios Laboratory) localized the TnTf gene (HGMW-approved symbol TNNT3) only to chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This observation was further confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization with a 12-kb TnTf genomic probe generated by extended PCR, showing the sublocalization of the gene to band p15.5 on chromosome 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This locus is of specific interest, as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> and various childhood and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related abnormalities have been mapped to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study also indicates the presence of an 11pter region in the NIGMS cell hybrid GM10611, which has previously been reported to contain only human chromosome 9 </plain></SENT>
