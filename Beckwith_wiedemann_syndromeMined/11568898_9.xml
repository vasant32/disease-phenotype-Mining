<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We undertook a cost-benefit analysis of screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), a known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> predisposition syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this analysis was twofold: first, to assess whether screening in children with BWS has the potential to be cost-effective; second, if screening appears to be cost-effective, to determine which parameters would be most important to assess if a screening trial were initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: We used data from the BWS registry at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute, the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms Tumor</z:hpo> Study (NWTS), and large published series to model events for two hypothetical cohorts of 1,000 infants born with BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hypothetical cohort was screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> until a predetermined age, representing the base case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other cohort was unscreened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For our base case, we assumed: (a) sonography examinations three times yearly (triannually) from birth until 7 years of age; (b) screening would result in one stage shift downward at diagnosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo>; (c) 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity for detecting clinical stage I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo>; (d) a 3% discount rate; (e) a false positive result cost of $402 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We estimated mortality rates based on published <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> stage specific survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using the base case, screening a child with BWS from birth until 4 years of age results in a cost per life year saved of $9,642 while continuing until 7 years of age results in a cost per life-year saved of $14,740 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When variables such as cost of screening examination, discount rate, and effectiveness of screening were varied based on high and low estimates, the incremental cost per life-year saved for screening up until age four remained comparable to acceptable population based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening ranges (&lt; $50,000 per life year saved) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Under our model's assumptions, abdominal sonography examinations in children with BWS represent a reasonable strategy for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening trial is warranted to determine if, when, and how often children with BWS should be screened and to determine cost-effectiveness in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
