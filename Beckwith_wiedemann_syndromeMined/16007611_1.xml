<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of cases of BWS are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, but a substantial proportion are familial, with an unknown <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> and sex-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that in familial BWS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> is the primary mode of transmission underlying familial instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Segregation analysis was performed in 291 families ascertained with an affected child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals were considered to have BWS if they had two of five major features: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> at birth, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010866'>abdominal wall defect</z:hpo>, and ear pits or creases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> were tested using pedigree analysis package (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) parameterized for a discrete trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 291 families of an affected proband were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analysis was based on a revised general model that included a boundary solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> and environmental models were rejected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the results suggested Mendelian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> but under recessive or additive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>, which fit the data equally well rather than dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of families in the cohort consistent with dominant and sex-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> suggest familial BWS may be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group comprised of different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Familial BWS does not appear to be consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> transmission, and is likely a complex mixture of different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> patterns </plain></SENT>
