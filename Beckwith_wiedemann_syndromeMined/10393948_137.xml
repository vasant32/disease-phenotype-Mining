<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Imprinting control elements are proposed to exist within the KvLQT1 locus, because multiple BWS-associated chromosome rearrangements disrupt this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified an evolutionarily conserved, maternally methylated CpG island (KvDMR1) in an intron of the KvLQT1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 12 cases of BWS with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> H19 methylation, 5 showed demethylation of KvDMR1 in fibroblast or lymphocyte DNA; whereas, in 4 cases of BWS with H19 hypermethylation, methylation at KvDMRl was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, inactivation of H19 and hypomethylation at KvDMR1 (or an associated phenomenon) represent distinct epigenetic anomalies associated with biallelic expression of IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of the human and syntenic mouse loci identified the presence of a KvDMR1-associated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcribed exclusively from the paternal allele and in the opposite orientation with respect to the maternally expressed KvLQT1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that KvDMR1 and/or its associated antisense <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (KvLQT1-AS) represents an additional imprinting control element or center in the human 11p15.5 and mouse distal 7 imprinted domains </plain></SENT>
