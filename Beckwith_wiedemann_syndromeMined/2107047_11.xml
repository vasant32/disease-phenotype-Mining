<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>Neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> (NF) was the diagnosis of 118 of them; 42 had other phakomatoses and 10 had transitional phenotypes difficult to classify </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartomas</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> probands indicated disorganized differentiation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of cell species characteristic for the involved tissue and location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abundance of extracellular fibrillary components was also evident in most <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adequate blood supply was a conditio sine qua non </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was seen in monogenic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, transitional and combined phakomatoses alike and implied a common pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The paracrine growth factors and their regulation emerged as the most plausible common denominator for the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A unitary pathogenetic hypothesis is proposed that the phakomatoses represent paracrine growth regulation disorders (paracrinopathies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016048" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">fibromatoses</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lipomatoses</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophies</z:hpo>, hemihyper/hypotrophies, including Russell-Silver and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e> may be proven to be paracrinopathies as well </plain></SENT>
