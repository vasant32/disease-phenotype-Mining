<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) is a model imprinting disorder resulting from mutations or epigenetic events involving imprinted genes at chromosome 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, germline mutations in CDKN1C, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD), and loss of imprinting of IGF2 and other imprinted genes have been implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many familial BWS cases have germline CDKN1C mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, most BWS cases are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and UPD or putative imprinting errors predominate in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have identified previously a subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases with loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF2 and epigenetic silencing of H19 proposed to be caused by a defect in a distal 11p15.5 imprinting control element (designated BWSIC1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, many <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS patients show biallelic IGF2 expression in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> H19 methylation and expression patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This and other evidence suggested the existence of a further imprinting control element (BWSIC2) at 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recently, we showed that a subgroup of BWS patients have loss of methylation (LOM) at a differentially methylated region (KvDMR1) within the KCNQ1 gene centromeric to the IGF2 and H19 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have now analysed a large series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases to define the frequency and phenotypic correlates of epigenetic abnormalities in BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LOM at KvDMR1 was detected by Southern analysis or a novel PCR based method in 35 of 69 (51%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BWS without UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LOM at KvDMR1 was often, but not invariably associated with LOI of IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>KvDMR1 LOM was not detected in BWS patients with putative BWSIC1 defects and cases with KvDMR1 LOM (that is, putative BWSIC2 defects) invariably had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> H19 methylation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp> in putative BWSIC2 defect patients was not significantly different from that in patients with germline CDKN1C mutations (20/29 and 13/15 respectively), but was significantly greater than that in patients with putative BWSIC1 defects (0/5, p=0.007) and UPD (0/22, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that LOM of KvDMR1 (BWSIC2 defect) results in epigenetic silencing of CDKN1C and variable LOI of IGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>BWS patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">embryonal tumours</z:e> have UPD or a BWSIC1 defect but not LOM of KvDMR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This study has further shown how (1) variations in phenotypic expression of BWS may be linked to specific molecular subgroups and (2) molecular analysis of BWS can provide insights into mechanisms of imprinting regulation </plain></SENT>
