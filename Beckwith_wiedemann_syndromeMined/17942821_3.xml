<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Activating mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes encoding the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel are the most common cause of permanent neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to KCNJ11, where only dominant heterozygous mutations have been identified, recessively acting ABCC8 mutations have recently been found in some patients with neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These genes are co-located on chromosome 11p15.1, centromeric to the imprinted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) locus at 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated a male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo>, a condition classically associated with neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, who developed neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at age 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes and microsatellite markers on chromosome 11 were analyzed in DNA samples from the patient and his parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A paternally inherited activating mutation (N72S) in the ABCC8 gene was identified in the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation was present at 70% in the patient's leukocytes and 50% in buccal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite analysis demonstrated mosaic segmental paternal uniparental isodisomy (UPD) of 11pter-11p14 in the proband that encompassed the ABCC8 gene and the BWS locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report a patient with neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo>, and relatively high birth weight resulting from telomeric segmental paternal UPD of chromosome 11, which unmasks a recessively acting gain-of-function mutation in the ABCC8 gene and causes deregulation of imprinted genes at the BWS locus on 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
