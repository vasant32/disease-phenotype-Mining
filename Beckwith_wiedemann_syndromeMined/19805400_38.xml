<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, increased frequencies of imprinting disorders have been correlated with ARTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significantly, for Angelman and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndromes</z:e>, patients have been identified where ovarian stimulation was the only procedure used by the couple undergoing ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In many cases, increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> disorders has been attributed to superovulation in combination with inherent <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertility</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To distinguish between these contributing factors, carefully controlled experiments are required on spontaneously ovulated, in vivo-fertilized oocytes and their induced-ovulated counterparts, thereby minimizing effects of in vitro manipulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To this end, effects of superovulation on <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> were evaluated in a mouse model, where <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertility</z:mp> is not a confounding issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This work represents the first comprehensive examination of the overall effects of superovulation on imprinted DNA methylation for four imprinted genes in individual blastocyst stage embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that superovulation perturbed <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> of both maternally and paternally expressed genes; loss of Snrpn, Peg3 and Kcnq1ot1 and gain of H19 imprinted methylation were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This perturbation was dose-dependent, with aberrant imprinted methylation more frequent at the high hormone dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Superovulation is thought to primarily affect oocyte development; thus, effects were expected to be limited to maternal alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed that maternal as well as paternal H19 methylation was perturbed by superovulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We postulate that superovulation has dual effects during oogenesis, disrupting acquisition of imprints in growing oocytes, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0003718'>maternal-effect</z:mp> gene products subsequently required for imprint maintenance during pre-implantation development </plain></SENT>
