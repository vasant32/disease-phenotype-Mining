<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Children with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), a congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndrome characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0003052'>exomphalos</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, have an increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumors</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>, and RMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although an association between RMS and the BWS is well accepted, only four cases have been reported to date, and of these, three were reported as embryonal RMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, an association between BWS and embryonal RMS has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report three additional cases of BWS with RMS and review the clinical data for each patient as well as the pathology of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three cases of BWS had histology consistent with alveolar RMS and were diagnosed at 6 weeks and 5 and 13 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two of these BWS cases, constitutional defects of 11p15 imprinting were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cytogenetic analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> did not detect the t(2;13) or t(1;13) translocations that generate the PAX3- or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins common to alveolar RMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the development of alveolar RMS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in BWS may occur without the chromosomal rearrangement producing the PAX-FKHR fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, we present three new cases of RMS demonstrating a new association between BWS and an uncommon subtype of alveolar RMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The absence of the translocations commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006779'>alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> suggests a common 11p15 pathway for alveolar RMS and BWS </plain></SENT>
