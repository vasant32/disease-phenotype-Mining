<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proposita had classical stigmata of BWS including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo>, and typical ear creases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes were 46,XX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both parents and the extended maternal family were clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
