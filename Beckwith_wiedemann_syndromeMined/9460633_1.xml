<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We evaluated the outcome of fetuses with prenatally diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>undescended testes</z:hpo> at 35 weeks or more of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified the fetuses in our database in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>undescended testes</z:hpo> were identified sonographically in the last month of pregnancy and for whom outcome information could be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associated sonographic abnormalities were tabulated from the original reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were obtained through reviews of the pediatric medical records and pathology reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six fetuses in 5 patients (1 had twins) were identified as having an empty scrotum at 35 weeks or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 fetuses, this finding was the only prenatal sonographic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these fetuses had isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>undescended testes</z:hpo> at birth; the twins were found at birth to be females with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008258'>congenital adrenal hyperplasia</z:hpo> and severe masculinization of the genitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 3 fetuses had other malformations seen prenatally, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001539'>omphalocele</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>), a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0000776'>diaphragmatic hernia</z:hpo>, and multiple congenital abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>undescended testes</z:hpo> in late gestation may be noted in an otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetus, it may also be associated with a potential risk for perinatal problems ranging from severe multiple congenital abnormalities to incorrect sex assignment due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559218" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">masculinization of female</z:e> genitalia </plain></SENT>
