<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>Genomic imprinting</z:mp> is an epigenetic process in which allele-specific gene expression is dependent on the parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although only a minority of human genes are imprinted, those that have been identified to date have been preferentially implicated in prenatal growth and neurodevelopment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations or epimutations in imprinted genes or imprinting control centres are associated with imprinting disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, an increased frequency of assisted reproductive technology (ART) conceptions has been reported in children with BWS and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of imprinting disorders in ART children is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook a survey of 2492 children born after ART in the Republic of Ireland and Central England with the aim of detecting cases (both clinically diagnosed and previously unrecognized) of BWS and AS in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response rate to an initial questionnaire was 61%, corresponding to data for 1524 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After evaluation of the questionnaire, 70 children were invited for a detailed clinical assessment, and 47 accepted (response rate of 67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this entire cohort, we detected one case of BWS and no cases of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did not find evidence that there exists a significant group of ART children with unrecognized milder forms of AS or BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although previous studies have suggested an increased relative risk of BWS and AS after ART, our findings suggest that the absolute risk of imprinting disorders in children conceived by ART is small (&lt;1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Precise risk estimates of risk are difficult to define because of the rarity of the conditions and incomplete response rates to the questionnaire and clinical examination invitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hence further investigations are indicated to (i) refine the absolute and relative risks of imprinting disorders after ART and (ii) ensure that changes in ART protocols are not associated with increased frequencies of epigenetic changes and imprinting disorders in children born after ART </plain></SENT>
