<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This manifestation was part of a broader phenotype, which was recognized as a mild form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis confirmed the diagnosis of BWS owing to a maternally inherited deletion of the centromeric imprinting center, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e>, an extremely rare genetic mechanism in BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The deletion interval (198â€‰kb) also included exons 11-16 of the KCNQ1 gene, known to be responsible for LQTS at locus LQT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No concomitant mutations were found in any other of the known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposita's mother carries the same deletion in her paternal chromosome and shows manifestations of the Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report describes the smallest BWS-causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> deletion and provides the first evidence that a paternal deletion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICR2</z:e> leads to a SRS-like phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, our observation strongly suggests that in cases of LQTS due to mutation of the KCNQ1 gene (LQT1), an accurate clinical genetic evaluation should be done in order to program the most appropriate genetic tests.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 20 March 2013; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2012.280 </plain></SENT>
