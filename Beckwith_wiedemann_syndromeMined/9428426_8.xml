<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mouse chimeras made with androgenetic (two paternal genomes) ova or embryonic stem cells frequently die at the perinatal stage and exhibit a range of defects, the most noticeable being a pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of rib cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Excess concentrations of IGFII, a potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>, has been suggested to play a major role in these defects, as androgenetic cells possess two active paternal copies of the imprinted Igf2 gene, rather than one inactive maternal and one active paternal copy as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that chimeras made with androgenetic embryonic stem cells, homozygous for an Igf2 null mutation, do not develop rib cartilage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, demonstrating the dependence of this defect on Igf2 activity produced by androgenetic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in these same chimeras, many other defects, including whole body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, are still prevalent, indicating that the abnormal expression of one or more imprinted genes, other than Igf2, is also capable of inducing most of the defects of androgenetic chimeras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many of these genes may reside on distal chromosome 7, as we also show that perinatal chimeras made with embryonic stem cells possessing paternal duplication of distal chromosome 7 exhibit a range of defects similar to those of androgenetic chimeras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relevance of these findings for the human imprinting-related disorder, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, is discussed </plain></SENT>
