<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HB is associated with inherited conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, suggesting the importance of genetic abnormalities in the pathogenesis and progression of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has a very polymorphous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A diverse range of cytogenetic alterations has been reported to date, the most frequent being <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 2 and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five HB specimens from 31 patients (22 purely epithelial, 4 purely mesenchymal, 9 mixed) were examined by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), a technique that enables us to screen the entire <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> genome for genetic losses and gains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our aims were as follows: (1) to characterize chromosome abnormalities that appear in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and (2) to identify possible differences between different histologic subtypes of HB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found significant gains of genetic material, with very little difference in the number and type of alterations between the different histologic components of HB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent alterations were gains of Xp (15 cases, 43%) and Xq (21 cases, 60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding was also confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization performed on nuclei extracted from 6 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other common alterations were 1p-, 2q+, 2q-, 4q-, and 4q+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found no difference between different histologic subtypes, a finding that may be in agreement with the hypothesis of a common clonal origin for the different components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An hitherto-unreported high frequency of X chromosome gains may support the assumption that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> genes are involved in the development of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
