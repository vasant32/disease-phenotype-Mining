<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The most frequent epigenetic alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> (WT) occur at WT2, assigned to 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>WT2 consists of two domains: telomeric domain 1 (DMRH19) that contains the IGF2 gene and an imprinted maternally expressed transcript (H19) and centromeric domain 2 (KvDMR) that contains the genes KCNQ1, KCNQ1OT1 and CDKN1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we used pyrosequencing and MS-MLPA to compare the methylation patterns of DMRH19/KvDMR in blood and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples from 40 WT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> constitutional KvDMR methylation indicated that most of the epigenetic alterations in WT occur at DMRH19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Constitutional DMRH19 hypermethylation (HM DMRH19) was observed in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pyrosequencing and MS-MLPA showed HM DMRH19 in 28/34 tumor samples: 16/34 with isolated HM DMRH19 and 12/34 with concomitant HM DMRH19 and KvDMR hypomethylation, indicating paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the exception of one blood sample, the MS-MLPA and pyrosequencing findings were concordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffuse or focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">anaplasia</z:e> was present in five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples and was associated with isolated somatic HM DMRH19 in four of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Constitutional 11p15 methylation abnormalities were present in 5% of the samples and somatic abnormalities in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined analysis of DMRH19/KvDMR by pyrosequencing and MS-MLPA is beneficial for characterizing epigenetic anomalies in WT, and MS-MLPA is useful and reliable for estimation of DNA methylation in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
