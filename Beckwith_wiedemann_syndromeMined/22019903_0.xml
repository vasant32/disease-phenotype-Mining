<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the components of this system (IGFs, receptors, and binding proteins) are expressed in human fetal adrenals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, a congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> disorder characterized by a high risk of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumors</z:e>, is also distinguished by a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006744'>adrenocortical carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This disease has been associated with structural abnormalities at the 11p15 locus, which harbors the IGF2 gene as well as the genes coding for insulin, H19, and p57kip2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, rearrangements at the 11p15 locus and overexpression of IGF2 were also described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001618" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adrenocortical tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the IGF2 overexpression was exclusively demonstrated in adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001618" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adrenocortical tumors</z:e> as a frequent feature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0599849" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More recent studies demonstrated that the interaction of IGF-2 with IGF receptor type 1 (IGF-1R) plays also a pivotal role in adrenocortical <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IGF1R expression levels were significantly higher in pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0006744'>adrenocortical carcinomas</z:hpo>, suggesting that IGF1R expression represents a potential prognostic marker in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the IGF system is an important pathway for autonomous growth of adrenocortical cells and potential inhibitors of this system could be a rational therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001618" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adrenocortical tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
