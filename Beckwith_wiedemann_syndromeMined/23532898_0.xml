<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a patient with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> pediatric bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytomas</z:hpo> caused by mosaic chromosome 11p15 paternal uniparental isodisomy (UPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemihyperplasia of the arm was diagnosed in a 4-month-old female and clinical methylation testing for 11p15 in the blood was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, with a reported detection threshold for mosaicism of 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was subsequently diagnosed at 18 months with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> tissue demonstrated mosaic deletions of 8p12pter, 21q21.1qter, 22q11.23qter; commonly seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, mosaic 11p15.3pter homozygosity was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular testing for other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytomas</z:hpo> was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, suggesting that 11p15 homozygosity was the primary event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent SNP array analysis of skin fibroblasts from the hyperplastic side demonstrated 5% mosaic paternal UPD for 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have subsequently used SNP array analysis to identify four patients with subtle hemihyperplasia with low-level mosaic UPD that was not detected by methylation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the increased sensitivity of SNP array analysis to detect UPD along with the increased incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in these UPD patients, we suggest that it has high utility in the clinical work-up of hemihyperplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present case also suggests that 11p15 paternal UPD may be an under-detected mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a review of the literature suggests that patients with 11p15 paternal UPD may present after 8 years of age with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> and raises the possibility that ultrasound screening could be considered beyond 8 years of age in this subset of hemihyperplasia and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> patients.
