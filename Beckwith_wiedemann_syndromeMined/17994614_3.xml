<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present a case report in which several molecular analyses of amniocytes and products of conception were used in combination with cytogenetic and ultrasound studies to evaluate a pregnancy with a clinical suspicion of PMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A combination of Southern blotting analysis, methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was utilized to evaluate methylation patterns in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) and Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (PW/AS) critical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A series of microsatellite markers were used to evaluate the possibility of an androgenetic cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Methylation studies performed for the BWS and PW/AS critical regions were abnormal and consistent with a molecular diagnosis of BWS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies of amniocytes using microsatellite markers identified androgenetic and biparental cell lines in approximately a 10:1 ratio, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal ultrasonography, karyotyping and molecular genetic evaluation for BWS alone were not sufficient to identify the underlying etiology of PMD in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The androgenetic cell line was only identified after microsatellite analysis </plain></SENT>
