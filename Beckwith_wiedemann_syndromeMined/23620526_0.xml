<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disruption of methylation patterns at imprinted loci resulting in loss of imprinting (LOI) may lead to serious imprinting disorders (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>) and is described in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As most research has focused on children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or other abnormal phenotypes, the imprinting status in healthy infants at birth has not been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the prevalence of H19 and IGF2 LOI at birth by allele-specific expression assays analysis on 114 human individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall expression and methylation analyses were performed on a subset of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that LOI of H19 was observed for 4% of individuals in cord blood and 3.3% in placenta, and for IGF2 of 22% of individuals in the cord blood and 0% in placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, LOI status did not correspond to aberrant methylation levels of the imprinted DMRs or with changes in overall gene expression for the majority of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that LOI is present in phenotypically healthy infants </plain></SENT>
