<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we present an extensive case study of a monozygotic monochorionic male twin pair discordant for BWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our analysis allows to correlate BWS symptoms, like a <z:hpo ids='HP_0010808'>protruding tongue</z:hpo>, indented ears and transient neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, to an abnormal methylation at the KvDMR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNAs extracted from peripheral blood, skin fibroblasts, saliva and buccal swab of both twins, their sister and parents were analysed at 11 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four relevant DMRs of the BWS region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The KvDMR1 was exclusively found to be hypomethylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell types of the affected BWS twin, while the unaffected twin and the relatives showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation in fibroblasts, buccal swab and saliva DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the twins share a common blood-specific hypomethylation phenotype most probably caused by a feto-fetal transfusion between both twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because microsatellite analysis furthermore revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biparental karyotype for chromosome 11, our results point to an exclusive correlation of the observed BWS symptoms to locally restricted epimutations at the KvDMR1 of the maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
