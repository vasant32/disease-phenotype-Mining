<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although both disorders are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, most cases of BWS and SRS are associated with opposite epigenetic or genetic abnormalities on 11p15.5 leading to opposite imbalances in the expression levels of imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article we review evidence implicating these genes in the developmental regulation of embryonic growth and placental function in mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The emerging picture suggests that both SRS and BWS can be caused by the simultaneous and opposite deregulation of two groups of imprinted genes on 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A detailed description of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo> associated with each syndrome must take into consideration the developmental functions of each gene involved </plain></SENT>
