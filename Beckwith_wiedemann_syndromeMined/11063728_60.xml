<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between human and mouse will help in elucidating these mechanisms by identifying structural and functional similarities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously we reported on such a comparison in the central part of the mouse imprinting cluster on distal chromosome 7 with the homologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) gene cluster on human chromosome 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we focus on the adjacent sequences of 0.5 Mb including the KCNQ1/Kcnq1 and CDKN1C/Cdkn1c genes, which are implicated in BWS, and on one of the proposed boundary regions of the imprinting cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As in the previously analysed central region, this part of the cluster exhibits a highly conserved arrangement and structure of genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most striking similarity is found in the 3' part of the KCNQ1/Kcnq1 genes in large stretches of mostly non-coding sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conserved region includes the recently identified KCNQ1OT1/Kcnq1ot1 antisense transcripts, flanked by a strikingly conserved cluster of LINE/Line elements and a CpG island which we show to carry a maternal germline methylation imprint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This region is likely to be the proposed second imprinting centre (IC2) in the BWS cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also identified several novel genes inside and outside the previously proposed boundaries of the imprinting cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the genes outside the cluster, Obph1, is imprinted in mouse placenta indicating that at least in extra-embryonic tissues the imprinting cluster extends into a larger domain </plain></SENT>
