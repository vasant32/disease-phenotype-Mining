<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since rare patients show varying karyotypic abnormalities on the short arm of chromosome 11, it has been suggested that BWS may be related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> gene on 11p13 or, alternatively, to growth factor genes on 11p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed genetic linkage analysis on two BWS kindreds, using RFLPs for loci on 11p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BWS was linked to the insulin gene (11p15.5), with an overall maximum lod score of 3.60 (recombination fraction = .00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage to D11S16 (11p13) could be excluded for recombination fractions less than or equal to .03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that BWS defines a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-predisposition gene on 11p15 </plain></SENT>
