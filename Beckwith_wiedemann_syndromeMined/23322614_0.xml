<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The constitutional karyotype was apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but FISH analysis with probes specific for the short and long arms of chromosome 11 found 11qter deletion with 11pter <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> in 80% of the cells studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Array-CGH identified breakpoints in the 11p15.3 and 11q24.1 regions consistent with Jacobsen and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this chromosome imbalance results from a pericentric inversion of chromosome 11 inherited from the father, with mosaicism resulting from meiotic recombination of a paternal inversion followed by mitotic recombination during the first embryonic divisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is supported by the results of microsatellite marker analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three previous cases of pericentric inversion and recombination of chromosome 11 have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our case is unusual in that it combines the Jacobsen and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes</z:e> with mosaicism </plain></SENT>
