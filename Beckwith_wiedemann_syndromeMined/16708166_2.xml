<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromosome studies including array comparative genomic hybridization showed that she was the carrier of an unbalanced de novo translocation between the X chromosome and chromosome 11, resulting in partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> Xq and partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 11p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite analysis demonstrated that the patient had paternal duplication of 11p13p15.5, which contributed to some of her features consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) </plain></SENT>
