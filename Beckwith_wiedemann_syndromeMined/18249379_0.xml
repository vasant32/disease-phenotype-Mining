<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The E-Q-PCR test can detect and quantify the methylation changes between BWS fetuses and unaffected individuals in aminocytes as well as in lymphocytes and can be completed in 1 working day, and thus is a useful method for prenatal molecular diagnosis of BWS </plain></SENT>
