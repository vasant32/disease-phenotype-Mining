Patients with Apert syndrome inevitably have ocular problems. These include proptosis, strabismus, amblyopia, optic atrophy, and occasionally papilledema. Visual loss or blindness is a real possibility and can be avoided. Craniofacial surgery, while alleviating proptosis, may cause an alteration in strabismus, visual loss, and tearing problems. These children should always be assessed and followed by an ophthalmologist as part of the craniofacial team.
