The purpose of this study was to assess long-term position of the maxilla after surgical Le Fort III advancement of midfacial structures in patients with craniosynostosis syndromes. Data from preoperative, short and long-term postoperative lateral head films on 21 consecutive patients with Crouzon's syndrome, Pfeiffer's syndrome, or Apert's syndrome were analyzed. A method of evaluating the position of the postoperative maxilla on lateral head films is described. On average, the position of the maxilla did not change significantly in the postoperative periods studied, although some individual variation was demonstrated. Postoperative management, utilizing a registration bite splint after the intermaxillary fixation has been removed, similar to our treatment following bone grafting procedures in patients with hemifacial microsomia, is described.
