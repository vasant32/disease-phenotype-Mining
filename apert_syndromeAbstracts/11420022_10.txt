OBJECTIVE: Distraction osteogenesis is a well-accepted technique in the treatment of patients with hypoplastic craniofacial components. Complications of distraction osteogenesis are well described in the literature. We describe a complication of using an external distraction device in a 9-year-old girl with Pfeiffer. INTERVENTION AND RESULTS: A modified Lefort III osteotomy was performed for maxillary hypoplasia with application of an external distraction halo device by a pediatric neurosurgeon. A postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan showed 0.5-cm skull penetration of the cranial pins. The pins were repositioned and the patient was followed up on a regular basis until discharge from the hospital. At 3-week follow-up, a CT scan of the head showed migration of the pins 1.5 cm intracranially. The halo was removed and repositioned at a different site. No detectable neurological sequelae from the pin penetration were noted. The patient developed cellulitis at the site of the penetration and was admitted to the hospital for a course of intravenous antibiotics. There were no other complications, and the rest of her treatment course proceeded as planned. A review of the literature on complications of halo usage as well as suggestions for their management in association with distraction osteogenesis is described.
