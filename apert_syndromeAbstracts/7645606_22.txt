We studied 44 pairs of hands and 37 pairs of feet in Apert syndrome, utilizing clinical, dermatoglyphic, and radiographic methods. We also studied histologic sections of the hand from a 31-week stillborn fetus. Topic headings discussed include: clinical classification of syndactyly; correlations between types of hands and feet in the same patient; dermatoglyphics; anatomy of the hand; radiologic assessment; comparison with other studies; histologic assessment of the hand; acrocephalosyndactyly vs. acrocephalopolysyndactyly: a pseudodistinction; and some generalizations.
