The verbal communication skills of six children with craniofacial syndromes were examined. The subjects were four girls with Apert syndrome, a boy with Crouzon disease, and a fifth girl with Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome. They ranged in age from six to sixteen years. Each of the six subjects demonstrated oral structural anomalies and at least a mild communication problem. Sample size precluded the formation of judgments relative to the population as a whole or to particular subgroups.
