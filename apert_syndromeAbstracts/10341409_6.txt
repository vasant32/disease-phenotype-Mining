Apert syndrome is characterized by craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia and bilateral syndactyly. We document in detail the intrauterine natural history of Apert syndrome by serial sonographic examination. Ultrasound examination of a 19-week fetus revealed an abnormal appearance of the skull. The subsequent examination including transvaginal brain scanning demonstrated a deformed occipital part of the cerebrum and lateral ventricles, frontal bossing, a low nasal bridge and an abnormal appearance of the fetal hands and feet. The distortion of the fetal profile became progressively worse with advancing gestation. Towards the end of pregnancy, anterior prominence of the cerebrum, ventricles and corpus callosum was demonstrated and mild non-progressive ventriculomegaly was seen. The female 3152-g newborn with the typical facial appearance of Apert syndrome, bilateral syndactyly of the fingers and toes and isolated cleft palate was delivered at 37 weeks. Postnatal three-dimensional computed tomography scan demonstrated the fusion of the coronal suture and a wide mid-line calvarial defect, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the prenatal sonographic findings. Although the karyotype was normal, genomic DNA analysis of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 revealed Ser252Trp, which is specified in the mutational basis of Apert syndrome. The time course of the prenatal findings in this case may help increase understanding of the intrauterine natural history of Apert syndrome.
