The Museum Vrolik collection of the Department of Anatomy and Embryology of the University of Amsterdam, founded by Gerardus Vrolik (1775-1859) and his son Willem Vrolik (1801-1863), consists of more than 5,000 thousand specimens of human and animal anatomy, embryology, pathology, and congenital anomalies. Recently, the collection of congenital anomalies was recatalogued and redescribed according to contempory syndromological views. The original descriptions, as far as preserved, were compared with the clinical and radiographical findings. In 13 specimens the following multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) syndromes were diagnosed: acrofacial dysostosis, Apert syndrome, Brachmann-De Lange syndrome, ichthyosis congenita gravis, Jarcho-Levin syndrome, Meckel syndrome, oro-facio-digital syndrome type IV, Roberts syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and trisomy 13. It appeared that the founders of the museum studied and described several of these syndromes many years before they became established as such. In some specimens a reliable diagnosis is still pending. The use of additional diagnostical techniques, such as MRI, CT scanning, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, in these specimens is currently being investigated.
