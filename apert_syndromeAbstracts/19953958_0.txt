 OBJECTIVE: To discuss the early surgical treament of fronto-orbital retrusion in craniosynostosis. METHODS: Operative techniques including "C" fronto-orbital osteotomies and advancement, frontal radially oriented osteotomies and remoulding were performed to correct the fronto-orbital retrusion. Ten patients aged from 6-9 monthes were included. There were two metopic synostosis, three unilateral coronal synostosis, three bilateral coronal synostosis, one Apert syndromic synostosis and one Crouzon syndromic synostosis. RESULTS: Fronto-orbital deformities of all patients were corrected. There were no complications happened in these patients. The post-operation results were kept well for 3-11 months follow-up in 8 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Fronto-orbital osteotomies and advancement and frontal reshaping were effective to correct fronto-orbital retrusion in craniosynostosis.
