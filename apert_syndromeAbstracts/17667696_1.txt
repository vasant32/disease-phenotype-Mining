A patient with Apert syndrome who underwent a monobloc osteotomy with distraction advancement sustained partial unilateral vision loss as a complication from a direct carotid-cavernous fistula. Successful embolization was used to treat the fistula. Precaution should be taken by craniofacial surgeons in performing similar procedures in patients with Apert syndrome because of their unique skull abnormalities.
