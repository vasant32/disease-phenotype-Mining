 OBJECT: Apert's syndrome is characterized by faciocraniosynostosis and severe bony and cutaneous syndactyly of all four limbs. The molecular basis for this syndrome appears remarkably specific: two adjacent amino acid substitutions (either S252W or P253R) occurring in the linking region between the second and third immunoglobulin domains of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)2 gene. The goal of this study was to examine the phenotype/genotype correlations in patients with Apert's syndrome. METHODS: In the present study, 36 patients with Apert's syndrome were screened for genetic mutations. Mutations were detected in all cases. In one of the patients there was a rare mutation consisting of a double-base pair substitution in the same codon (S252F). A phenotypical survey of our cases was performed and showed the clinical variability of this syndrome. In two patients there was no clinical or radiological evidence of craniosynostosis. In two other patients with atypical forms of syndactyly and cranial abnormalities, the detection of a specific mutation was helpful in making the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The P253R mutation appears to be associated with the more severe forms, with regard to the forms of syndactyly and to mental outcome. The fact that mutations found in patients with Apert' s syndrome are usually confined to a specific region of the FGFR2 exon IIIa may be useful in making the diagnosis and allowing genetic counseling in difficult cases.
