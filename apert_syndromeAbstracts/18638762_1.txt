A review of the clinical records and CT scan findings of 11 patients with Pfeiffer syndrome showed ventricular dilation in the majority. In 7 cases the ventriculomegaly was sufficiently severe as to be classified as hydrocephalus and warrant ventricular shunting. The common co-existence of hydrocephalus and multiple premature sutural fusion in Pfeiffer syndrome is a further factor in the apparently worse prognosis of this condition when compared to Crouzon and Apert syndrome. Primary cerebral anomalies as a causative factor for the development of hydrocephalus are infrequently recorded. Extensive craniosynostosis with cranial base distortion and constriction would appear to contribute to the production of hydrocephalus.
