Craniosynostosis or premature closure of the cranial sutures is a common abnormality occurring in about 1 in 2500 children. There is evidence of mendelian inheritance in some 20% of cases. Published reports of patients with structural alterations of the short arm of chromosome 7 have suggested that two or more genes for craniosynostosis may be situated in this region. The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (acrocephalosyndactyly type III) is one of the most common autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndromes. Results of molecular genetic linkage studies provide evidence for localisation of the gene responsible to distal chromosome 7p.
