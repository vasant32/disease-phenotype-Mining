One hundred children affected by craniosynostosis were operated on from January 1952 to February 1977. Forty-six patients were operated on within the first year of life, and only 9 after six years of age. In 27 cases only one cranial suture was synostotic (mostly the coronal: 15 cases). In 36 cases two sutures were involved (mostly coronal plus sagittal: 25 cases). In 28 cases all the cranial sutures were involved. Also included in this series are seven cases of Crouzon's, one of Apert's, and one of Carpenter's syndromes. The clinical, radiological, and surgical features of this condition are discussed, and the long-term results are reported.
