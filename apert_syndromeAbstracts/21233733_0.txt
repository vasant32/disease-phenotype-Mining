 BACKGROUND: In cases of surgery for syndromic craniosynostosis with posterior flattering, it is not possible to achieve sufficient expansion of the skull through fronto-orbital advancement alone. Although it is necessary to expand the occipital region, the surgery is risky and highly invasive. We applied the distraction osteogenesis technique for skull expansion and performed occipital expansion and fronto-orbital advancement in succession. METHODS: Three patients with syndromic craniosynostosis (2 with Crouzon syndrome, 1 with Pfeiffer syndrome) were treated in Juntendo University Hospital between 2002 and 2007. Using the distraction osteogenesis technique, we performed occipital advancement followed immediately by fronto-orbital advancement for 2 cases of Crouzon syndrome and performed fronto-orbital advancement followed by occipital advancement for a case of Pfeiffer syndrome. RESULTS: In all of the cases, we were able to perform bone extension of 25 mm or more and achieve sufficient skull expansion for both of the frontal and occipital regions. Within 1 year after the surgery, in all of the cases, favorable osteogenesis was observed in the distraction gap, and there were no bone defects. DISCUSSION: By using the distraction osteogenesis technique, the difficult procedure of occipital advancement can be performed relatively safely. In addition, as active expansion of the cranium is possible after the surgery, sufficient expansion of the cranium can be successfully performed to a degree that cannot be achieved through conventional methods. New bone is formed in the distraction gap, and there are no bone defects. The present method is extremely useful for skull formation in cases of syndromic craniosynostosis with posterior flattering.
