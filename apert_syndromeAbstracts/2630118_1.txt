After an experimental study on biodegradable implants for fixation purpose in skull plasties of the minipig we began a clinical trial. Six children aged 1-18 years and suffering from trigonocephaly, Morbus Apert and Morbus Crouzon as well as plagiocephaly underwent a reconstructive procedure of the skull and midface, mostly frontal advancement. The different part of skull have been fixed by biodegradable implants made of polylactate acid. Another two infants, one with a skull defect after removal of an encephalocele and the other for reconstruction of the skull after open cerebral injury and consecutive osteoclastic trepanation, have been treated with skull splitting. The two halves of the skull have been fixed by biodegradable material too. The follow-up of these 8 children now is from 2-20 months (medium 10 1/2 months). From the aesthetic point of view as well as from radiological and clinical signs we judge the result as good as with conventional materials, for example wire loops. No material had to be removed and CT scans show a fully resorption of the implants. The present paper shows the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative evolution.
