 INTRODUCTION: Horsley wax® is an efficient bone haemostatic agent commonly used in bone surgery. But it is non resorbable and surgeons should be aware of possible complications, which can appear many years later. OBSERVATION: We report three cases of foreign body granulomas due to bone wax. A 14-years-old female patient with an Apert syndrome underwent Le Fort III osteotomy and distraction osteogenesis; 3 years later, an inflammatory granuloma appeared in the temporal area. A 23-years-old female patient, traffic accident casualty, complained about pain in the hip 1 year after undergoing cervical spine surgery with iliac bone graft. A 35-years-old female patient underwent rhinoplasty with anterior nasal aperture surgery. She presented with an inflammatory reaction requiring several subsequent surgeries. DISCUSSION: Using Horsley wax® must be performed according to recommendations so as to prevent inflammatory or infectious complications, and to allow good bone healing. Surgeons must mention its use in the surgical report to avoid a delayed diagnosis in case of complications. There are alternatives to bone wax but they are less effective.
