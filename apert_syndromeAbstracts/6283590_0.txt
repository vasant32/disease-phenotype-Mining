Significant radiographic findings of the pediatric hand are described as far as they are useful for the diagnosis of a suspected clinical syndrome. Normal variants that can simulate pathological findings are demonstrated. Deviations of skeletal age from chronological age and their clinical significance are discussed. Diagnostically useful malformations (hexadactyly, syndactyly, brachyphalangy, cone shaped epiphyses and anomalies of the thumb) are presented in the context of typical cases of selected syndromes. The importance of establishing a correct diagnosis in these cases is stressed with regard to individual prognosis of the patient and genetic counselling of the family.
