Frontofacial monobloc advancement is one of the most rewarding techniques for correcting aesthetic and functional problems of patients with severe craniofacial synostosis, which can advance the upper and middle third of the face simultaneously. Application of gradual distraction technique has been reported to reduce notorious risks after a frontofacial monobloc advancement. The so-called "bibloc advancement" is a derivative of the frontofacial monobloc advancement. "Facial bloc" is horizontally divided into 2 different components: fronto-orbital component and maxillozygomatic component. From a different angle, it can be described as a combination of fronto-orbital advancement and Le Fort III advancement. Two pairs of distracters (1 internal for the supraorbital area and 1 external for the maxillozygomatic area with a pair of cross-facial pinning) were applied after the so-called bibloc osteotomy. Advancement of the upper and middle third of the face was done individually. This technique can be a good option for treating infants with severe syndromic craniofacial synostosis.
