Patients with Apert syndrome have bilateral coronal craniosynostosis as one of their many distinguishing features. Surgical correction of this deformity is the mainstay of treatment. Abnormal widening of the skull base progresses despite cranioplasty. We describe a patient for whom a skull molding cap (SMC) was used after barrel-stave osteotomy and orbital rim advancement. This successfully restricted widening of her skull base while allowing growth in other dimensions. Utilization of skull molding caps after cranial surgery shows promise in this setting.
