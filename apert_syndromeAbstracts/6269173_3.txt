Mohr's syndrome consists of an association of three types of malformation : oral, facial, and digital. It is very similar, therefore, to the syndrome of Papillon-LÃ©age and Psaume. Apart from this, precise, constant characteristics can be recognized which identify it as a separate entity. Firstly, the genetic mode of transmission differs. Secondly, clinical signs are dominated by the frequency and severity of the distal lesions, such that bilateral syndactyly of the big toe is a key element in the differential diagnosis.
