The anaesthetic technique chosen for a laparohysterectomy in a woman affected by Apert's acrocephalosyndactilia is described. Difficulties in performing tracheal intubation were overcome by mean of loco-regional anesthesia (LRA). In order to minimize the anaesthetic risk, a standardised preoperative evaluation and assessment integrating the usual investigations and the possibility of employing intubation techniques as alternative to direct laryngoscopy are suggested.
