The clinical study of the major cranio-facial malformations such as Apert syndrome, Treacher-Collins syndrome, Blepharophimosis and Bilateral Cleft Palate patients, lead us to note a similarity of the orbito-palpebral region. A characteristic obliquity and narrowness of the orbits associated with an antimongoloid eyelids disposal was noted after X-rays, CT-scan and clinical evaluation. Authors suggest a facial orthomorphic restoration of bilateral cleft palate patients by the "mask-lifting" procedure associated to the conventional maxillo-facial surgery.
