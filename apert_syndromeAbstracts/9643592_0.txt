The aim of this article was to present a treatment strategy for complex craniosynostoses, such as Apert syndrome and Crouzon's disease, based on the author's experience of over 16 years. The most favourable results of primary decompression have been achieved by the radical osteoclastic procedure described by Powiertowski. Subsequent frontal advancement and Le Fort III osteotomy are necessary in these patients when they reach 6-10 years of age. Orthopaedic treatment with a Delaire mask should be started immediately after the operation to achieve optimal growth of the skull base with anterior rotation of the maxilla and posterior rotation of the mandible, which leads to a much better result.
