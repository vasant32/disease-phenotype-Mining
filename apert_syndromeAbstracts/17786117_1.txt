We describe a female infant with complex craniosynostosis, significant craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay in which a de-novo apparently balanced translocation between chromosomes 7 and 18 [46,XX,t(7;18)(p15.3;q11.2)] was identified. Additional cytogenetic and molecular investigations identified a cryptic interstitial 7.6-10.6-Mb deletion of the region between bands 7p21.2 and 7p21.3 on the derivative chromosome 18. The deletion was of paternal origin and contained the TWIST1 gene, although her features were not completely characteristic of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The phenotype of this patient is likely further complicated by loss of other genes within the deleted region and/or disruption of a critical gene(s) at the sites of the breakpoints on chromosomes 7 and 18. This case illustrates the need for a systematic molecular study of breakpoints and the surrounding chromosomal regions in patients with apparently balanced rearrangements and phenotypic abnormalities.
