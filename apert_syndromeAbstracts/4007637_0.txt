Success in the treatment of Apert's syndrome depends not only on the quality of surgical correction but also upon its timing. Two nearly identical patients were treated with similar good surgical results. However, one was 12 years old at the time of surgery and the other fifteen months. The infant showed a good result, while the older child had little or no profit despite the anatomical correction of his hands.
