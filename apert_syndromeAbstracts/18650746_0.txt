Apert syndrome is a congenital condition characterized by craniosynostosis, syndactyly, and maxillary hypoplasia. Previous authors have outlined the management of craniofacial and extremity anomalies associated with this syndrome; however, there is a paucity of literature regarding the treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of Apert syndrome. Axillary osmidrosis, a chronic skin condition characterized by an excessive, axillary malodor resulting from apocrine gland dysfunction, can be particularly severe in patients with Apert syndrome. Herein, we describe a pediatric patient with Apert syndrome and severe axillary osmidrosis managed by an arthroscopic shaver technique of axillary glandular debridement and aspiration.
