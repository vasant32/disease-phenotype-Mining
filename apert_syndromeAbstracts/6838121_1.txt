We have employed a two-stage operative approach to the correction of Crouzon's/Apert's deformity. Extensive use of methyl methacrylate in cranioplasty and frontal bone advancement is employed to obtain finely detailed contours with excellent stability. By adhering to principles of separation of oral contamination and the methyl methacrylate, as well as the provision of adequate soft tissue coverage of the methyl methacrylate, the problems of infection and soft tissue breakdown can be minimized.
