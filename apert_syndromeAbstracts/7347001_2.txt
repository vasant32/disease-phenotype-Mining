Serial cephalometric radiographs of 55 patients with different types of premature craniofacial synostoses were analysed. The aim of the study was to answer the following four questions in an effort to provide a better rational for classification, treatment, and possibly add insight into the mechanisms controlling craniofacial growth. (1) Is the shape of the skull syndrome specific. (2) How does the craniofacial complex grow. (3) What is the effect of craniectomy on the growth of the cranium. (4) Can roentgencephalometry provide a rational basis for planning reconstructive surgery. The results were presented as answers to each of the questions restated under each type of craniosynostosis. i.e. oxycephaly, scaphocephaly, plagiocephaly, trigonocephaly, Crouzon syndrome, and Apert syndrome.
