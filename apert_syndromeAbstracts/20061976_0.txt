 BACKGROUND: Pyrexia after surgical procedure is a commonly observed phenomenon. However, it is not easy to distinguish pyrexia related to a postoperative complication from the normal temperature increase after surgery. The aims of this study were to establish a normal template for postoperative temperature course after transcranial surgery in patients with Apert syndrome and to investigate the correlation between the pattern of temperature increase and etiological factors. METHODS: Seventy-seven sequential case notes of patients with Apert syndrome were retrospectively reviewed to collect postoperative temperature courses. The mean change of temperature was plotted on a graph with trend line to compare the feature of the course in each possible factor. A separate group of those who underwent fronto-orbital advancement was independently evaluated. RESULTS: The temperature course had a bimodal distribution during the first 48 hours. However, those who underwent longer surgery, fronto-facial advancement, or those accompanied by complication seemed to have the more obvious third temperature peak around 50 hours postoperatively. This finding was also true in the independent fronto-orbital advancement group. Temperature courses without postoperative complication seemed to have bimodal distribution of temperature course; on the other hand, those with postoperative complication seemed to have the obvious third temperature peak around postoperative 50 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Together with our previous study, it was concluded that pyrexia after transcranial surgery had a bimodal distribution as a normal course within the first 48 hours postoperatively. Moreover, it was suggested that the third temperature peak around 50 hours postoperatively could be an indicator for a postoperative complication.
