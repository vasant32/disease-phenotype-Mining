The intubating laryngeal airway, air-Q ILA, was recently introduced in Japan. It has been used in adult patients for difficult airway management; however, there are few reports available on its use in pediatric patients. We report the use of the air-Q ILA in predicted difficult airway management in a 16-month-old patient with Apert syndrome characterized by acrocephalosyndactyly undergoing a syndactyly operation. It was somewhat difficult to keep his airway with a facemask, and an air-Q ILA was inserted. Following the ventilation via air-Q ILA, tracheal intubation guided by a tracheal fiberscope was attempted through the air-Q ILA. Five months after this operation, the patient again underwent the same operation. We managed his airway in the same way as previously, and the tracheal was intubated. This case shows that the air-Q ILA can be an alternative device in pediatric difficult airway management.
