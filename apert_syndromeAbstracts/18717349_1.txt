 OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effects of Le Fort III osteotomy and midface distraction osteogenesis (DO) on the upper-airway narrow. METHODS: Since 2000, 11 cases (10 cases of Crouzon syndrome and 1 case of Apert syndrome) with severe midface deficiency were treated with Le Fort III osteotomy and midface DO. The section area of different parts of upper-airway were tested by computer assistants image measurement preoperatively and postoperatively. Some patients received sleep function monitoring. RESULTS: The face appearance and the function of upper-airway improved significantly after Le Fort III osteotomy and Midface DO. The section area at the level of posterior nasal spine and uvula increased obviously after treatment (P < 0.05), however the section area at the level of epiglottis and separation between airway and esophagus were not obviously enlarged (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Midface DO after Le Fort III osteotomy can effectively improve the upper-airway narrow, especially the upper part from uvula.
