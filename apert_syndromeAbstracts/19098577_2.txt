Osteogenesis distraction is an increasingly used technique for the correction of facial deformities because it offers a faster and more controlled growth of the hypoplasic bone along with the elongation of the soft tissues.

Lorenz, Jacksonville, FL) and custom-made midface osteotomies for the correction of severe hypoplasia.
