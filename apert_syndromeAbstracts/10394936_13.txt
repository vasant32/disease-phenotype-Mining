Pfeiffer syndrome (PS) is one of the classical craniosynostosis syndromes correlated with specific mutations in the human fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes, FGFR1 and FGFR2. In this study, we set out to examine the exons in FGFR2 most commonly associated with mutations in PS, exons IIIa and IIIc, in a panel of 78 unrelated individuals with PS by the most sensitive method (direct DNA sequencing). We have identified a total of 18 different mutations among 40 patients; eight of these mutations have not been previously described. The mutational spectrum displays a non-random character with the frequent involvement of cysteine codons.
