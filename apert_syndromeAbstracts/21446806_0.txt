We studied orthognathic correction of dentofacial deformities in patients with craniofacial syndromes (Crouzon, Apert, and Treacher Collins) during a 5-year period. The number of patients treated within this time period was 17 with Crouzon syndrome, 12 with Apert syndrome, and six with Treacher Collins syndrome. Individual follow-up was 2.5 years. Bimaxillary operation, sometimes with genioplasty, has been done after preoperative orthodontic treatment of 1.5-2.5 years. Clinical and radiographic cephalometric evaluations of the orthodontic results were made. The functional and aesthetic results were satisfactory in most patients, although there were large individual variations. The experience of a craniofacial centre such as the one in Gothenburg, Sweden, which has different odontological and medical specialities, is invaluable for an optimal result.
