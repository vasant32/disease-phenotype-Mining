It has been recognized that using the maxillary teeth to deliver extraoral force to the maxilla not only results in sutural remodeling but also periodontal remodeling and tooth movement. In patients with severe maxillomandibular malrelationships, the potential for tooth movement often limits the amount and duration of extraoral force and, consequently, affects the success of treatment. This case report describes a technique to intentionally ankylose deciduous teeth in a patient with severe maxillary retrusion. The ankylosed teeth were used as abutments to deliver an anteriorly directed intermittent extraoral force. After 12 months of treatment, the anterior crossbite was nearly corrected. At that point the ankylosed teeth loosened because of root resorption and the treatment was terminated. Cephalometric superimposition demonstrated that the occlusal correction was the result of anterior maxillary movement with little mandibular growth and no movement of the ankylosed teeth. The results suggest that intentionally ankylosed teeth may be used as abutments for extraoral traction in patients with a severe disturbance in maxillary growth.
