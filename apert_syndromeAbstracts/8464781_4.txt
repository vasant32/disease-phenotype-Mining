The term "common origin of the carotid arteries" (COCA) has been proposed to replace the older terms "origin of the left carotid artery from the innominate stem" and "bicarotid trunk with anomalous right or left subclavian artery." These anatomic patterns are usually reported to occur in about 11% of whites and 20-25% of blacks and have been reported to have increased frequency in patients with esophageal atresia-tracheoesophageal fistula, DiGeorge anomaly, and anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. COCA is a significant, if not invariant, feature of the great arteries in the condition usually called in the more recent literature "anomalous origin of the innominate artery," the most frequent cause of symptomatic tracheal compression by anomalous systemic arteries. Analysis of associations of COCA with various other congenital cardiovascular lesions showed, in addition, significant association with congenital polyvalvular disease, truncus arteriosus, aorticopulmonary window, trisomy 13, 18, and 21 syndromes, acrocephalosyndactyly (especially Apert syndrome), tetralogy of Fallot not associated with DiGeorge anomaly, and clinical Noonan phenotype. Pentalogy of Cantrell was associated with no increase in incidence of COCA.
