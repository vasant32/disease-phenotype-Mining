Greig cephalopolysyndactyly is a rare autosomic dominant syndrome caused by mutations in GLI3 gene located on cytoband 7p14.1 and characterized by the clinical triad of polysyndactyly, macrocephaly and hypertelorism. In approximately 20% of the cases a deletion of variable size is detected. If deletion is large and affects other genes as well as GLI3, a more severe phenotype is expected. Thus, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly contiguous gene syndrome is a multiple malformation syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of GLI3 and adjacent genes. We describe the case of a newborn female with polysyndactyly, hypertelorism and microcephaly and a 1.5 Mb 7p14.1 microdeletion of paternal origin diagnosed by array-CGH.
