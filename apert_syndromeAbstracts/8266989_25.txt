Chromosome analysis of a male infant and his mother with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome demonstrated an apparently balanced translocation, t(2;7)(p23;p22). This association lends support to localization of the gene for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome to the 7p2 region and supports further involvement of gene(s) in the 7p22 region.
