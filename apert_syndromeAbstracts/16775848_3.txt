The Apert syndrome (Acrocephalosyndactyly) is one of the craniosynostotic syndromes, which is often associated with congenial malformation in the temporal bone. We present a case of a 13 year old girl with Apert syndrome. By planning a tympanoplasty we arranged a CT-scan of the temporal bones. It demonstrated next to some other malformations a high jugular bulb on both sides, on the right side just with a membraneous bound to the external ear canal. In a recherche we did not find a higher incidence of high jugular bulb in Apert-syndrome and other craniosynostotic syndromes. However as we expect different malformations of the temporal bone in Apert syndrome we recommend an otorhinolaryngeal examination in each of these patients and a ct scan of the temporal bone before any operation of the middle ear.
