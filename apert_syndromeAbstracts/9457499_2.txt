We report on a sporadic case of Pfeiffer syndrome in a male newborn with complex craniosynostosis, broad thumbs and great toes and early demise. SSCP and direct sequencing revealed a missense mutation at position 1037 of the exon B (or IIIc) of the FGFR2 gene (codon 342) resulting in a cysteine to serine modification (TGC-TCC). Genotype-phenotype correlations between the FGFRs mutations and the different craniosynostotic syndromes are discussed.
