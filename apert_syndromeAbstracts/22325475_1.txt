We review 3 cases where array comparative genomic hybridization made a difference in the medical management of the patient, ended the diagnostic odyssey, predicted prognosis for the patient, and/or provided closure to the family. Comparative genomic hybridization is a useful tool for testing individuals with clinical examinations suggestive of a genetic syndrome but in which a specific syndrome may be difficult to pinpoint. The cost is similar to that of a standard karyotype but there is a higher yield in children and adults with clinical signs of a genetic syndrome.
