A new technique in craniofacial surgery to separate the cranial and nasal cavities from each other is described. This can be achieved by preserving the complete anterior cranial fossa while simultaneously correcting the forehead, orbit, and face in craniofacial dysostosis. With this procedure, the risk of infection deriving from nasal sinuses and cavities should be minimized.
