This paper describes two cases of acrocephalosyndactylia (Apert's syndrome). Both very clearly showed the characteristic malformations. In addition, both patients showed synostosis between the calcaneus and the cuboid bone; this synostosis is not a typical feature of Apert's syndrome, but has been described in the literature once before.
