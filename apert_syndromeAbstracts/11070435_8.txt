We present 2 children with severe syndromal craniosynostosis who were in need of urgent midface advancement surgery due to recurrent ocular dislocations (Pfeiffer's syndrome type II) or severe upper respiratory obstruction (Crouzon's syndrome). They were operated using distraction osteogenesis, with gradual midface or monobloc advancements. In the Pfeiffer patient, a maxillary distraction of 25 mm achieved effective cessation of ocular dislocations, whereas a 23-mm monobloc advancement in the Crouzon patient achieved cessation of nocturnal arterial desaturations. No major postoperative complications were recorded. Distraction osteogenesis has become a versatile and safe technique that allows for large skeletal advancements.
