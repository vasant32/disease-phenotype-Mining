The authors discuss foot abnormalities in Apert's syndrome (acrocephalo-syndactyly). Characteristic of these deformities are bilateral, mostly symmetrical syndactlys of the toes; incorrect hyperextension positions of the first toe with large toes in flexed positions; intermetatarsal synostoeses, above all between the first and second metatarsal bones; multiple synostoses in the tarsal region; bi- and monophalanges with pseudo-, delta- or arcuate epiphyses. A classification of Apert's foot is presented, using 68 examples from the literature and 12 cases treated by the authors. The calssification is analogous to the hand deformities in Apert's syndrome. Three types can be distinguished: In type I, toes II-IV are webbed together. However, the large and small toes are still well separated. Syndactilys of toes II-V are present in type II, and all toes have grown together in type III. The deformity can be accompanied by stress pain and difficulties in providing shoes. In this case surgical correction is indicated in childhood: the incorrect position of the large toe is eliminated. Good results can be achieved via osteotomies of the metatarsal bones and resections of the intermetatarsal bone bridges.
