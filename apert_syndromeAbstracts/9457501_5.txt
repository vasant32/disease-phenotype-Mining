Apert's syndrome is characterized by severe craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, symmetric syndactyly of the hands and sometimes feet. Cognitive functioning was evaluated in 11 children between 2.5 and 12.3 years. Four children had a normal IQ, four children had an intellectual ability in the borderline range and three children were mentally retarded. There was a consistent relative deficit in short-term memory and arithmetics. Some recommendations for psychological monitoring are discussed.
