Four psychiatric patients with SCS are described. All exhibited essential tremor, minimal cerebral dysfunctions, speech disorders, bradyphrenia, disorders of personality with psychasthenie and suspicious traits, restrictions, increased irritability and depressivity, one case of mutism due to abnormal reaction and one of alcohol hallucinosis. The possibility of cosmetic handicap caused by craniofacial dysplasia should be taken into mind and perhaps surgically corrected. Because the craniofacial dysplasia is mostly moderate and the syndactylies are slight the SCS remains often unrecognized, but apart from psychic maldevelopment it is significant as the result of frequent association with other malformations.
