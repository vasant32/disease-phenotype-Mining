PURPOSE: To report on the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and dosage-sensitive Southern blot analysis in the molecular diagnosis of patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. METHODS: FISH and dosage-sensitive Southern blot analysis utilizing TWIST gene probes were performed on patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome but without an identifiable TWIST sequence variation. RESULTS: Four unrelated patients with a deletion of the TWIST gene were identified by Southern blot; one of them had a complex chromosomal rearrangement involving 7p21 and no apparent deletion by FISH, suggesting a smaller deletion in the region including the TWIST gene. A fifth patient had an abnormal TWIST gene fragment on Southern blot analysis that segregated with the disease in the family; FISH was normal in this patient, suggesting a partial deletion or rearrangement in or near the gene. CONCLUSION: FISH and dosage-sensitive Southern blot analysis are useful diagnostic tools in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome without TWIST sequence variation.
