 INTRODUCTION: Management of patients with syndromal craniosynostosis is probably one of the greatest challenges. They usually present with variable deformities yet share common characteristics. Patients with Crouzon and Aperts syndrome present with exorbitism and midface hypoplasia. Exorbitism is a protrusion of the eyeball due to a decrease in the capacity of the orbital container, and it may lead to drastic consequences if left untreated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four cases with exorbitism and midface hypoplasia. Three presented with Aperts syndrome and one with Crouzon syndrome. They all underwent an intraoral modified Le Fort III osteotomy followed by midface distraction osteogenesis. CONCLUSION: Distraction osteogenesis of the midface is a safe and highly effective method in managing exorbitism associated with midface deficiency.
