Apert's syndrome is a rare malformation (dysostosis), probably of a hereditary nature. It is characterised by craniostenosis, caused by synostosis of the coronal sutures, and by bilateral and symmetrical membranous syndactyly of the hands and feet, to which metacarpal, metatarsal and phalangeal synostoses are associated. Less frequent are dysplastic modifications in other osteo-articular regions and malformations of the viscerae. The authors expose and discuss the etiopathogenetic, clinical and radiographic aspects of this syndrome, in relation to three clinical cases which came to their observation.
