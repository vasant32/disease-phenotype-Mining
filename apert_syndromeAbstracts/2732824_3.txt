Midface advancement by Le Fort III osteotomy is a common procedure in craniofacial surgery. However, little data exist concerning the effect of midface advancement on mandibular growth. This is a retrospective study of 38 patients from two craniofacial centers who had Le Fort III osteotomy. The aims of this investigation were to document the size and shape of the mandible in Crouzon and Apert syndromes and to determine the effect on these parameters of downward and forward movement of the midface. The syndrome patients had increased gonial angle, increased MP-SN, increased ramus height, and increased ratio of ramus height to body length when compared with normal standards. Patients operated during growth and those operated when growth was completed had similar mandibular size and shape indicating that Le Fort III osteotomy had no measurable effect on these parameters. Inclination of the mandible to the anterior cranial base was increased by the operation and remained unchanged during the follow-up period. The results of this study indicate that the size and morphology of the mandible are similar in Crouzon and Apert syndromes. The pattern of growth is more vertical in the syndrome patients than in normals. Le Fort III osteotomy in growing children does not result in altered mandibular size and shape despite backward rotation of the mandible as a result of midface advancement.
