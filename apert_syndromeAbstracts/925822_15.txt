A family is described in which 15 persons in five generations are affected with a complex of skeletal malformations which variably includes peculiar asymmetric facies, delayed closure of large fontanels, brachycephaly, acrocephaly, brachydactyly, cutaneous syndactyly, broad great toes, and mild shortness of stature. Although craniosynostosis is either lacking or relatively mild in the members of this family, their features are otherwise strikingly similar to those of patients with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. We believe the findings in this family indicate that the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome comprises a broad pattern of carniofacial and other skeletal malformations in which craniosynostosis may sometimes occur.
