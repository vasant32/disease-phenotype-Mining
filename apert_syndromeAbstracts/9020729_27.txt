Severe craniofacial synostosis can be a devastating problem for a newborn infant. Reasons for early surgical intervention include cranial stenosis, hydrocephalus, inadequate globe and corneal protection, compromised airway patency, and feeding problems. In this preliminary report, we describe the management of severe craniofacial synostosis in a newborn infant by means of cranial and midfacial distraction osteogenesis.
