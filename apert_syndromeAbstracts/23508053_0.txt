BACKGROUND:: Lefort 3 distraction (LF3D) advances the Apert midface, but leaves the concavity seen on "worm's eye" view and the vertical compression of the central midface untreated. We propose that Lefort II distraction and simultaneous zygomatic repositioning (LF2ZR) can move the central midface independent of the lateral orbits to treat the facial deformity in all three dimensions. The purpose of this paper was to determine if LF2ZR results in more normal facial proportions in Apert syndrome than LF3D. METHOD:: CT scan analyses were performed before and after distraction in patients undergoing LF3D (n=5) and LF2ZR (n=4). Movement of the central compared to lateral face was measured relative to skull base, as well as axial facial ratios (AFR) representing "worm's eye" curvature, and vertical facial ratios (VFR) representing relative vertical facial height on frontal view. Unoperated Crouzon (n=5) and normal (n=6) controls were analyzed for comparison. RESULTS:: With LF3D, facial ratios did not change with surgery and remained lower (p<0.01) than normal and Crouzon controls. Although the face was advanced, its shape remained abnormal. With LF2ZR the central face advanced 12.8mm and lengthened 12.4mm more than the lateral orbit. This differential movement changed the abnormal facial ratios that were present before surgery into ratios that were not significantly different from normal controls. CONCLUSION:: Compared to LF3D, LF2ZR normalizes the position and the shape of the Apert face, resulting in more desirable periorbital and facial balance. LF2ZR has replaced LF3D in the treatment of the Apert midface in our center.
