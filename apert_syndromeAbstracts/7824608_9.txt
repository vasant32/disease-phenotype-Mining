The present study was undertaken to characterize the intracranial volume in patients with Apert syndrome. Radiographic and CT-based techniques for measuring intracranial volume were found to show close correlation when validated in dry normal adult skulls. A standard-deviation score of intracranial volume, determined from CT scans in 20 patients with Apert syndrome from birth to 30 years of age, was calculated with reference to a normative database of age- and sex-matched controls. Analysis of the data showed no significant difference in standard-deviation score between Apert patients with or without ventriculomegaly, before or after cranial vault surgery, or between male and female patients. The mean standard-deviation score among all Apert CT scans compared with normative data was 3.1, which was highly significant (p < 0.001). However, the growth curves showed no significant difference in intracranial volume between Apert and normal patients below 3.5 months of age. In summary, intracranial volume in Apert syndrome is within normal range at birth but increases to greater than 3 standard deviations above normal after 3.5 months of age, a finding independent of cranial vault surgery.
