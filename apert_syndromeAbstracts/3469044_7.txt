In 1983, we evaluated the stability of midface position after Le Fort III advancement for midface hypoplasia secondary to Crouzon's or Apert's syndromes. The patients were operated upon from 1972 to 1980, and mean follow-up was 5.8 years (Kaban et al, 1984). In this study, we present an additional 3 1/2 year follow-up of these patients to look at what happens to midface position after Le Fort III osteotomy in growing and nongrowing patients.
