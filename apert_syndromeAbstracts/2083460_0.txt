Since skin problems as decubitus and infections are well known risks in osteoplastic trepanations in congenital malformations in children, we searched for a reduction in size of the implants and the possibility to use biodegradable materials. After design of special constructions regarding dimension and stability purposes for children below one year, we performed osteoplastic trepanations in 27 minipigs. In 78% the healing was uneventful and the osteoplasty remained in place whereas in 22% (= 6 animals) we observed a local infection which lead to loss of implants as well as cranioplasty in 3 animals. Based on this research, we used our biodegradable implants in osteoplastic trepanations of congenital craniostenosis in children. The postoperative follow-up is now from 3 to 6 months in 4 children and the results are perfect in all. We did not observe any local infection, neither cutaneous problems, even not in bilateral frontal advancement and floating forehead procedures. The implants are presented as well as the results in animal research and the first follow-up in 4 children.
