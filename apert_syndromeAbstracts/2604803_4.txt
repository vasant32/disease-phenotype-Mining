Apert syndrome and septo-optic dysplasia are rare congenital structural disorders which have not been associated previously; we report a female infant with this association. Brain sonography and computed tomography revealed agenesis of the septum pellucidum; optic hypoplasia was demonstrated by funduscopic evaluation. We postulate that an embryopathic factor, which manifests at 5-6 weeks gestation, may result in this new association. Transverse craniectomy was performed in the hope of preserving brain development. Neither hypopituitarism nor adrenal insufficiency was observed; however, clinical manifestations and laboratory data provided evidence of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome.
