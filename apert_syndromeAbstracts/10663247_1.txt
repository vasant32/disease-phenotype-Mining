Nine patients with achondroplasia and one patient with Apert syndrome underwent the surgical lengthening of both humerus and simultaneous correction of both associated bone deformity. An unilateral external fixator was applied to the lateral aspect of the humerus with four half-pins and percutaneous predrilling osteotomy was performed at the apex of flexion deformity of the bone. During the waiting period before distraction, the flexion deformity of the distal humerus was corrected using an additional external fixator. Slow gradual distraction was subsequently carried out at a rate of 0. 25 mm every 6 hours. The average lengthening was 8 cm (range 7.5 to 9 cm), the overall treatment time 312 days (range 192 to 406 days), and the average healing index 39.0 days/cm. The average correction of the elbow flexion deformity was 20 degrees. We believe this treatment is useful to improve the function of the arms and the activity of daily living for the patients with bilateral short humeri.
