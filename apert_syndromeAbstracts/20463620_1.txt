 BACKGROUND: Patients with Apert, Crouzon, and Pfeiffer syndromes who have severe midfacial hypoplasia are treated by Le Fort III midface advancement. The purpose of this study was to examine long-term (10-year) midface skeletal stability and growth following Le Fort III midface advancement in growing children. METHODS: A review of 192 patients with syndromic craniosynostosis treated by classic (nondistracted) Le Fort III advancement osteotomy between 1973 and 1998 was performed. Twenty-five patients met the inclusion criteria (age at surgery < 11 years and availability of cephalograms of diagnostic quality before treatment, after surgery, and at 1-, 5-, and 10-year follow-up). The mean age at the time of surgery was 5.8 years and the diagnosis was either Crouzon (n = 10), Apert (n = 9), or Pfeiffer (n = 6) syndrome. RESULTS: After surgery, point A advanced sagittally 10.72 mm and moved downward 3.77 mm. At 1 year, point A moved forward 0.10 mm and downward 0.47 mm. At 5 years, point A moved back 0.18 mm, whereas at 10 years it advanced 0.12 mm. During the same periods, however, pogonion came forward 5.72 mm and 7.32 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Le Fort III midface advancement in growing children with syndromic craniosynostosis is stable after the first year postoperatively. There is minimal horizontal growth of the midface between postoperative years 5 and 10, although the mandible continues to grow. Due to the differential growth rate of the midface and mandible, the facial profile becomes concave, thereby necessitating secondary midface surgery at the completion of skeletal growth.
