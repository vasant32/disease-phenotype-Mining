Jackson-Weiss syndrome (JWS) is a condition consisting of craniosynostosis characterized by premature fusion of the cranial sutures and/or characteristic radiographic anomalies of the feet. The condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with high penetrance and variable expressivity. Six different mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 have been identified in patients with the clinical diagnosis of JWS. Jabs et al. [1994: Nat Genet 8:275-279] identified an Ala344Gly substitution in two branches of the family in which the clinical syndrome was originally described. This is the only publication to document this mutation in a family with the clinical diagnosis of JWS. In this study, we have identified a previously unrecognized branch of the original family with individuals that meet the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of JWS. We demonstrate that a mutation that produces the Ala344Gly substitution is present in affected members. This family illustrates the widely variable expression of the mutation, including a novel phenotype in the proband with a leg-length discrepancy and unilateral absence of the fifth digital ray in her right foot. We identify the clinical and detailed radiographic features of each affected individual and offer considerations when making the diagnosis of JWS.
