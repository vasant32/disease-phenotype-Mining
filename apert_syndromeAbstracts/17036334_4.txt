Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is caused by mutations in the TWIST gene on chromosome 7p21.2. However, Muenke et al. [(1997); Am J Hum Genet 91: 555-564] described a new subgroup carrying the Pro250Arg mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 gene on chromosome 4p16. Uni or bicoronal synostosis appears to be the main clinical finding in both syndromes. We observed trigonocephaly as a new manifestation in Muenke syndrome. As a consequence we advise to routinely perform mutation analysis of the FGFR1, 2, and 3 genes in children with non-syndromic trigonocephaly.
