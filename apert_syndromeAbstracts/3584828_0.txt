The authors present a review of the most commonly observed ophthalmological troubles in 244 cases of children affected by cranio-facio stenoses and hospitalized for a first examination. The fundus examination shows that nearly all types of cranio-facio stenoses can be complicated by intracranial hypertension with potential damage on the optic nerve. The hyper and hypotelorisms, particularly frequent, carry along aesthetic prejudice and effect on the ocular motility. In the most severe forms of the diseases (Alport), pseudo-exophthalmy by retrusion of the face can justify preventive surgical procedures in emergency. Squint is frequent (36.5%). All types can be found. Finally, the authors certify the frequency and the seriousness of ocular repercussion, even in so called benign types of cranio-stenoses, such as plagiocephaly, trigonocephaly, and scaphocephaly.
