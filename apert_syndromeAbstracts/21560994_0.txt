Standard two-dimensional ultrasound has been used to aid prenatal visualization and detection of anomalies for the past 60 years. Three-dimensional ultrasound, introduced in the 1980s, provides the additional capability of examining the in utero environment from a variety of different angles. Use of this technology in conjunction with standard two-dimensional ultrasound can lead to a more thorough evaluation of structural defects and a greater patient understanding of genetic conditions.
