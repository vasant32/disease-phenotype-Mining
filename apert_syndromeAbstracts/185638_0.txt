We describe our method of operation for syndactyly repair and our results in 62 patients (74 hands, 143 commissures), all treated more than two years ago. The operation was performed on patients aged from 17 months to two years (except those with acrosyndactyly). Postoperative web formation was not seen in any of these patients.
