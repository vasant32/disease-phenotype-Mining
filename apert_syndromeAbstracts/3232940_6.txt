Thirty cases of constriction band syndrome diagnosed and treated with surgery at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, during 1973 to 1986 are reported. The incidence of this congenital anomaly could not be verified in this series because the number of cases was limited and the cause could not be concluded. The less frequent site of constriction band was the thumb, but acrocephalosyndactyly was the most common associated anomaly. All 30 cases were treated with surgery. One-stage Z-plasty encircling the limb was performed for those with pure constriction band. Cases of acrocephalosyndactyly were treated with staged separation of the digits as well as local flap and skin grafts. Good results were achieved in 16 of 20 patients with constriction band alone and in 4 of 10 acrosyndactyly cases. No compromised circulation of the distal limb or total flap loss was encountered in this study. This type of surgery certainly gives encouraging results.
