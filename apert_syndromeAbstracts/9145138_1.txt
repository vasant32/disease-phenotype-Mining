Imaging of the Apert syndrome hand is usually done with plain x-rays. This gives only a limited assessment of the grossly abnormal anatomy. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have the ability to comprehensively demonstrate the spatial arrangement of the bones as well as the anatomy of the soft-tissue structures. This paper demonstrates the use of these two imaging modalities in the complex Apert syndrome hand to improve surgical planning and treatment.
