Authors describe 6 cases (3 women, 3 men) affected by Apert syndrome (acrocephalosyndactyly). Clinical material has been documented since 1953. They concentrate on the description of individual clinical cases on the basis of objective and radiograph examination of patients. They describe surgical procedure of syndactyly between the thumb and 2nd-5th digits on both hands. Prior to 1998 they started with separation of digits at the age of 3-5 years. After 1998 they began with it as early as at the age of 3-6 months. For the reconstruction of lateral aspects of separated digits and for the creation of inter-digital space they use "zig-zag" incision and for covering the resulting skin defects they use skin transplants. During separation of 2nd-4th digits they extirpate all phalanges of 3rd digit and they leave metacarpal III in situ by which they create a three-digit hand with a relatively good functional result.
