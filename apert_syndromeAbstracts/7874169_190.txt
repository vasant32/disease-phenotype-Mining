Pfeiffer syndrome (PS) is one of the classic autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndromes with craniofacial anomalies and characteristic broad thumbs and big toes. We have previously mapped one of the genes for PS to the centromeric region of chromosome 8 by linkage analysis. Here we present evidence that mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) gene, which maps to 8p, cause one form of familial Pfeiffer syndrome. A C to G transversion in exon 5, predicting a proline to arginine substitution in the putative extracellular domain, was identified in all affected members of five unrelated PS families but not in any unaffected individuals. FGFR1 therefore becomes the third fibroblast growth factor receptor to be associated with an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder.
