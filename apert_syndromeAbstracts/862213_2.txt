This report describes and discusses the very rare occurrence of two heritable traits, the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (21 hydroxylase deficiency, salt-losing type) in a female infant whose father presents the clinical manifestations of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Family study revealed no other instances of the recessively inherited adrenogenital syndrome. Other literature cases combining acrocephalosyndactyly and urogenital anomalies are discussed and compared.
