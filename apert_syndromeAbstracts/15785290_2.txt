Apert syndrome is characterized by craniosynostosis, central nervous system anomalies, midface hypoplasia, and syndactyly. Current research has focused on genetic and neurologic correlates. Cognitive assessment has been primarily limited to global intellectual evaluations, which can fail to detect the diverse cognitive attributes of these children at an individual level. This report describes in detail the neuropsychological profiles of 2 children with Apert syndrome, incorporating clinical, radiographic, molecular and surgical data. One child showed intellectual deficits consistent with a moderate intellectual disability. The second child, while of normal intelligence, displayed neuropsychological deficits associated with anterior-brain-region cognitive functions. These data highlight the diversity of neuropsychological outcomes in Apert syndrome in the same genetic mutation and underline the importance of detailed neuropsychological evaluations as integral to the management protocols of affected individuals.
