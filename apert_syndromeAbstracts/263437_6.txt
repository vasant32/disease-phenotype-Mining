Previous reports have noted a constant association between the Carpenter syndrome (acrocephalopolysyndactyly, type II) and mental retardation. We report two patients with this condition with normal intelligence. These observations indicate that mental deficiency is not necessarily a component of the Carpenter syndrome and that early surgical correction of the craniosynostoses may improve the chances of normal mentality.
