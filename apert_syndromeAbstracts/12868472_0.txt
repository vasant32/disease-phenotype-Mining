We report a girl with septo-optic dysplasia in association with subglottic stenosis, sagittal craniosynostosis, osteoporosis and dental anomalies. It is uncommon for patients with septo-optic dysplasia to have multiple, extra-cranial malformations. A number of differential diagnoses were considered in this case, including Cole-Carpenter syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome and osteoglophonic dwarfism. However, none can account for all the abnormalities seen. We therefore believe that this is a previously unreported, but highly distinctive, phenotype.
