The effectiveness of the "floating forehead" operation for treating brachycephaly in infants has been assessed. All children who had undergone this procedure at the HÃ´pital des Enfants Malades between 1977 and 1984 were reviewed retrospectively by an independent observer. Particular attention was paid to the effects on cranial growth, facial growth and morphology.
