A review of Pfeiffer's syndrome patients presenting in infancy identifies characteristic patterns of onset and progression of premature sutural fusion. Classic Pfeiffer's syndrome manifests symmetrical bicoronal synostosis; all other sutures are normal. The remaining patients, with a more extreme phenotypic expression, have superimposed on bicoronal synostosis progressive involvement of other cranial sutures, frequent hydrocephalus and craniolacunae, suggesting craniostenosis and intracranial hypertension. Although similar in clinical features and outcome, these patients have been subgrouped according to the presence or absence of a cloverleaf skull anomaly.
