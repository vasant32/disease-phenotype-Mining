Pfeiffer syndrome is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Three clinical subtypes have been delineated based on the severity of acrocephalysyndactyly and associated manifestations. Severe cases are usually sporadic and caused by a number of different mutations in exons IIIa and IIIc of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene. Mild cases are either sporadic or familial and are caused by mutations in FGFR2 or FGFR1, respectively. We report on two individuals with different novel de novo mutations in FGFR2. The first is a 17-year-old male who has a severe phenotype, within the spectrum of subtype 1 including severe ocular proptosis, elbow ankylosis, visceral anomalies, and normal intelligence. This patient was found to have a novel complex mutation at the 3' acceptor site of exon IIIc of FGFR2, denoted as C952-3 del10insACC. The other patient, a 2-year-old female, has a mild phenotype, typical of the classic subtype 1 including brachycephaly with coronal synostosis and hypertelorism. She was also found to have a mutation at the 3' acceptor site (the same splice site) of exon IIIc of FGFR2, a point mutation designated as 952-1G-->A. Speculation on the molecular mechanisms that cause severe and mild phenotypes is presented in relation to these two cases.
