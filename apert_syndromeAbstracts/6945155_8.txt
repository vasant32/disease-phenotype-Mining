Results of this cephalometric study of the dimensions of the nasopharynx in the syndromes of Apert and Crouzon concur with information previously reported both from this and other centers, enlarging the data base to direct attention to changes in these dimensions with growth of the patient. Alterations of the nasopharyngeal architecture in these syndromes include reduction in pharyngeal height, width, and depth; increased length and thickness of the velum; decreased length of the hard palate; and marked reduction in the posterior cranial base with somewhat less remarkable changes in the anterior cranial base. Increased basilar kyphosis evident in some patients contributes to the reduction in nasopharyngeal space. Most of these deviations are present early in life and tend to become worse as the patient matures. The combination of reduced nasopharyngeal dimensions and reduced patency of the posterior nasal choanae poses the threat of respiratory embarrassment and cor pulmonale, particularly in the young child.
