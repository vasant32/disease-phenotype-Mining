A 6-year-old girl with Carpenter's syndrome is reported who, in spite of a considerably distorted and small calvarium at birth, has normal mental development. Cranio-facial surgery was carried out in infancy, but its role in respect to mental development is difficult to assess since unoperated patients with normal intelligence and Carpenter's syndrome have been widely reported. Nevertheless, early cranio-facial surgery is recommended for cosmetic reasons.
