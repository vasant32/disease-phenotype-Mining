We present a case of a 5-year-old child who underwent four operations (three for syndactyly of the hands and one for craniofacial corrections). At the third hour of his craniofacial operation, his EtCO2 started to increase and airway resistance was encountered during manual ventilation. The position of the head and neck was checked. An increase in secretion with oral and endotracheal aspiration and a decrease in saturation were observed. When breath sounds disappeared, the patient was reintubated orally. The nasal tube was obstructed with a mucolytic plug. There was no problem during the other operations. This case is presented since anaesthesiologists should be aware of the high incidence of respiratory complications in Apert syndrome.
