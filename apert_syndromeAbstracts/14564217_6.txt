Patients affected by Pfeiffer syndrome generally present with syndromic craniosynostosis and typical limb defects including broad thumbs, wide halluces with varus deformity, toe syndactyly and sometimes elbow ankylosis. This autosomal dominant condition can be caused by mutations in either fibroblast growth factor receptor gene type 1 or 2 (FGFR1 or FGFR2). We report four new affected families showing an FGFR1 P252R mutation and emphasize the characteristic malformations of the feet in this form of Pfeiffer syndrome. In one family this was the only abnormality.
