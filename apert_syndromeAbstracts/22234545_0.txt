 PURPOSE: We conducted this study to gauge the health-related problems, quality of life and the performance of the Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI-3) in patients with syndromic and complex craniosynostosis. Patients with syndromic and complex craniosynostosis have various physical and mental problems. More insight on these problems, per syndrome, could provide guidance to improve patient treatment and follow-up. METHODS: A cross-sectional, comparative study on 131 patients and their parents was performed. Health-related quality of life was measured with the HUI-3 and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). All data were compared to a normative Dutch population. Vision, hearing and intelligence were objectively measured. RESULTS: The HUI-3 and the VAS were significant lower compared to the normative Dutch population. All syndromes have a high prevalence of vision and speech problems. Cognitive problems were mainly reported in patients with Apert, Crouzon and Muenke syndrome. Ambulation and dexterity problems were seen in Apert, Crouzon, Saethre-Chotzen and complex craniosynostosis. Only patients with Apert syndrome scored significantly worse on pain. The HUI-3 had a medium to strong correlation with the objectively measured outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The overall quality of life is lower in patients with syndromic and complex craniosynostosis. To improve quality of life, more attention is needed for problems with vision and speech.
