We report severe nodulocystic acne in a 21-year-old man associated with ectrodactyly of the right foot and soft-tissue syndactyly of the third and fourth left fingers, and the first to fourth left toes. His acne was resistant to conventional topical (clindamycin phosphate, erythromycin, tretinoin, peeling agents) and systemic (tetracycline, erythromycin) antiacne medications. Moderate improvement was achieved with systemic isotretinoin. Apart from presenting this case, we imply the disparity of the clinical characteristics of our case and those of Apert syndrome, a rare congenital condition with craniofacial anomalies, symmetric syndactyly of the digits, and acneiform eruption. We discuss the possible explanation for the association of acne lesions and bone deformities based on recent reports of mutations of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 in the great majority of patients with this syndrome, as well as current experimental data on the involvement of the keratinocyte growth factor in the process of hair follicle growth, development, and differentiation.
