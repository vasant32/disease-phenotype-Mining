A normal forehead has two parts, shaped differently: (1) the lower part (corresponding to the supraorbital rim and glabellar area) set at a steep angle to the nose; (2) the upper part, sloping gently backward. To reproduce this normal anatomy in cases of cranostenosis affecting the frontal area, we found it essential to mobilize and reshape a supraorbital bar of bone and to transfer a suitable piece of the cranial vault in one piece to make a new upper forehead. By this method we have treated 18 patients with oxycephaly since 1973, with good results. We have also operated on babies with craniostenosis to try to solve simultaneously the functional and the cosmetic problems. In faciocraniostenosis, there are dominant malformations at the base of the skull, but an isolated frontal advancement of two cm has produced gratifying early results.
