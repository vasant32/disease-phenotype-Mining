An inferior oblique muscle from a patient with Apert's syndrome was examined by light and electron microscopy. Alterations in the muscle fibres, the myoneural junctions, and intramuscular nerves were observed. These data are not compatible with the widespread notion that motility disturbances in this syndrome are solely due to mechanical limitations.
