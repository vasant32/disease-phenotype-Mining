A family with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome with or without polydactyly of the great toes is presented. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome with polydactyly of the great toes has been reported as Robinow-Sorauf syndrome. Both syndromes were observed in this family. This suggests that Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and Robinow-Sorauf syndrome fall within the same clinical spectrum, and the cause is a pleiotropic effect, which is variously expressed.
