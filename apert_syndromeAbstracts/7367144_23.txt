A retrospective  study of 11 instances of idiopathic coronal craniostenosis in otherwise normal children revealed that early lightening, prolonged moderate to severe pelvic discomfort late in pregnancy, and/or an abnormal fetal lie were unusual gestational features indicative of intrauterine constraint for eight of these patients. The impression of unusual constraint in utero was further implied by finding associated positional foot deformities in four of these latter eight children. We hypothesize that prolonged constraint of the fetal head may limit anteroposterior growth stretch at the coronal suture and thereby predispose toward early sutural fusion.
