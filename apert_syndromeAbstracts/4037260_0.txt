Nine children with severe craniofacial malformations underwent eleven major reconstructive craniofacial osteotomies; in two children, cranio-orbito-facial reconstructions were performed. Anaesthesia lasted from seven to eleven hours. The anaesthetic technique consisted of inhalation anaesthetics and supplementation with narcotics. Intraoperative problems were seen mainly regarding the protection of airways, the body temperature, and the extensive blood loss. At the end of anaesthesia all children were awake, three were extubated in the operating room. In children with mid-face advancement the nasotracheal tube was left in place for at least 48 hours.
