A case of difficult intubation in a patient with Apert syndrome, who had recently undergone bilateral internal midface distraction, is described. The 14-year-old boy had no antecedent history of such difficulty, despite numerous previous anaesthetics. We suggest that trismus due to temporalis muscle fibrosis, and the altered relationships of the maxilla and mandible following midface advancement, were causal.
