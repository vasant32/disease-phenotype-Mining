Although great diversity marks the craniosynostoses, our experience related to that from other centers allows us to draw certain conclusions for their management. For the asymmetric synostoses, operative intervention should be carried out in infancy or early childhood. Although the unilateral approach is our preferred method, the bilateral approach can yield equally satisfactory results. Surgeons should, therefore, familiarize themselves with both methods and individualize for the given deformity. Mild symmetric (upper face) synostoses are best managed in infancy or early childhood, utilizing bilateral orbital advancement with the expectation that the need for additional major surgery will be at worst 50 per cent and likely significantly less. For moderate to severe synostoses, delaying major intervention to later childhood or adolescence maximizes the chance of obtaining a satisfactory result by a single procedure, either an extended LeFort III or monoblock advancement. Individualization of each case is essential, and the need for brain and eye protection or the psychologic needs of the patient may dictate a modification of the treatment guidelines. Patients and parents must be aware that growth and development subsequent to surgery is not entirely predictable, and there may be a need for a second major intervention at a subsequent time, despite these established guidelines.
