We report three paediatric cases of severe dehydration and hyponatraemia with circulatory compromise associated with the use of external ventricular drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. Two of the children had cardiac arrests. All were successfully resuscitated. While there were additional factors that contributed to other fluid losses, and fluid balance data are incomplete, these cases highlight a need for increased vigilance when managing children with external ventricular drains.
