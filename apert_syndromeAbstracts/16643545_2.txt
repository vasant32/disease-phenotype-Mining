Apert syndrome is characterized by midface hypoplasia, syndactyly of the hands and feet, proptosis of eyes, steep and flat frontal bones, and premature union of cranial sutures. Maxillary hypoplasia, deep palatal vault, anterior open bite, crowding of the dental arch, severely delayed tooth eruption, and dental malocclusion are the main oral manifestations of this syndrome. In this report, a case of Apert syndrome with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G(6)PD) deficiency is presented. The patient, a 4-year-old male and the fourth child of healthy parents, was admitted to our department because of delayed tooth eruption. He had all the cardinal symptoms of the Apert syndrome. Clinical examination revealed that primary centrals, canines and first molars erupted; however, primary second molars and laterals had not erupted. The patient had no dental caries. Preventive treatments were applied, and subsequently, the patient was taken to long-term follow up.
