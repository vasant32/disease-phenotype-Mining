OBJECTIVE: To understand the molecular pathology of Pfeiffer syndrome. METHODS: DNA from peripheral blood was examined in 4 families with Pfeiffer syndrome by SSCP-sequence analyses and PCR-restriction enzyme digestion. RESULTS: The authors found the mutations of FGFR2 gene in two families, an A to G transition in the 3' acceptor splice site of intron 8 in a family, and Asp321 Ala substitution in exon 9 in another family. In addition, the mutation in exon 5 of FGFR1 gene (Pro252Arg) was found in a family. CONCLUSION: These findings reveal the genetic heterogeneity of Pfeiffer syndrome and can help one understand the molecular mechanism of the disease.
