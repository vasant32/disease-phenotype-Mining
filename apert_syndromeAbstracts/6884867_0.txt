The easily malleable Champy miniplates are suitable for fixation not only in the viscero- but also in the neurocranium in craniofacial surgery of complex craniofacial deformities. The miniplate osteosynthesis stabilizes the skeletal segments in their new position and function so securely that intermaxillary fixation is no longer necessary. This modality of internal fixation is applicable even in small children and infants allowing total osteotomy and mobilisation of the cranium and the facial skeleton at this early age. The miniplates may also prevent restenosis after radical stripping of prematurely closed sutures. The plates and screws are usually removed 6 to 12 months later through small stab incisions. The craniofacial surgery groups in Munich and Innsbruck have successfully applied this form of fixation in 10 selected children with severe malformations, their age ranging from 3 months to 14 years. The technique and results are demonstrated in appropriate examples. The pros and cons of the miniplate osteosynthesis versus other methods of fixation are discussed. During a period of nearly 3 years (1980-1982) no complications have been observed.
