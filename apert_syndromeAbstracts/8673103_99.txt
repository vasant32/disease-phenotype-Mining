Apert syndrome results from one or other of two specific nucleotide substitutions, both C-->G transversions, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene. The frequency of new mutations, estimated as 1 per 65,000 live births, implies germline transversion rates at these two positions are currently the highest known in the human genome. Using a novel application of the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS), we have determined the parental origin of the new mutation in 57 Apert families: in every case, the mutation arose from the father. This identifies the biological basis of the paternal age effect for new mutations previously suggested for this disorder.
