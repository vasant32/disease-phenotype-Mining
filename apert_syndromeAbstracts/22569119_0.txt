Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome that is rarely diagnosed prenatally. It is caused by cytogenetic deletions or mutations of the TWIST1 gene. We report here a de novo prenatal case with clinically and molecularly well defined Saethre-Chotzen syndrome due to a TWIST1 deletion. This is the first reported case of a deletion encompassing the TWIST1 gene to be diagnosed prenatally. We recommend screening for a deletion of the TWIST1 gene if signs of coronal craniosynostosis with no clear etiology are observed on ultrasound examination.
