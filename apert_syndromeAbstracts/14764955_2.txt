 OBJECTIVE: The role of the human fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene family in current prenatal diagnosis and management of craniosynostosis syndromes and skeletal dysplasias is discussed. METHOD: We present the antenatal ultrasound findings, diagnosis, and management of 2 cases of Apert syndrome before and after molecular prenatal diagnosis was available. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Discovery of mutations in FGFR genes now allows the definitive antenatal diagnosis of Apert syndrome, other craniosynostosis syndromes, and skeletal dysplasias.
