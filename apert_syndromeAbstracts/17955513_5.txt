Distal 5q-trisomy has been reported in less than 30 patients, with craniosynostosis present in five. We report two new patients with distal 5q-trisomy craniosynostosis. Patient 1 had mild Kleeblattsch√§del with synostosis of multiple sutures together with wide and medially deviated thumbs and halluces, indicative of Pfeiffer syndrome. Cytogenetic and CGH analyses showed a karyotype of 46,XY,der(10)t(5;10)(q33;q26.3). Patient 2 had a prominent forehead and ridging of the metopic suture. Craniosynostosis of the metopic suture was shown by CT scan. Cytogenetic and CGH analyses disclosed a karyotype of 46,XX,der(17)t(5;17)(q35.1;p13.3). Of the 22 previously reported patients, all had microcephaly and 14 had an abnormal skull shape. Our results support the previous finding that distal 5q-trisomy together with an extra copy of the MSX2 gene leads to abnormal closure of sutures and craniosynostosis.
