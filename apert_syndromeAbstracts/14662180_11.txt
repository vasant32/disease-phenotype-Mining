Although the incidence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea syndrome (OSAS) in craniofacial syndromes is high, it is often not recognized and thus not treated. In order to study the diagnostics and treatment options for these patients, we studied a group of 72 patients treated in our hospital for Apert, Crouzon, or Pfeiffer syndrome, and compared our findings with the literature. There appears to be agreement on polysomnography (PSG) and airway endoscopy as the main diagnostic options, but therapies are very diverse. Early diagnostics and prompt therapy will prevent serious complications.
