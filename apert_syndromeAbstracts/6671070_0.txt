The dermatoglyphic findings in a Cuban family with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome are reported. The family consisted of the parents who were first cousins and their three children. A new classification of zygodactylous patterns was used. Characteristic dermatoglyphic patterns which appeared in these cases were representative of the syndrome. Dermatoglyphics also helped to discover minor expressions of syndactyly and showed that all the members of the family had zygodactylous patterns on palms and soles.
