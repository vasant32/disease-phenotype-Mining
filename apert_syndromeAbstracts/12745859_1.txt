Relapsing idiopathic nodular panniculitis is the term used to describe a group of diseases that presents as subcutaneous inflammatory nodules, fever and systemic symptoms and histopathologically displays inflammation within the fat lobules. There is no specific test for diagnosis and extensive investigations are required to exclude systemic causes of panniculitis. No uniform effective therapy is available and various drugs used include mainly corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Presented in this paper is an intractable case of idiopathic nodular panniculitis whose corticotherapy failed and could not be continued because of serious adverse effects. The rapid and good therapeutic response of the patient to mycophenolate mofetil monotherapy is discussed.
