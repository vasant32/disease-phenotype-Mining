Linkage analysis was performed on a previously reported family in which multiple dominantly inherited acrocephalosyndactyly syndromes were present. An underlying axiom of linkaged analysis is that the trait analysed be monogenic. This prerequisite was presumptively established in the single kindred analysed because acrocephalosyndactyly was observed in multiple cases in multiple generations.
