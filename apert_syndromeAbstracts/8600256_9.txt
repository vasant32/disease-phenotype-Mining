PURPOSE: This article describes the use of stereolithographic (SL) models as an adjunct to treatment planning in patients with Apert's syndrome, scaphocephaly, brachycephaly, and turricephaly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four syndrome patients had computed tomography (CT) scans done presurgically, and one of these patients was additionally scanned postoperatively. SL models and three-dimensional (3D) CT image reconstructions were produced from the CT data, and linear measurements were compared between the two modalities. RESULTS: All cases showed mean differences between measurements with 3D-CT and SL models of -0.3 to 0.8 mm, except on the CT scans with a gantry tilt (-1.7 mm) and the brachycephalic patient in whom larger deviations were demonstrated (-9.5 mm). CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate that the accuracy of the SL technique is not always sufficient, necessitating additional validation studies before it can be recommended for routine clinical use.
