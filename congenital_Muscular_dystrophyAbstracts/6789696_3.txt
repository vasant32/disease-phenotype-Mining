A vertical infection system in hamsters produced by inoculating with Akabane virus was established as an experimental model of congenital muscular dystrophy (Fukuyama type) (FCMD) and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) in humans. Swollen fetuses, mummified fetuses, arthrogryposis and cranial deformities were produced in 13 of 415 newborn hamsters inoculated transplacentally (3.1%). The incidence was significantly higher than that in the control group (p less than 0.05). Eight cases presenting apparent abnormalities were examined histologically and virologically. Pictures of skeletal muscles showing such immature features as chains of internal nuclei and myotubular muscle fibers were demonstrated in all cases. In addition, perivascular infiltration of small round cells and thickening of vascular walls were seen in 5 cases, while myogenic changes such as broken myofibrils, small muscle fibers and changes in fiber size were observed in 6 cases. In the anterior horn of the spinal cord, swelling and loss of nuclei and cell matrices were noticed in 4 cases. In the cerebral cortex, disarrangement of cell layers, edematous changes and loss of nerve cells were revealed in 5 cases. In 4 cases virus particles were found on electron microscopy in the cerebral cortex. The authors considered that this experimental system of intrauterine viral infection would be useful for the etiological study of FCMD and AMC in humans in which not only skeletal muscles but also the central nervous system is affected congenitally.
