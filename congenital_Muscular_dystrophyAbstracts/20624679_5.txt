Mutations in the PLEC1 gene encoding plectin have been reported in neonatal epidermolysis bullosa simplex with muscular dystrophy of later-onset (EBS-MD). A neuromuscular transmission defect has been reported in one previous patient. We report a boy presenting from birth with features of a congenital muscular dystrophy and late-onset myasthenic symptoms. Repetitive nerve stimulation showed significant decrement, and strength improved with pyridostigmine. Subtle blistering noticed only retrospectively prompted further genetic testing, revealing recessive PLEC1 mutations. We conclude that PLEC1 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of congenital muscular dystrophies and myasthenic syndromes, even in the absence of prominent skin involvement.
