Prostaglandin (PG) D(2) exerts pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions under various pathological conditions. We found that the immunoreactivity of hematopoietic PGD synthase (HPGDS) appeared in necrotic muscle fibers, mainly in foci of grouped necrosis, in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) and polymyositis (PM), but not in Becker's muscular dystrophy or in Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy. The HPGDS expression in DMD and PM was observed to be transient in hyalinated fibers at the early necrotic stage but not detected in opaque fibers, in fibers infiltrated by monocytes/lymphocyte, or in regenerating fibers. The immunoreactivities of a cytosolic form of phospholipase A(2) and cyclooxygenase-2, the upstream enzymes of the arachnoid acid cascade, were similarly observed in the HPGDS-positive fibers, suggesting that PGD(2) was produced in situ in those necrotic muscle fibers.
