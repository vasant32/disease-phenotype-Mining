Sixty-two computed tomographic (CT) scans of 36 patients with congenital muscular dystrophy of Fukuyama type (FCMD) were analysed. A low density area in the cerebral white matter was characteristic of FCMD and a special reference was made to the changes in the white matter low density. It was present in 15 patients out of 36 (42%) and frequently seen in the scans obtained on the younger patients; among 11 scans taken of patients between 1 and 2 years of age, 10 scans (91%) showed the white matter low density. Repeated CT scans were carried out on 26 of the 36 cases. Follow-up study revealed that the white matter low density areas were most apparent around the age of one year and decreased or disappeared at 2 or 3 years of age. From these observations, delayed myelination was suspected for the pathogenesis of the low density area found in FCMD.
