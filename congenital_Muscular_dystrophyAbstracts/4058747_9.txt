We used freeze-fracture to study muscle plasma membrane in six patients with Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy and six control children. In the patients, there was significantly fewer intramembranous particles (IMPs) and orthogonal arrays in the P face, with less conspicuous depletion of IMPs in E face. However, the density of caveolae was not affected.
