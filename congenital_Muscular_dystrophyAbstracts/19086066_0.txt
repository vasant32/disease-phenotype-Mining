Deficiency of laminin alpha2 chain leads to a severe form of congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A). Here, we analyzed whether the intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILM) are spared in the dy(3K)/dy(3K) mouse model of complete laminin alpha2 chain absence. No muscle degeneration was evident; expression of various laminin chains was similar to that of limb muscles, and sustained integrin alpha7B expression was noted in laminin alpha2 chain-deficient ILM. We conclude that ILM are spared in MDC1A.
