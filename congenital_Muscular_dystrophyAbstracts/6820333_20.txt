Familial occurrence of cerebral malformations with muscular dystrophy was described by Fukuyama as congenital cerebromuscular dystrophy. We have observed a new syndrome belonging to the same group in three siblings. These syndromes differ in the degree of CNS involvement and abnormalities in the eye. The main clinical characteristics of our cohort were dysmorphic face, hypotonia, areflexia, failure to thrive, corneal opacity, cataract, dysgenesis of the anterior chamber of the eye, and death within the 1st year of life. Hydrocephalus and agyria were verified by computed tomography. Neuropathologic examination demonstrated malformations of the CNS. The agyric hemispheres with polymicrogyria in several cortical segments and severe cortical disorganization in other segments represented the principal anomaly. Congenital muscular dystrophy was also found. The CNS anomalies demonstrated a long-lasting pathologic process extending to involve the eye and muscle, which is most likely an inborn error of metabolism with autosomal recessive inheritance.
