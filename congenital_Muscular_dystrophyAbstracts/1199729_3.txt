This is a report on two autopsy cases of congenital muscular dystrophy associated with micropolygyria. The first case was that of an 11-year-old boy and the other of a 22-year-old male adult. Both cases had similar clinical features, very early onset of disease, diffuse and extensive wasting of skeletal muscles including facial muscles, contracture of joints, hypotonia and mental retardation. In the familial histories of these two cases, the parents of the boy were consanguineous, and a sister of the adult case suffered from muscle weakness and mental retardation. Both of these two cases were clinically diagnosed as congenital cerebromuscular dystrophy (Fukuyama's type). Autopsy revealed marked dystrophy of generalized skeletal muscles and widespread micropolygyria of the brain in both cases. Spinal cords and peripheral nerves were free from any prominent changes. It was concluded that so-called congenital cerebromuscular dystrophy may be caused by myogenic as well as neurogenic abnormalities during fetal period.
