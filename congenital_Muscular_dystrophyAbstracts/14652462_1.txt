We report a rare case of an infant with congenital muscular dystrophy who presented at birth with marked generalized hypotonia and normal mental development. Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level was markedly raised; however no white matter abnormalities were detected by brain imaging techniques. Immunohistochemical staining for merosin (laminin alpha 2) was negative, thereby confirming merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy.
