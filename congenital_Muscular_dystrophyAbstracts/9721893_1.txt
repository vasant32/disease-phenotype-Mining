This is a consecutive study on 28 patients who have been diagnosed as having congenital muscular dystrophy at Jordan University Hospital in the period from January 1990 to February 1997. Of 75 patients diagnosed as having muscle disease, 55 (73.3%) had muscular dystrophy. Of 55 muscular dystrophy patients, 28 (50.9%) had congenital muscular dystrophy, 11 (20%) had Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 9 (16.4%) had Becker muscular dystrophy, 4 (7.3%) had myotonic dystrophy, 2 (3.6%) had limb-girdle dystrophy, and 1 (1.8%) patient had facioscapulohumeral dystrophy. Age of onset of symptoms of congenital muscular dystrophy (hypotonia and weakness) was documented antenatally or in the first few months in the majority (92.9%) of patients. Parental consanguinity was documented in 21 (75%) of congenital muscular dystrophy cases, and family history of possible similar cases in 15 (53.6%). Congenital muscular dystrophy patients with normal cognitive milestones (n = 16; 57.1%) were slightly more common than patients with cognitive delay. In contrast to previous reports, congenital muscular dystrophy is probably more common in communities with high rates of parental consanguinity than other dystrophies. Our study adds significant support to the most recent literature on this finding.
