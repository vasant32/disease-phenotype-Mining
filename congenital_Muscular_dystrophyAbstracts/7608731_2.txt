Central nervous system (CNS) characteristics were examined in seventeen patients with autosomal recessive classic or "pure" congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD). In three patients, neuroradiological examination (CT/MRI) indicated hypodense white matter areas. Two out of these three patients had epilepsy (seizures and epileptic discharges on their EEG). Only two of the remaining patients had epileptic EEG discharges, but without clinical seizures. By comparing our results to data in the literature, we could conclude that the classic or "pure" form of CMD can be subdivided into two subtypes, i.e. those with and those without white matter hypodensities. A mild form of epilepsy or an epileptic predisposition on EEG can be part of the subtype with white matter hypodensities.
