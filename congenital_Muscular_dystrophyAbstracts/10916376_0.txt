We report a pair of siblings with non-Fukuyama type, merosin-positive congenital muscular dystrophy, born to unrelated parents. Patient 1 was a 16-year-old girl with myopathy, cardiomyopathy, severe mental retardation and epilepsy. Patient 2 was a younger brother of patient 1, a 10-year-old boy with myopathy, severe mental retardation and epilepsy. Their serum selenium levels were decreased to 25 micrograms/l and 55 micrograms/l, respectively (normal 97-147 micrograms/l). Their muscle biopsy findings were similar to those seen in selenium deficient myopathy, showing abnormal mitochondrial distribution and giant mitochondria. After oral administration of selenium for 3 months, their gait disturbance apparently improved, which was confirmed by a gait analysis system. Why their gait improved remain unclear, but a defect in selenium metabolism may play a role in the development of congenital muscular dystrophy and mental retardation.
