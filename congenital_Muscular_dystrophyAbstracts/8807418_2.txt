"Classic" congenital muscular dystrophy is a heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized by early-onset muscle weakness and hypotonia, absence of overt cerebral or ocular symptoms, and muscle pathology consistent with a dystrophic process. A subset of patients with congenital muscular dystrophy have recently been found to be deficient in the extracellular matrix protein merosin. Consequently, we reviewed the clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical features of 12 patients (six males and six females) with classic congenital muscular dystrophy who have been seen at the Children's Hospital, Boston, over the past 15 years. There was marked clinical heterogeneity within this patient population, with age of independent ambulation ranging from 13 months to 6 years. Immunocytochemical analysis using antibodies to merosin, dystrophin, 43-kDa dystroglycan, adhalin, and laminin was normal in 11 of 12 patients. One patient had markedly abnormal staining for merosin; the majority of fibers were negative, although occasional fibers demonstrated patchy staining. Immunoblot analysis in this patient demonstrated markedly reduced levels of merosin (< 10% compared to controls and other patient), of apparently normal size. Clinically, this patient could be differentiated from the others by a marked elevation of serum creatine kinase (> 1000 U/L) and the presence of early white-matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging. The results of this study support the observation that abnormalities of merosin are present in a subgroup of patients with classic congenital muscular dystrophy. Although marked elevation of serum creatine kinase and white-matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging may serve to distinguish these patients from other patients with congenital muscular dystrophy, there remains a large proportion of patients in whom the underlying pathogenesis remains to be elucidated.
