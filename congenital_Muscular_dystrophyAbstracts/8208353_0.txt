The sixth child of non-consanguineous parents, who had suffered from severe arthrogryposis syndrome and microcephalia, died at the age of two days. Post-mortem study revealed unique morphological brain anomalies characterized by severe cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, focal cerebral mycrogiria and ectopic masses of immature cells in the periventricular region and cerebral white matter; pachygyria was absent. In addition, muscular examination was consistent with severe muscular dystrophy. These findings suggest that new forms of combined cerebral abnormalities and muscular dystrophy of congenital origin can be recognized in isolated cases.
