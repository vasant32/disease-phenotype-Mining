Progressive muscular dystrophy may produce abnormal reactions to several drugs. There is no consensus of opinion regarding the continuous infusion of propofol in patients with progressive muscular dystrophy. We successfully treated 2 patients with progressive muscular dystrophy who were anesthetized with a continuous infusion of propofol. In case 1, a 19-year-old, 59-kg man with Becker muscular dystrophy and mental retardation was scheduled for dental treatment under general anesthesia. General anesthesia was maintained by a continuous infusion of 6-10 mg/kg propofol per hour and an inhalational mixture of 67% nitrous oxide and 33% oxygen. No complications were observed during or after the operation. In case 2, a 5-year-old, 11-kg boy with Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy and slight mental retardation was scheduled for dental treatment under general anesthesia. General anesthesia was maintained with a continuous infusion of 6-12 mg/kg propofol per hour and an inhalational mixture of 0.5-1.5% sevoflurane in 67% nitrous oxide and 33% oxygen. No complications were observed during or after the operation. It is speculated that a continuous infusion of propofol in progressive muscular dystrophy does not cause malignant hyperthermia because serum levels of creatine phosphokinase and myoglobin decreased after our anesthetic management. Furthermore, our observations suggest that sevoflurane may have some advantages in patients with progressive type muscular dystrophies other than Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy. In conclusion, our cases suggest that a continuous infusion of propofol for the patients with progressive muscular dystrophy is a safe component of our anesthetic strategy.
