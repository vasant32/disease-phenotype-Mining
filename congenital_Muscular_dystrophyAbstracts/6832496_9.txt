Three children, two siblings and one unrelated child, with congenital muscular dystrophy with central nervous system (CNS) involvement are discussed. The siblings appeared to suffer from a relatively mild myopathy with progressive brain disease, of which brain biopsy in one showed astrocytic proliferation in the white matter. In the patient with severe muscle disease, autopsy showed widespread patchy demyelination in the white matter and developmental abnormalities in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex. These patients differ from the Japanese (Fukuyama) cases of CMD in the severity of the changes in the cerebral white matter, and from Santavuori's cases in the absence of ocular abnormalities and hydrocephalus. Their unique nosology is discussed.
