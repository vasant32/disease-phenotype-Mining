Characterized by proximal muscle weakness and wasting, limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are a heterogeneous group of clinical disorders. Previous reports have documented either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive modes of inheritance, with genetic linkage studies providing evidence for the existence of at least 12 distinct loci. Gene products have been identified for five genes responsible for autosomal recessive forms of the disorder. We performed a genome scan using pooled DNA from a large Hutterite kindred in which the affected members display a mild form of autosomal recessive LGMD. A total of 200 markers were used to screen pools of DNA from patients and their siblings. Linkage between the LGMD locus and D9S302 (maximum LOD score 5.99 at recombination fraction .03) was established. Since this marker resides within the chromosomal region known to harbor the gene causing Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), we expanded our investigations, to include additional markers in chromosome region 9q31-q34.1. Haplotype analysis revealed five recombinations that place the LGMD locus distal to the FCMD locus. The LGMD locus maps close to D9S934 (maximum multipoint LOD score 7.61) in a region that is estimated to be approximately 4.4 Mb (Genetic Location Database composite map). On the basis of an inferred ancestral recombination, the gene may lie in a 300-kb region between D9S302 and D9S934. Our results provide compelling evidence that yet another gene is involved in LGMD; we suggest that it be named "LGMD2H."
