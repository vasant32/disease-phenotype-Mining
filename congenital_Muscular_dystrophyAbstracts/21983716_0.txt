 OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical feature of a Chinese family with muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) and the mutation of protein O-linked-mannose beta-1, 2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 gene (POMGNT1). METHODS: Clinical data of the proband and his family members were collected. Genomic DNA from the patient and his parents was extracted using standard procedures from the peripheral blood leukocytes. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA direct sequencing were employed to analyze all of the exons to determine the mutation, and the relationship between genotype and phenotype was analyzed. RESULTS: The proband was diagnosed as floppy baby, presented with delayed psychomotor development and myopathic face. His serum creatine kinase (CK) level elevated moderately and brain MRI showed cerebral and cerebellar gyrus abnormalities with white matter signal intensity changes, cerebellar cysts and cerebellar and brain stem hypoplasia, consistent with congenital muscular dystrophy with eye brain disorder. Further test with DNA detected a compound heterozygous mutation of c.1896 1 G to C before exon 22 which may induce splicing error, and missense mutation c.1319T to G, p.L440R in exon 16. Both parents had a heterozygous mutation at the mutation sites. CONCLUSION: According to our study, the family is diagnosed as MEB. The proband carried compound heterozygous mutations in the POMGNT1 gene, and his parents are heterozygous carriers, which is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. The child is definitely diagnosed as having muscle eye brain disease.
