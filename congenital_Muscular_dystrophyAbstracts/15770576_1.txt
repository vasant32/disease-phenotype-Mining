Three rare autosomal recessive disorders share the combination of congenital muscular dystrophy and brain malformations including a neuronal migration defect: muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD). In addition, ocular abnormalities are a constant feature in MEB and WWS. We report on two brothers with MEB. The clinical and radiological characteristics are demonstrated.
