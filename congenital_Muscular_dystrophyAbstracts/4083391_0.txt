When compared with an age-matched normal control and a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) case, the patient with FCMD had an unusual ganglioside pattern in the cerebral gray matter. The total level of lipid-bound sialic acid in the cerebral gray matter was also slightly decreased. However, other lipid compositions of the cerebral gray and white matter were normal compared with those in the control case.
