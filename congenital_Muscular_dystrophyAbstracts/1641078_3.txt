We have evaluated the CNS findings of 30 patients with congenital muscular dystrophy and normal mental development. The intelligence was estimated by psychological testing or school performance. There were more children of above average intelligence than expected. Neuroradiological examination was done to 15/17 patients still alive. White matter changes were seen in five and cerebral atrophy in four patients. Three patients had epilepsy, two mild, one drug resistant. The EEG did not reveal any common pattern, though there were various abnormalities in several children.
