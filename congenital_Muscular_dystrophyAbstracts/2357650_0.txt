Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) is a heterogeneous group of disorders which is associated with more or less degrees of cerebral involvement. There are four separate entities within CMD nosology. Among these Fukuyama's CMD (FCMD) is highly prevalent in Japan, whereas the classic form with normal or subnormal intelligence, also known as the occidental type, covers the vast majority of cases in the West. We report a case of FCMD seen in a Turkish child.
