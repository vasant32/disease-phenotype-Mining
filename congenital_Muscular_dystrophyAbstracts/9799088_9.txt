Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) is an autosomal recessive, severe muscular dystrophy associated with brain anomalies. After our initial mapping of the FCMD locus to 9q31-33, we performed linkage disequilibrium analysis, which led us to suspect that the FCMD gene lay within a region of less than 100 kb containing D9S2107. In the present study, we developed two new microsatellites (D9S2170 and D9S2171) in close vicinity to D9S2107 and examined haplotypes of FCMD chromosomes by using four markers (cen-D9S2105-D9S2170-D9S2171-D9S2107-tel). As 82% of the FCMD chromosomes that we examined shared the founder haplotype (138-192-147-183) and 94% of the FCMD patients in our panel carried founder haplotypes on one or both chromosomes, the data supported the hypothesis of a single founder of this disease in the Japanese population. Eight haplotypes different from the founder's were observed in FCMD chromosomes, indicating that eight different FCMD mutations in addition to the founder's have occurred in Japan. Moreover, we have detected several historical recombinations that have disrupted the founder haplotype at D9S2105 or D9S2170 and conclude that the FCMD gene is probably located just centromeric to D9S2170.
