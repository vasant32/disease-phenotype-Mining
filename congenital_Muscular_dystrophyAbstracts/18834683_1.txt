Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), and muscle-eye-brain (MEB) disease are clinically similar autosomal recessive disorders characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy, cobblestone lissencephaly, and eye anomalies. Among them, WWS is the most severe syndrome. Causative genes for FCMD (Fukutin), WWS (POMT1), and MEB (POMGnT1) have been identified. The vast majority of Japanese FCMD patients carry at least one copy of an ancestral founder insertion mutation. Patients homozygous for this insertion show a milder phenotype than do compound heterozygotes, carrying the insertion in combination with a missense or nonsense mutation on the other allele. No Japanese FCMD patients have been identified with nonfounder mutations on both alleles. A Turkish boy with characteristics of WWS was detected to have a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 5 of Fukutin. This is the first case worldwide in which a Fukutin mutation has been found outside the Japanese population. Later, another Turkish boy with WWS phenotype was found to have a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 4 of Fukutin. These two Turkish boys represent the most severe end of the phenotypic spectrum of Fukutin mutations. The Japanese FCMD patients carrying at least one copy of a founder mutation in the noncoding region may produce a lower level of mature Fukutin than normal and generate a relatively mild FCMD phenotype. The homozygous nonsense mutations within the coding region identified in Turkish patients are predicted to cause a total loss of fukutin activity and are likely to produce a more severe phenotype which closely resembles WWS.
