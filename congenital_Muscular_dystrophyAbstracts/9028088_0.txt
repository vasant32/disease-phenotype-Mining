Non-Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy (n-FCMD), a subtype of progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD), is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder. N-FCMD is characterized by severe and progressive motor weakness and atrophies of proximal muscles during the infant period. A 9-year-old boy with n-FCMD underwent elective surgery for muscle release around the hip joints bilaterally. As many perioperative complications related with volatile anesthetics and muscle relaxants had been reported in the anesthetic management of PMD, these drugs were thought to be contraindicated in patients with n-FCMD. Because n-FCMD seemed to have very similar pathogenesis with PMD, caudal epidural block was chosen, supplemented with the administration of diazepam, pentazocine and nitrous oxide. The operation and anesthesia were conducted uneventfully. No complications occurred postoperatively.
