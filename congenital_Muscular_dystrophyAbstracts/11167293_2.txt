PURPOSE: To describe a child with Muscle-Eye-Brain disease (MEB), one of three types of congenital muscular dystrophy associated with ocular abnormalities. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: The child showed severe visual impairment due to progressive myopia and retinal degeneration, a pachygyria-type of migration disorder of the brain with a nodular cortical surface, i.e. cobblestone cortex, as well as muscular weakness and severe mental retardation. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmological assessments are important to help to diagnose and follow children with congenital muscular dystrophy.
