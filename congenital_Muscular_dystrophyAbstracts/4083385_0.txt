A girl with congenital muscular dystrophy with severe scoliosis from birth was presented. No positive family history was obtainable. She developed muscle hypotonia and weakness, and feeding difficulty during the neonatal period. Her developmental milestones were delayed; she learned to walk at the age of 2 years when she walked with a "waddling gait" and stood up with Gowers' maneuver. On physical examination at 2 years old, she had mild proximal dominant muscle weakness and atrophy, and severe scoliosis with a Cobb's angle of 74 degrees but no joint contractures in the extremities. Creatine kinase was slightly elevated. Biopsied muscle showed myopathic changes, including variation in fiber size, moderate fibrous tissue proliferation, some necrotic and regenerating fibers and type 1 fiber predominance, consistent with those seen in chronic progressive muscular dystrophy.
