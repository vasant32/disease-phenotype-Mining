We report on a patient affected by congenital muscular dystrophy, severe psychomotor retardation, severe hypotonia, papillar hypoplasia and peculiar NMR pattern of hydrocephalus, Dandy-Walker malformation and leukodystrophy. These findings are intermediate between Walker-Walburg syndrome, Fukuyama disease and Occidental congenital muscular dystrophy. Our case focuses on the wide spectrum of congenital muscle dystrophy associated with central nervous system disease and on the difficulties of genetic counseling in these families.
