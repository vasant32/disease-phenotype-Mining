Mitophagy, selective autophagy of mitochondria, has been extensively demonstrated in cultured cell models but has never been described in skeletal muscle in the context of muscle disease. We recently reported the first example of human muscle disease where mitophagy plays a role in the peculiar muscle pathology. This disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CHKB gene encoding choline kinase Î². "Patients" and rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy (rmd) mice, spontaneous Chkb mutants, develop congenital muscular dystrophy with a peculiar mitochondrial abnormality--mitochondria are markedly enlarged at the periphery of muscle fibers and absent from the center. Choline kinase is the first enzymatic step in a biosynthetic pathway for phosphatidylcholine, the most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotes. Our discovery demonstrates that a phosphatydilcholine biosynthetic defect leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased mitophagy.
