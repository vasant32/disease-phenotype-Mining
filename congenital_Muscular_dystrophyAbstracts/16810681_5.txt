Biglycan is an extracellular ligand for the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) that is upregulated in both dystrophic and regenerating muscle. Biglycan also binds to collagen VI, mutations of which cause a congenital muscular dystrophy (Ullrich's; UCMD) that is also characterized by connective tissue abnormalities. The expression of biglycan in early development and postnatal ages has not been well characterized. Here we show that biglycan transcript levels peak at approximately 21 weeks' gestation in human fetal muscle. Immunocytochemical analysis of developing mouse muscle shows that biglycan can be detected in muscle as early as embryonic day (E)16 and is most abundant between postnatal day (P)1 and P7. Biglycan is also highly expressed in developing tendon, with maximal levels observed at E16-18. This robust tendon expression is correlated with a sharp peak in biglycan transcript levels in the hindlimb. Finally, at E18 collagen VI colocalizes with biglycan in tendon. These results suggest that biglycan has a particularly important function during muscle and connective tissue development. Moreover, biglycan may play a role in the pathogenesis of collagen VI-associated congenital muscular dystrophies.
