Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) composes a group of disorders characterized by hypotonia and muscular weakness noticed in the first year of life. The Ullrich's form is characterized by proximal joint contractures and distal hiperextensibility. About 40% of these patients present mutations in one of the genes that codify the sub-units of the collagen VI protein (COL6), producing total or partial deficiency of the protein expression. We analyzed, through immunohistochemistry, the expression of COL6 in muscle fragments of 50 patients with CMD; 20 of them presented merosin expression deficiency. We identified 4 cases with total COL6 deficiency (8% of the total), representing 13% of the cases with normal merosin expression. The histological findings of patients with deficiency of COL6 were indistinguishable from other forms of CMD, but milder than that abnormalities observed in merosin deficient patients. In three COL6 deficient patients were observed hypotonia and weakness in the neonatal period, delayed of motor milestones, muscular retractions of knees and elbows, distal joint hiperextensibility and congenital hip dislocation (two patients). One patient lost the ability to walk; and one died due to respiratory problems. The analysis of COL6 expression, as well as merosin expression, in the muscle tissue from CMD patients, can be important for identification and phenotypic characterization of different CMD subtypes.
