Using three different analyses, we investigated the levels of the three small stress proteins alphaB crystallin, HSP 27 and p20 in the slow-twitch soleus muscle and fast-twitch tibialis anterior muscle of normal and dy mice. All of these analyses (immunoassay, Western blot and immunohistochemistry) showed markedly increased levels of these stress proteins in fast-twitch type muscle (tibialis anterior muscle) of dy mouse. In contrast, the levels of alphaB crystallin, HSP 27 and p20 of dy mouse were reduced in slow-twitch type muscle (soleus muscle). Manipulation of this protective response may reduce injury and may have potential therapeutic application in congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), which possesses a deficiency of laminin-alpha2 chain in muscle fiber basement similar to dy mouse.
