Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), the second most common childhood muscular dystrophy in Japan, is caused by alterations in the fukutin gene. Mutations in fukutin cause abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a cell surface laminin receptor; however, the exact function and pathophysiological role of fukutin are unclear. Although the most prevalent mutation in Japan is a founder retrotransposal insertion, point mutations leading to abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan have been reported, both in Japan and elsewhere. To understand better the molecular pathogenesis of fukutin-deficient muscular dystrophies, we constructed 13 disease-causing missense fukutin mutations and examined their pathological impact on cellular localization and α-dystroglycan glycosylation. When expressed in C2C12 myoblast cells, wild-type fukutin localizes to the Golgi apparatus, whereas the missense mutants A170E, H172R, H186R, and Y371C instead accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum. Protein O-mannose β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1) also mislocalizes when co-expressed with these missense mutants. The results of nocodazole and brefeldin A experiments suggested that these mutant proteins were not transported to the Golgi via the anterograde pathway. Furthermore, we found that low temperature culture or curcumin treatment corrected the subcellular location of these missense mutants. Expression studies using fukutin-null mouse embryonic stem cells showed that the activity responsible for generating the laminin-binding glycan of α-dystroglycan was retained in these mutants. Together, our results suggest that some disease-causing missense mutations cause abnormal folding and localization of fukutin protein, and therefore we propose that folding amelioration directed at correcting the cellular localization may provide a therapeutic benefit to glycosylation-deficient muscular dystrophies.
