We report a patient harboring a novel homozygous mutation of c.604T>G (p.F202V) in POMT2. He showed delayed psychomotor development but acquired the ability to walk at the age of 3 years and 10 months. His brain MRI was normal. No ocular abnormalities were seen. Biopsied skeletal muscle revealed markedly decreased but still detectable glycosylated forms of alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG). Our results indicate that mutations in POMT2 can cause a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes as observed in other genes associated with alpha-dystroglycanopathy. Presence of small amounts of partly glycosylated alpha-DG may have a role in reducing the clinical symptoms of alpha-dystroglycanopathy.
