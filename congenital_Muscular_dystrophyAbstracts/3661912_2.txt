A 9-year-old Japanese boy with congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) with normal intelligence was presented. He was extremely floppy and had joint contractures since birth. Motor milestones were delayed and he did not learn to walk alone. Intellectual development was normal and no convulsions were observed. On physical examination at 9 years old, he had diffuse muscle weakness and atrophy and flexion contractures of joints. Creatine kinase was normal and IQ was 95. Biopsied muscle showed myopathic changes consistent with muscular dystrophy. CT scans of the head revealed diffuse low density area in the white matter of the cerebrum. These findings suggest central nervous system involvement in CMD is not confined to Fukuyama-type CMD.
