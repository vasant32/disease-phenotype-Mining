The authors report a family in whom three members suffered from congenital hydrocephalus and ocular abnormalities. One of these patients showed along with these symptoms congenital muscular dystrophy. In this child, autopsy disclosed severe cerebral malformations consisting of lissencephaly, arhinencephaly, stenosis of aqueduct, Dandy-Walker cyst and cerebellar micropolygyria. The mode of transmission, the eyes abnormalities and the neuropathological findings of this family resemble the clinical and pathological aspects of Warburg syndrome. However, the presence of congenital muscle dystrophy in one of these children suggests some links with Fukuyama's congenital muscular dystrophy and/or with so-called brain-eye-muscle disease of Santavuori. These three syndromes are shortly discussed. The present case and few others reported in the literature obviously represent a severe and lethal form of a congenital disease involving brain, muscle and eyes.
