Two mutational mechanisms are known to underlie Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD): heterozygous dominant negatively-acting mutations and recessively-acting loss-of-function mutations. We describe large genomic deletions on chromosome 21q22.3 as a novel type of mutation underlying recessively inherited UCMD in 2 families. Clinically unaffected parents carrying large genomic deletions of COL6A1and COL6A2also provide conclusive evidence that haploinsufficiency for COL6A1and COL6A2is not a disease mechanism for Bethlem myopathy. Our findings have important implications for the genetic evaluation of patients with collagen VI-related myopathies as well as for potential therapeutic interventions for this patient population.
