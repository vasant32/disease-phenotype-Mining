Muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) is an autosomal recessive congenital muscular dystrophy with ocular abnormalities and type II lissencephaly. MEB is caused by mutations in the protein O-linked mannose beta1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (POMGnT1) gene on chromosome 1q33. POMGnT1 is a glycosylation enzyme that participates in the synthesis of O-mannosyl glycan. The disease is characterized by altered glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. The clinical spectrum of MEB phenotype and POMGnT1 mutations are significantly expanded. We would like to present two cases with MEB disease with POMGnT1 mutations, whose clinical picture shows heterogeneity. The patient with R442H mutation had the classical form of the disease although the one with IVS17-2A-->G homozygous mutation had severe autistic features as the dominating presenting sign. These two cases represent different spectrums of one disorder. To the best of our knowledge, autistic features and stereotypical movements have not been included thus far as a part of broad and heterogeneous MEB spectrum.
