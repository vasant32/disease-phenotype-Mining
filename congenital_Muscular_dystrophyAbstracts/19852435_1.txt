The Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cranial, cerebellar and ocular malformations and congenital muscular dystrophy. Hyperekplexia is characterized by transient, generalized rigidity in response to unexpected loud noises or sudden tactile stimulation. Herein, we report an infant who had typical clinical features of FCMD with hyperekplexia. Our purpose is to draw attention to this first report of concomitant FCMD and hyperekplexia.
