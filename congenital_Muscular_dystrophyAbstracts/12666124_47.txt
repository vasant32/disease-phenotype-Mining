We describe 22 patients with mutations in the fukutin-related protein (FKPR) gene. Four patients had congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1C), with presentation at birth, severe weakness and inability to stand unsupported. The other 18 had limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2I). Eleven showed a Duchenne-like course with loss of ambulation in the early teens while 7 had a milder phenotype. Muscle biopsy invariably showed abnormal expression of a-dystroglycan. MDC1C patients either carried 2 missense or 1 missense and 1 nonsense mutations. Patients with LGMD2I shared a common mutation (C826A,Leu276Ileu) and their phenotypic severity was correlated with the second allelic mutation.
