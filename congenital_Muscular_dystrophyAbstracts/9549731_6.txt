Laminin alpha 2, a sub-unit of the basement membrane component laminin-2, is deficient in the dy/dy and allelic dy2 J/dy2 J mouse. It is also the defective protein in a proportion of children with congenital muscular dystrophy. Linkage and mutational analysis have established that this is a primary effect caused by defects in the LAMA2 gene. Laminin alpha 2 has previously been shown to be deficient in dy/dy skeletal muscle, peripheral nervous system and brain. We report here preliminary observations on differences in detection of laminin alpha 2 in muscle, peripheral nerves and brain of dy/dy mice using three, well characterized antibodies. In normal muscle laminin alpha 2 is localized to the basement membrane of the myofibres and the Schwann cells of peripheral nerves, whilst in adult brain it is only detected on blood vessels. Our results show that there is appreciable, but slightly reduced, expression of laminin alpha 2 in skeletal muscle of dy/dy mice but almost no detectable protein in the brain, peripheral nerve and spinal nerve roots. Our observations are at present unexplained but they raise the possibility for the first time that there may be different tissue specific isoforms of laminin alpha 2. Molecular characterization of possible differences responsible for our observations may aid the identification of the mutation in the dy/dy mouse and lead to a better understanding of the role and expression of laminin alpha 2 in pathological conditions.
