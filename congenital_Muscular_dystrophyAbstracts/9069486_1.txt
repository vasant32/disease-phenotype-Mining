Two siblings with a congenital muscular dystrophy and severe mental retardation which was not due to dystrophin, merosin, or adhalin deficiency are described. These cases overlap with congenital muscular dystrophy of the Fukuyama-type but are less severe. Atypical features include limited facial involvement, retained ambulation, and severe retrocollis.
