Walker-Warburg syndrome is a lethal autosomal recessive disorder characterized by anomalies of the central nervous system and the eye. Recently, elevation of muscle enzymes and congenital muscular dystrophy have been found to contribute to the diagnosis of this syndrome. The authors studied two pairs of siblings with Walker-Warburg syndrome, offspring of consanguineous parents from two unrelated families. The patients had hydrocephalus, congenital glaucoma, elevated muscle enzymes, and hypotonicity. The histologic and ultrastructural muscular changes were consistent with congenital muscular dystrophy.
