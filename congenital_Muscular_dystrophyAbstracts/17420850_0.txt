Congenital muscle dystrophy (CMD) is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive myopathies. It is known that CMD may affect the central nervous system (CNS). Some authors have shown that merosin-negative CMD patients may have encephalic metabolic disturbances. In order to study metabolic changes within the brain, the authors performed a magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study in a 1-year-old girl with merosin-positive CMD (MP-CMD). MRS of brain demonstrated that NAA/Cr ratio was decreased (1.52), while Cho/Cr ratio was increased (1.78). These findings suggest that metabolic changes in CNS can also be found in patients with MP-CMD.
