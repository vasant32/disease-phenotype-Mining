Abnormalities of the proteins constituting the extracellular matrix have been shown to play important roles in the molecular pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies. In the present study, we have established a monoclonal antibody against a human skeletal muscle extracellular matrix protein. The antibody M1 recognized a single 180-kDa protein (p180) by immunoblot analysis of normal human skeletal muscle and gave a strong and continuous signal along the sarcolemma by immunohistochemical analysis. Furthermore, p180 could be solubilized either under a strong alkaline condition, or in the presence of EDTA or detergents such as Triton X-100, indicating that p180 was an extracellular matrix protein. Interestingly, p180 was deficient in the skeletal muscle of the patients with Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), but not other muscular diseases, by both immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses. We presume that the deficiency of p180 in FCMD is caused specifically by the primary deficiency of fukutin, the causative protein of FCMD, and plays an important role in muscle cell degeneration in this disease.
