The evidence of severe structural brain abnormalities in association with severe mental retardation is characteristic in congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) forms other than the 'classical' form. However, it seems that the nosology of CMD is not complete yet, as we have clinical, immunohistochemical and genetic data suggesting that there are other unclassified forms. Here we report two CMD siblings from a consanguineous family with partial merosin-deficiency in muscle biopsies, severe mental retardation and normal MRI of the brain. The disease was not linked to the LAMA2 gene (6q22-23) or to Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) (9q31-33). To our knowledge, such an association may constitute a new entity within the broad clinical spectrum of CMD.
