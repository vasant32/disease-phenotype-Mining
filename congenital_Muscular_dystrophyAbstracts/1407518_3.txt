Serial MRI of the brain of a female infant with Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) is presented. Initial MRI revealed diffuse abnormal signal in the cerebral white matter extending peripherally. On follow-up studies, the abnormal signals disappeared or decreased from the posterior to anterior, and from central to peripheral. These changes in signal intensity correlate well with the process of myelination as demonstrated in histochemical studies. It appears that the abnormal signals in FCMD are caused by delayed myelination. When abnormal signal intensity is seen in the cerebral white matter of a developmentally delayed infant, serial MRI may be used to follow the course of the illness.
