We report the case of an infant with facial dysmorphism, congenital hydrocephalus, severe hypotonia and absence of psychomotor development, with ocular and cerebral malformations consistent with the diagnosis of Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS). Investigations included a cerebral CT scan indicative of type II lissencephaly and a muscular biopsy which showed findings of muscular dystrophy. The association of hypotonia, developmental delay and seizures with a neuronal migration disturbance and retinal involvement raised the suspicion of a peroxisomal disorder. The pertinent biochemical investigations, however, were negative. The features of this syndrome are reviewed, emphasizing the similarities with other related disorders as cerebro-oculo-muscular syndrome. We suggest that muscle involvement should be investigated in every case of WWS.
