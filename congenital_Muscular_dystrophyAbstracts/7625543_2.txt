The corpus callosum (CC) of 24 Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) patients were studied using midsagittal MRI and the results were compared with those of 20 age-matched controls. The measurements included the thickness of the genu, body and splenium; the length, height and five specific angles of the CC. The cephalic index was also measured on axial MRI. The correlations among CC length, CC height, the five angles and the cephalic index were evaluated. One case of FCMD was found to have CC agenesis. The thickness of the genu, body, splenium and CC length were significantly reduced in FCMD. In addition, in FCMD, the CC height was increased, angle alpha was greater, angle delta reduced and the CC configuration more rounded, showing a high arch on imaging. No significant correlations among CC length, CC height, the five specific angles and the cephalic index were found in any of the FCMD data. These observations demonstrated the fact that CC development in FCMD is uniquely abnormal, and abnormal CC configuration does not have any correlation with altered cephalic index.
