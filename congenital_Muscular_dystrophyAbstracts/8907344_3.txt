We report clinical and pathological findings in 9 children affected by congenital muscular dystrophy with normal or borderline intelligence and hypodensity of cerebral white matter (CMD-HWM), also frequently called 'occidental or western form of cerebro-muscular dystrophy' (OCMD). Our patients have uniform, distinct, clinical presentation that includes: normal or subnormal intelligence, severe, slowly progressive motor disability, high rate of facial involvement and dysmorphic aspect, increased creatine kinase levels and variable degrees of abnormal, radiographic, cerebral white matter pattern. By comparing our cases with previous reports we suggest that this subtype of CMD is not uncommon in Brazil and it is represented by a particularly severe and homogeneous clinical picture with important motor disability. The immunohistochemical staining for merosin, performed on the muscle biopsy of 6 among 9 patients, showed that all are merosin negative.
