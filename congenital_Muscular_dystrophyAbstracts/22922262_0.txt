Dystroglycan is a prominent cell surface protein that mediates attachment to the extracellular matrix. Although broadly expressed, glycosylated dystroglycan is critically important for muscle cell adherence to its surrounding matrix. A subgroup of muscular dystrophies, which often manifest in infancy, is associated with reduced glycosylation of dystroglycan. In this issue of the JCI, Beedle et al. used conditional gene targeting of Fktn, the gene responsible for Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, to investigate a developmental requirement for glycosylation of dystroglycan.
