Three children with a diagnosis of congenital muscular dystrophy are described. Because of the heterogeneity of these disorders the authors stress the necessity of differentiation with other causes of "floppy infant" syndrome, especially with Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, structural myopathies, and Duchenne progressive muscular dystrophy. An extensive hypodense area on brain CT scan was found in one child.
