 BACKGROUND: Three rare autosomal recessive disorders share the combination of congenital muscular dystrophy and brain malformations including a neuronal migration defect: muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD). In addition, ocular abnormalities are a constant feature in MEB and WWS. Lack of consistent ocular abnormalities in FCMD has allowed a clear clinical demarcation of this syndrome, whereas the phenotypic distinction between MEB and WWS has remained controversial. The MEB gene is located on chromosome 1p32-p34. OBJECTIVES: To establish distinguishing diagnostic criteria for MEB and WWS and to determine whether MEB and WWS are allelic disorders. METHODS: The authors undertook clinical characterization followed by linkage analysis in 19 MEB/WWS families with 29 affected individuals. With use of clinical diagnostic criteria based on Finnish patients with MEB, each patient was categorized as having either MEB or WWS. A linkage and haplotype analysis using 10 markers spanning the MEB locus was performed on the entire family resource. RESULTS: Patients in 11 families were classified as having MEB and in 8 families as WWS. Strong evidence in favor of genetic heterogeneity was obtained in the 19 families. There was evidence for linkage to 1p32-p34 in all but 1 of the 11 pedigrees segregating the MEB phenotype. In contrast, linkage to the MEB locus was excluded in seven of eight of the WWS families. CONCLUSION: These results allow the classification of MEB and WWS as distinct disorders on both clinical and genetic grounds and provide a basis for the mapping of the WWS gene(s).
