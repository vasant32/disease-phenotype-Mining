The authors report a case of congenital muscular dystrophy with mild nonprogressive muscle weakness, white matter hypodensity, and absence of the laminin alpha2 chain in muscle fibers with two antibodies, but not with four others. They identified mutations in LAMA2, which explain the partial laminin alpha2 deficiency. Analysis of this case and two others allows us to refine the epitopes of two of the commercial antibodies, and illustrate the importance of using antibodies directed against different domains of the protein.
