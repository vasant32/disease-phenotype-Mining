Twelve girls and 2 boys with severe but not congenital muscular dystrophy were found in a national survey. An autosomal recessive gene is likely to account for most if not all of these cases. The condition differs slightly from X-linked Duchenne muscular dystrophy in showing prominent early toe-walking, a milder course, relatively more weakness of the deltoid muscles, normal intelligence, a normal ECG and a more focal pattern of muscle pathology.
