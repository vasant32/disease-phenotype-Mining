We report 5 cases (2 familial and 3 sporadic) who share a diagnosis of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) in association with short stature, proximal contractures, rigidity of the spine and distal joint laxity as well as early respiratory failure and mild to moderate mental retardation. The expression of collagen VI was confirmed to be normal on muscle biopsies of all 5 patients and in the informative family linkage to any of the three COL6 A loci was excluded. These findings extend the phenotypes within the CMD classification.
