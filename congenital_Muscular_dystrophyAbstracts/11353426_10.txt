To investigate whether there are any basic abnormalities of coagulation and fibrinolysis in muscular dystrophy, we measured serum levels of the MM isozyme of creatine kinase (CK-MM), fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), plasma levels of fibrinogen, antithrombin (AT), and D-dimer in 36 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), 11 with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), 5 with Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), 5 with myotonic dystrophy (MyD), and 5 with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2. FDP levels were elevated in the patients with DMD, BMD, and FCMD (1.0 to 84.9 microg/ml), but not in the patients with MyD and SMA type 2. In DMD, BMD, and FCMD, FDP levels significantly correlated with CK-MM, but not with age, fibrinogen, AT, D-dimer, and type of dystrophy (multiple regression analysis; r(2) = 0.814, P < 0.0001). These findings suggested that enhanced coagulation and fibrinolysis are associated with muscle degeneration in patients with DMD, BMD, and FCMD.
