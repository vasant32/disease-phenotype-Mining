Using specific monoclonal antibodies against different subunits of laminin, we studied the differential distribution pattern of several laminin chains in the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system. Laminin chains alpha 1, beta 1 and gamma 1, were found in the basement membrane (BM) of blood vessels in both CNS and PNS. In contrast, laminin alpha 2 though present in the BM of capillaries in the CNS, was completely absent from PNS capillaries. Laminins alpha 2, beta 1, gamma 1 could be detected in peripheral nerve, in the BM of Schwann cells, which did not contain Laminin alpha 1. The possible importance of laminin alpha 2 for myelination in the PNS as well as in the function of the blood-brain barrier in the CNS, and its potential relevance to the pathology of congenital muscular dystrophy associated with deficiency of this laminin chain, is discussed.
