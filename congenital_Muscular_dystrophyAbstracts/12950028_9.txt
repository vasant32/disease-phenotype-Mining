This study has examined the immunological localization of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A, PDGF-B, and PDGF receptor (PDGFR) alpha and beta to clarify their role in the progression of muscular dystrophy. Biopsied frozen muscles from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) were analysed immunohistochemically using antibodies raised against PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and PDGFR alpha and beta. Muscles from two dystrophic mouse models (dy and mdx mice) were also immunostained with antibodies raised against PDGFR alpha and beta. In normal human control muscle, neuromuscular junctions and vessels were positively stained with antibodies against PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGFR alpha and PDGFR beta. In human dystrophic muscles, PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGFR alpha and PDGFR beta were strongly immunolocalized in regenerating muscle fibres and infiltrating macrophages. PDGFR alpha was also immunolocalized to the muscle fibre sarcolemma and necrotic fibres. The most significant finding in this study was a remarkable overexpression of PDGFR beta and, to a lesser extent, PDGFR alpha in the endomysium of DMD and CMD muscles. PDGFR was also overexpressed in the interstitium of muscles from dystrophic mice, particularly dy mice. Double immunolabelling revealed that activated interstitial fibroblasts were clearly positive for PDGFR alpha and beta. However, DMD and CMD muscles with advanced fibrosis showed very poor reactivity against PDGF and PDGFR. Those findings were confirmed by immunoblotting with PDGFR beta. These findings indicate that PDGF and its receptors are significantly involved in the active stage of tissue destruction and are associated with the initiation or promotion of muscle fibrosis. They also have roles in muscle fibre regeneration and signalling at neuromuscular junctions in both normal and diseased muscle.
