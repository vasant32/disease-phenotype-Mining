Dropped head syndrome is characterized by severe weakness of neck extensor muscles with sparing of the flexors. It is a prominent sign in several neuromuscular conditions, but it may also be an isolated feature with uncertain aetiology. We report two children in whom prominent weakness of neck extensor muscles is associated with mutations in lamin A/C (LMNA) and selenoprotein N1 (SEPN1) genes, respectively. This report expands the underlying causes of the dropped head syndrome which may be the presenting feature of a congenital muscular dystrophy.
