Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders, with autosomal recessive inheritance. We report a patient with severe congenital muscular dystrophy and total deficiency in the laminin alpha2 chain. Genetic analyses showed a linkage to the MDC1A locus for the patient's family, and DNA sequencing revealed in the propositus of a new homozygous mutation in the donor splice site of intron 58 of the LAMA2 gene. RT-PCR experiments performed on total RNA from a patient's muscle biopsy showed a complete skipping of exon 58 in LAMA2 cDNA and a significant decrease in the LAMA2 mRNA level. This exon skipping altered the open reading frame of the mutant transcript and generated a premature termination codon (PTC) within exon 59, which potentially elicits the nonsense mRNA to degradation by NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay). However, the residual exon 58-lacking mRNA could potentially be translated, and the resulting truncated alpha2 chain would lack its LG4 and LG5 domains that are involved in binding with alpha-dystroglycan. These results demonstrate the utility of mRNA analysis to understand the mutation primary impact and the disease phenotype in the patients.
