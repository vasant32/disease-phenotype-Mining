Recent studies of Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy have focused on abnormalities of the basement membrane in muscle and brain. The cerebral cortex has a unique basement membrane at the glia limitans, which is intimately related to astrocytes in the developing brain, and the basement membrane may be partially produced by the astrocyte. In this study the cerebral astrocytes in six patients with Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, including two fetal patients, were characterized by immunohistochemical study. In fetal Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, astrocytes reacted less to antibodies of glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100 protein, and alphaB-crystallin than control astrocytes, but in postnatal Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, astrocytes reacted more to these antibodies and displayed beading of processes. Moreover, vimentin was positive in the astrocytes of two postnatal Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy patients. This astrocytic appearance may suggest immaturity of astrocytes in Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy. Astrocytes exhibiting beaded cytoplasmic processes were prominent at the subpia of the cortex and around vessels. The authors hypothesize that these immature astrocytes are unable to participate in the function of the cortical basement membrane, which is defective in Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy. Studies of neurons and meninges were similar to those of control subjects.
