The therapeutic effect of Glatiramer acetate, an immune modulating agent, was evaluated in the dy(2J)/dy(2J) mouse with merosin deficient congenital muscular dystrophy, which is a milder variant of the dy/dy mouse. The treated mice showed significant improvement in hind limb muscle strength measured by electronic grip strength meter and in motor performance quantified by video detection software. Glatiramer acetate treatment was associated with significantly increased expression of regeneration transcription factors MyoD and myogenin, and attenuation of the fibrosis markers vimentin and fibronectin. No effective treatment is currently available in congenital muscular dystrophy and Glatiramer acetate may present a new potential treatment for this disorder.
