We report a case of Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy with inflammatory infiltrate on muscle biopsy in an American girl of non-Japanese ancestry. The child was hypotonic, had decreased muscle strength in all extremities, and poor head control. Her mental and motor development were delayed. She developed generalized seizures at 19 months of age. Her muscle enzymes were abnormal; cranial computed tomography demonstrated hypoplasia of the cerebellum. Electromyogram was normal. Deltoid muscle biopsy documented scattered basophilic regenerating myofibers and focal atrophic fibers with focal increases of endomysial connective tissue, small endomysial foci of inflammatory cells, and occasional perimysial, perivenular lymphocytic infiltrates. Prednisone therapy produced some decrease in serum muscle enzyme levels.
