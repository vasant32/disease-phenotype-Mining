A family with an autosomal dominant type of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) will be reported. In general, an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is accepted for CMD. In 1980, Kalyanaraman et al reported another family with an autosomal dominant CMD with possible involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). Our report concerns a father and daughter suffering from CMD without CNS involvement. The histological findings, especially some mitochondrial abnormalities in the muscle biopsy were remarkable.
