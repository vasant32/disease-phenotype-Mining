Autoradiography with the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor ((3)H)nitro-L-arginine ([(3)H]L-NNA) was used to quantify NOS in cervical and lumbar spinal cord in normal and dystrophic mice. A single homogeneous population of binding sites was seen in all subregions of the gray matter in normal mice and in the superficial dorsal horn in dystrophic mice. However, in dystrophic mice, two populations were revealed in the deeper dorsal, intermediate, and ventral subregions. Pronounced immunoreactivity for neuronal NOS (nNOS), and weak immunoreactivity for endothelial NOS (eNOS), were revealed in all subregions in normal and dystrophic mice. Inducible NOS (iNOS) immunoreactivity was negligible in normal mice but intense in the deeper dorsal, intermediate, and ventral subregions in dystrophic mice. The higher affinity ((3)H)L-NNA binding site colocalized with nNOS and the lower affinity site with iNOS. It is suggested that expression of iNOS is associated with the pathological changes occurring in congenital muscular dystrophy.
