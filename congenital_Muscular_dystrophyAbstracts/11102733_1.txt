Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by type II lissencephaly, cerebellar and retinal anomalies, and congenital muscular dystrophy. We report a female diagnosed with WWS based on clinical criteria. This patient was found to have fetal hydrocephalus on ultrasonography at 29 weeks of gestation, and exhibited severe hypotonia, ocular malformations, and hydrocephalus at birth. MRI revealed type II lissencephaly, hydrocephalus, and other severe brain malformations. Genetic analysis was performed to distinguish WWS from severe Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), which has numerous findings in common. This revealed no expression of the founder haplotype or single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) abnormalities. Since the life expectancy of patients with FCMD is longer, differential diagnosis should be performed precisely.
