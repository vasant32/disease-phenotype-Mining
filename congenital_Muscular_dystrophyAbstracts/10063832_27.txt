We evaluated transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression in the muscle of four laminin alpha2-negative, four laminin alpha2-positive and seven partial laminin alpha2-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) patients, and compared it to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients and controls. TGF-beta1 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle from laminin alpha2-negative and laminin alpha2-positive CMD patients were significantly greater than in controls (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005, respectively), while in partial laminin alpha2-deficient muscular dystrophy patients the amount was not significantly higher than in controls (P > 0.1). The TGF-beta1 values were lower than those found in DMD, although the extent of fibrosis was greater in CMD than in DMD and controls. Our findings suggest that TGF-beta1 is involved in CMD muscle fibrosis, but differently from what we observed in DMD muscles as it seems not to be the major player in connective tissue proliferation.
