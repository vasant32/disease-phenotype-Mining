Astrocytes in the cerebrum and medulla oblongata of cases of Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy were examined by immunohistochemistry of oxidative modification products and free-radical scavenging enzymes because abnormal glia limitans formed by astrocytic end feet is considered to be involved in the genesis of brain lesions of Fukuywama type congenital muscular dystrophy. The study was performed on two fetal cases of Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy of 18 and 20 weeks' gestation and seven patients with Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy ranging in age from 2 to 27 years. Eight age-matched control cases were used. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to ascertain the gene phenotype of two child cases, in which prenatal gene analysis was not performed. Astrocytes, especially layer I astrocytes, of postnatal cases of Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy were weakly positivefor Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine and argpyrimidine, suggesting that they were sensitive to oxidative stress, and the accumulation may be related to the abnormal glia limitans. Secondary increase of manganese (Mn) superoxide dismutase against the increase of free radicals was considered in patients with Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy more than 14 years old considered to be homozygous for founder haplotype: homozygosity was suggested by PCR in two cases. In contrast, expression of Mn superoxide dismutase was decreased in 2- and 6-year-old children with Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy that were heterozygous. Moreover, accumulation of argpyrimidine was exclusively found in astrocytes of the 2-year-old child that exhibited severe brain lesions. Function of astrocytes might be impaired or immature in severe or heterozygous cases. These results may confirm that astrocytes play an important role in the etiology of the brain lesion.
