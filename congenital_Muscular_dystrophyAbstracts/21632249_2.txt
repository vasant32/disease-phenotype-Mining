Mutations in LMNA cause wide variety of disorders including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, and congenital muscular dystrophy. We recently found a LMNA mutation in a patient who was previously diagnosed as infantile onset inflammatory myopathy. In this study, we screened for LMNA mutations in 20 patients suspected to have inflammatory myopathy with onset at 2years or younger. The diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy was based on muscle pathology with presence of perivascular cuffing and/or endomysial/perimysial lymphocyte infiltration. We identified heterozygous LMNA mutations in 11 patients (55%), who eventually developed joint contractures and/or cardiac involvement after the infantile period. Our findings suggest that LMNA mutation should be considered in myopathy patients with inflammatory changes during infancy, and that this may help avoid life-threatening events associated with laminopathy.
