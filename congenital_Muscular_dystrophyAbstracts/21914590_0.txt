We describe two unrelated girls with congenital muscular dystrophy associated with alpha-dystroglycan deficit with no identified genetic defect, both presenting severe drug-resistant epilepsy with predominant myoclonic seizures and an unusual similar EEG pattern. Severe epilepsy has been unusually described in patients with congenital muscular dystrophies, mainly associated with Walker-Warburg, Fukuyama and muscle-eye-brain diseases.
