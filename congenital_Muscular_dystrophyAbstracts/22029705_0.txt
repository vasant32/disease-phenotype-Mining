 BACKGROUND: Mutations in the fukutin-related protein gene FKRP (MIM *606596) cause a form of congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1C) and also limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I (LGMD2I). Exercise-induced myoglobinuria, frequently occurring in metabolic myopathies, has been described in Becker muscular dystrophy and in a few cases of LGMD. OBJECTIVES: To describe that episodes with myoglobinuria, often associated with exercise-induced myalgia, may be common and a presenting symptom in patients with LGMD2I. METHODS: Data on episodes of suspected myoglobinuria and myalgia were collected from the patient records on 14 patients with a diagnosis of LGMDI. RESULTS: Five LGMD2I patients reported recurrent episodes of dark urine and myalgia after exercise, and in three of them, this was the only symptom for several years. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that episodes compatible with exercise-induced myoglobinuria may be frequent in LGMD2I.
