We report 11 children with a homogeneous clinical syndrome affecting both sexes, characterized by weakness at birth, slowly improving course, weakness of all muscle groups, arreflexia, elevated blood creatine kinase, normal nerve conduction velocity, dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy, and diffuse periventricular cortical white-matter abnormalities with sparing of corpus callosum, internal capsule, and brain stem. We compare them to 48 other previously reported similar cases and designate them as altered myelin radiographic pattern congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), which is the same as occidental CMD. We compare them to the other presently accepted phenotypes: progressive Fukuyama CMD, Walker-Warburg or cerebral-ocular CMD, and Santavuori or muscle-eye-brain CMD. We suggest that the different phenotypes are alleles of the same gene, which regulates or expresses a structural protein required for muscle integrity, myelination, and formation of the cortex. Such phenotypic diversity has been established for mutations of Xp21 in X-linked muscular dystrophies.
