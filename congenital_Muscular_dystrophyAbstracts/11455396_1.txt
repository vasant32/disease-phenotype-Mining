The cardiac features of a novel form of congenital muscular dystrophy (Salih CMD) are described in two adolescent siblings. The patients presented with severe hypotonia at birth, associated with delayed development. They could walk independently and managed to maintain walking after 13 years of age. Their muscle immunohistochemistry differed from that seen in Duchenne and Becher muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD), severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (SCARMD) due to sarcoglycan deficiency (sarcoglycanopathies), and lamininalpha2 (merosin)-deficient CMD. However, both patients had associated cardiomyopathy. Electrocardiography (ECG) in Salih CMD was characterized by delayed atrioventricular (AV) conduction, left anterior fascicular block (left axis deviation), and left atrial enlargement without evidence of atrial dysarrhythmia. Echocardiography showed features of severe left ventricular dysfunction with estimated left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% at 16 years-of-age in the older patient. A year later, multigated aquisition MUGA scan showed LVEF of 21% and dilatation of the right ventricle. Echocardiography and MUGA scan were normal in the younger patient at 15 years-of-age. ECG, echocardiography, and MUGA scan are effective techniques for diagnosing and monitoring the cardiomyopathy in Salih CMD. They can also distinguish it from features seen in the other common forms of MD, including DMD, BMD, and sarcoglycanopathies.
