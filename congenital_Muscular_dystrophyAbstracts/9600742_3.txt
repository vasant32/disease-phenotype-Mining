We conducted prenatal diagnosis by haplotype analysis, using newly developed microsatellite markers, in eight Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) families. In addition to six new families, two previously reported families were reexamined by haplotype analysis including detection of an ancestral founder haplotype (138-183-301) for 3 microsatellite markers closest to the FCMD gene, designated D9S2105-D9S2107-D9S172, the distances of which from the FCMD gene are presumed to be approximately 140, approximately 20, and approximately 280 kb, respectively. Five fetuses from five families were diagnosed as nonaffected, and were subsequently confirmed to be healthy. Three fetuses of the other three families were diagnosed as having a high probability of being affected by FCMD. In the prenatal diagnosis conducted for these eight families, the ancestral founder allele was observed in 13 of 16 (81%) FCMD-bearing chromosomes. Detection of the ancestral haplotype facilitated achieving accurate prenatal diagnosis of FCMD. The brains of all three fetuses prenatally diagnosed as FCMD-affected showed the initial stage of cortical dysplasia, strong evidence of FCMD.
