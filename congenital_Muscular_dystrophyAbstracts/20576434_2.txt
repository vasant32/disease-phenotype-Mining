Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy are part of the heterogeneous group of collagen VI-related muscle disorders. They are caused by mutations in collagen VI (ColVI) genes (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) while LMNA mutations cause autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. A muscular dystrophy pattern and contractures are found in all three conditions, making differential diagnosis difficult especially in young patients when cardiomyopathy is absent. We retrospectively assessed upper and lower limb muscle CT scans in 14 Bethlem/Ullrich patients and 13 Emery-Dreifuss patients with identified mutations. CT was able to differentiate Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy from ColVI-related myopathies in selected thigh muscles and to a lesser extent calves muscles: rectus femoris fatty infiltration was selectively present in Bethlem/Ullrich patients while posterior thigh muscles infiltration was more prominently found in Emery-Dreifuss patients. A more severe fatty infiltration particularly in the leg posterior compartment was found in the Emery-Dreifuss group.
