Deficiency of alpha2-laminin (merosin) underlies classical congenital muscular dystrophy in humans and dy/dy muscular dystrophy in mice and causes severe muscle dysfunction in both species. To gain greater insight into the biochemical and molecular events that link alpha2-laminin deficiency with muscle fiber necrosis, and the associated compensatory responses, gene expression profiles were characterized in diaphragm muscle from 8-wk-old dy/dy mice using oligonucleotide microarrays. Compared with age-matched normal muscle, dystrophic diaphragm was characterized by predominantly augmented gene expression, irrespective of the fold-change threshold. Among the 69 genes with at least plus or minus twofold significantly altered expression, 30 belonged to statistically overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) biological process groups. These covered four specific themes: development including muscle development, cell motility with an emphasis on muscle contraction, defense/immune response, and cell adhesion. An additional 11 gene transcripts were assigned to more general overrepresented GO biological process groups (e.g., cellular process, organismal physiological process); the remaining 28 did not belong to any overrepresented groups. GO cellular constituent assignment resulted in the highest degree of overrepresentation in extracellular and muscle fiber locations, whereas GO molecular function assignment was most notable for various types of binding. RT-PCR was performed on 38 of 41 genes with at least plus or minus twofold significantly altered expression that were assigned to overrepresented GO biological process groups, with expression changes verified for 36 of 38 genes. These results indicate that several specific groups of genes have altered expression in response to genetic alpha2-laminin deficiency, with both similarities and differences compared with data reported for dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophies.
