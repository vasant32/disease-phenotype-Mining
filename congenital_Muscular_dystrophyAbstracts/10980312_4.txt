A female patient who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of Walker-Warburg syndrome had muscle biopsy finding of muscular dystrophy. There was normal expression of merosin (laminin alpha2 chain) and dystrophin and only slightly reduced dystrophin-associated glycoprotein expression. On genetic analysis, she had no specific haplotype, the common mutation of 3kb insertion, or point mutations in the Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy gene, suggesting that the two diseases are not genetically identical.
