Clinical features of a rare congenital myopathy, muscle-eye-brain (MEB) disease, are described in 19 patients. The pedigree data suggest an autosomal recessive inheritance. The patients presented with congenital hypotonia and muscle weakness. Serum CK was elevated, EMG was myopathic and muscle biopsy showed slight or moderate changes compatible with muscular dystrophy. Ophthalmological findings included severe visual failure and uncontrolled eye movements associated with severe myopia. The flash VEPs were exceptionally high, whereas non-corneal ERG was unrecordable. The EEG showed progressive abnormalities after the age of 6 months. Psychomotor development was slow during the first years of life, and mental retardation was severe. Most patients began to deteriorate around age 5 years. This change included spasticity and joint contractures. CT scans showed ventricular dilatations and abnormally low white matter density in several patients. Spasticity, high VEPs and ocular manifestations differentiate MEB from the Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy.
