Administration of succinylcholine to normal individuals results in alterations in muscle membrane integrity expressed as a slight increase in the concentrations of creatine phosphokinase (CK) in serum and appearance of small amounts of myoglobin in the urine, but without clinical symptoms. Subjects with strabismus due to congenital muscular dystrophy may develop more significant rhabdomyolysis expressed as muscle stiffness and weakness, massive myoglobinuria, marked elevation of serum CK and other enzymes, metabolic acidosis, tachycardia and moderate elevation of body temperature. In some cases grave malignant hyperthermia with significant hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, tachycardia and marked abnormalities in serum electrolyte concentrations may cause irreversible damage to the central nervous system and other vital organs and death. A case of difficult anaesthesia for a six year old boy belonging to family affected with muscular dystrophy is presented. More attention must be given to preoperative examination (anamnesis, serum enzymes) or ophthalmological patients and more careful monitoring during anaesthesia and in the early postoperative period must be instituted to prevent and treat complications induced by succinylcholine and volatile anaesthetic agents.
