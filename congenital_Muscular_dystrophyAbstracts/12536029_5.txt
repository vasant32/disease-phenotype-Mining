Floppiness in an infant may have a number of different etiologies from disorders of the brain to spinal cord lesions, neuropathies, neuromuscular junction disorders and myopathies. In this study we aimed to investigate the correlation of muscle ultrasonography (US) and electromyography (EMG) in the diagnosis of floppy infants. The study encompassed 41 floppy infants aged 2-24 months. The muscle US and EMG examinations were performed without awareness of the clinical diagnosis. The final diagnosis was established by molecular genetic tests or muscle/nerve biopsy. The neurogenic group consisted of 16 infants according to their US and EMG findings. Fifteen of them had spinal muscular atrophy proven by genetic analysis and one had polyneuropathy diagnosed by nerve biopsy. Six infants were in the myopathic group according to their muscle US and EMG results. All of them underwent muscle biopsy and microscopic examination revealed five congenital muscular dystrophy and one glycogen storage disease. In two infants the US and EMG data conflicted. Their biopsies were also insufficient for the diagnosis. Seventeen infants had normal US and EMG findings but pathologic cranial magnetic resonance imaging or metabolic/genetic tests. They were considered in the group of central hypotonia. Our results suggest a high concordance of US and EMG findings in the diagnostic work-up of neurogenic and myopathic disorders.
