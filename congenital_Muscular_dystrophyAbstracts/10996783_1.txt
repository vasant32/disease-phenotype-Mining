Muscular transverse relaxation times values were measured in vivo in normal mice (strain C57BL6/J, n=14) and in murine models of human congenital muscular dystrophy (dy/dy, n=9; dy(2j)/dy(2j), n=8). A single-slice multi-echo sequence was used. Gastrocnemius/soleus complex, thigh and buttock muscles were studied. Muscular transverse relaxation times values were compared between different muscle groups in each type of animal and between animal groups. Differences were observed between normal and dy(2j)/dy(2j) mice from 3 to 12 weeks of age, and between normal and dy/dy mice at 6 weeks. In specific age ranges, the values of muscular transverse relaxation times in two dystrophic models are different from those in normal mice, and could thus be used as an index of modifications in dystrophic muscle to evaluate therapies.
