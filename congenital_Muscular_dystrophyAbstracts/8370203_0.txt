Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) is a concept applied to infants showing muscular weakness and hypotonia at birth, with myopathic changes which are histopathologically similar to those of muscular dystrophy. Patients with Fukuyama-type CMD (FCMD), characterized by progressive muscular dystrophy, mental retardation and occasionally, convulsions, are more frequently seen in Japan than those with non-Fukuyama type CMD (NFCMD). FCMD has been regarded as a distinct clinical and pathological entity, although the nosologic status of CMD is still controversial. A 24-year-old man had exhibited hypotonia and weakness at birth and delay in early development. During childhood, his muscular weakness improved, and he rode a bicycle and enjoyed skiing. However, his strength began to deteriorate at the age of 19 years. Neurological examination on admission revealed prominent muscular wasting and weakness, predominantly in the proximal limbs. He had ocular involvement (corneal opacity and slow saccades), sensorineural deafness, and a high-arched palate, saddle nose and funnel chest as anomalous conditions. Serum CK was moderately elevated and EMG showed myogenic patterns. A muscle biopsy specimen of the left biceps brachii was dystrophic, showing increased variation in fiber size with fibrous tissue proliferation, an increased number of centralized nuclei, fiber splitting and degenerating/regenerating fibers. Those findings were compatible with those seen in NFCMD. In Japan, only one patient with NFCMD who was followed to adulthood has been reported. This patient's symptoms progressed very slowly. The present patient's course of illness was stable during childhood but progressive in early adulthood. It suggests heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
