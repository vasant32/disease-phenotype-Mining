Using immunocytochemical methods, we examined the intensity and distribution of dystrophin and spectrin immunostaining of skeletal muscles from 51 congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) patients including 36 Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) and 15 non-FCMD (other CMD). 17 age-matched spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and 5 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patient biopsies were studied as controls. All 15 non-FCMD and SMA patients showed normal localization of dystrophin at the surface membrane of each muscle fiber which was undetectable in DMD. In contrast, 34 of 36 FCMD patients exhibited an unusual immunostaining pattern with occasional (17-43%; mean = 28) negative or abnormally immunoreacted (partially deficient, fluffy or intense) fibers for dystrophin. Dystrophin was absent in 2 of 36 patients having a clinical diagnosis of FCMD, and intragenic deletion of the DMD gene was detected in one. Spectrin, a membrane cytoskeletal protein related to dystrophin, also showed an increased number of abnormally immunostained fibers in FCMD (25%), but not so high in age-matched DMD (9%) or SMA patient muscle (0%). Thus, our results suggested the presence of intrinsic factor(s) that produce abnormality of the plasma membrane of FCMD muscle.
