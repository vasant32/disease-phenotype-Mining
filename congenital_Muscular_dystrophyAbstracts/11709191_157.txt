Muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy, ocular abnormalities, and lissencephaly. Mammalian O-mannosyl glycosylation is a rare type of protein modification that is observed in a limited number of glycoproteins of brain, nerve, and skeletal muscle. Here we isolated a human cDNA for protein O-mannose beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (POMGnT1), which participates in O-mannosyl glycan synthesis. We also identified six independent mutations of the POMGnT1 gene in six patients with MEB. Expression of most frequent mutation revealed a great loss of the enzymatic activity. These findings suggest that interference in O-mannosyl glycosylation is a new pathomechanism for muscular dystrophy as well as neuronal migration disorder.
