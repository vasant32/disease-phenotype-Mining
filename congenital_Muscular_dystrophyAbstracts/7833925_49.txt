Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) are autosomal recessive, heterogeneous disorders. The commonest forms are the Fukuyama CMD (FCMD), associated with mental retardation and structural brain anomalies, and classical (occidental) CMD, with pure muscle expression. FCMD has been localized to chromosome 9q31-q33. Following the discovery of merosin deficiency in some CMD cases, we have localized, by homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis (Zmax = 5.6; theta = 0.0 for marker AFM127xb2) in four merosin-negative families a CMD gene in a 16 cM region of chromosome 6q2 in the region of the laminin M chain gene. In three consanguineous, merosin-positive, CMD families there was no linkage to either chromosome 6q2 or 9q31-q33.
