We report the cases of 18 patients with congenital muscular dystrophy, six of whom also have involvement of the central nervous system, corresponding to the Fukuyama type of congenital muscular dystrophy. In four patients, both the central nervous system and the eyes are involved, and the diagnosis of "muscle, eye and brain disease" was made. A comparative study of these patients with those whose cases were recently reported indicates that there is a wide variability of clinical and laboratory expression of the dystrophy, but a constant feature in all patients is a progression of motor disability. The association of congenital muscular dystrophy with brain abnormalities indicates a poor clinical prognosis. At present it remains an open question whether the three variants of the disease are separate diseases or only different expressions of the same syndrome, but our study tends to support the latter hypothesis.
