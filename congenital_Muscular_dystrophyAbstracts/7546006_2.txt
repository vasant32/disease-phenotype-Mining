Volume selective proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of brain was performed on a 1.5 T magnet in 5 patients with congenital muscular dystrophy and compared to the results in 46 healthy children and 1 healthy adult. Peaks of N-acetyl aspartate, choline, and creatine but not lactate, were observed in both groups on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Spectroscopy of controls revealed an increase with advancing age in the ratio of N-acetyl aspartate/choline and N-acetyl aspartate/creatine and a decrease in the choline/creatine ratio. In patients with congenital myotonic dystrophy, the N-acetyl aspartate/choline ratio did not increase with advancing age, but the N-acetyl aspartate/creatine ratio did. The choline/creatine ratio decreased with advancing age, which matched the results of controls. At any age older than 4 years, the N-acetyl aspartate/choline and N-acetyl aspartate/creatine ratios were lower in patients with congenital myotonic dystrophy than in controls. The choline/creatine ratio did not differ between congenital myotonic dystrophy and controls. These results suggest that in patients with congenital myotonic dystrophy N-acetyl aspartate decreases and there exists a developmental disorder of neurons in brain.
