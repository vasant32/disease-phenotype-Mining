M-laminin is a major member of the laminin family of basement membrane proteins. It is prominently expressed in striated muscle and peripheral nerve. M-laminin is deficient in patients with the autosomal recessive Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy but is normal in patients with the sex-linked Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. We have examined M-laminin expression in mice with autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy caused by the mutation dy. The heavy chain of M-laminin was undetectable in skeletal muscle, heart muscle, and peripheral nerve by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting in homozygous dystrophic dy/dy mice but was normal in heterozygous and wild-type nondystrophic mice. Immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of other major basement membrane proteins in the dystrophic mice. Very low levels of M-laminin heavy chain mRNA were detected by Northern blotting of muscle and heart tissue from dy/dy mice, suggesting that M-laminin heavy-chain mRNA may be produced at very low levels or is unstable. Information about the chromosomal localization of the M heavy-chain in human and mouse suggests that a mutation in the M-chain gene causes the muscular dystrophy in dy/dy mice. The dy mouse may provide a model for autosomal muscular dystrophies in humans and facilitate studies of functions of M-laminin.
