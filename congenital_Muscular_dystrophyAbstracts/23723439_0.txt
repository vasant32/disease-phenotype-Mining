Dystroglycan (DG) is a cell surface glycoprotein that connects extracellular matrix molecules to the intracellular cytoskeleton, functioning as mechanical and signaling axes in various physiological events. Since the ligand binding activity of DG strictly depends on O-mannosyl glycans attached to its extracellular α-DG subunit, aberrant glycosylation causes dystroglycanopathy, a subclass of congenital muscular dystrophy. Accumulating evidence shows that like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE), a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of a phosphodiester-linked modification on O-mannose, is essential for α-DG to gain the ligand binding activity. We previously reported that human natural killer-1 sulfotransferase (HNK-1ST), which was originally reported as one of the enzymes responsible for HNK-1 glyco-epitope, had an ability to suppress the glycosylation and function of α-DG. In this study, we investigated how HNK-1ST regulates the glycosylation of α-DG using deletion and mutation analyses. We generated an α-DG mutant which has only one threonine residue capable of being modified by LARGE. Focusing on the single post-phosphoryl modification site, we found that HNK-1ST showed an almost complete inhibition of the LARGE-dependent modification and transferred a sulfate group to the phosphodiester-linked moiety on O-mannose. Furthermore, using an in vitro enzymatic assay system, we demonstrated that the sulfated α-DG by HNK-1ST is no longer glycosylated by LARGE. These results illustrate one possible glycosylation pathway where α-DG function is regulated by opposing actions of HNK-1ST and LARGE.
