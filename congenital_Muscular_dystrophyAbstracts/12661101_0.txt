We report three patients with sporadic merosin-positive congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) with torticollis and/or developmental dislocation of the hip in early childhood. Diagnosis of merosin-positive CMD was based on their clinical and dystrophic muscle biopsy findings. At the age 13 months, patient 1 was found to have developmental dislocation of both hips, which was surgically treated at 5 years. Patient 2 had severe torticollis and contracture of both hip joints which had been present since the neonatal period, and underwent repair of the torticollis at 2 years. Patient 3 was found to have developmental dislocation of the left hip at one month of age. Although she had generalized muscle hypotonia she learned to walk at 23 months. She had no facial muscle involvement nor contracture of joints, but had hyperlaxity of distal joints. Her muscle biopsy showed complete collagen VI deficiency immunohistochemically. In contrast to merosin-deficient CMD, merosin-positive CMD appears to be a group of heterogeneous diseases. Since collagen VI was reported to be defective in Ullrich's disease, patient 3 may be diagnosed as having Ullrich's disease but had no typical clinical characteristics of the disease. Further study is needed to identify the pathogenetic mechanism of congenital muscular dystrophy with early joint abnormalities to determine whether there is a primary abnormality of the connective tissue including collagen VI.
