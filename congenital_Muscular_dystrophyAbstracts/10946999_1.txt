Immunocytochemical analysis of the laminin alpha-2 (merosin) chain in the muscle of patients with Classic Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (Cl-CMD) differentiates the types of the disease associated with a merosin deficit from those that are merosin positive. Patients with Central Nervous System involvement in merosin negative Cl-CMD always present alterations of the white matter at RMI, but usually these are not clinically significant. While ocular malformations (microphthalmia, alterations of the anterior chamber, of the retina, or of the angle and cataract) and damage to the Central Nervous System are described in some subtypes of CMD (Muscle Eye Brain disease, Walker Warburg Syndrome), ocular involvement and retino-cortical conduction in merosin negative Cl-CMD are not well known. This study reports on four patients affected by merosin negative Cl-CMD. All these patients presented important alterations of the white matter associated with ventricular enlargement and, in one case, with pachygyria and micropolygyria. Refraction, visual acuity, ocular motility, anterior segment and fundus were examined. ERG Maximal, Cone and Rod response, VEP transient pattern reversal was carried out as well. Significant alterations at the standard ophthalmologic examination or of the electroretinogram responses were not registered while, in all cases, important modifications in retino cortical conduction (reduction in amplitude, increase in latency, reduction in amplitude on the lateral derivations) were observed, demonstrating involvement of the optic pathway at different levels during the course of this disease.
