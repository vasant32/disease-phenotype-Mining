The congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD, MDC) represent a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders manifesting in infancy by muscle weakness and hypotonia. Approximately 40% of patients with CMD have a primary deficiency of the laminin alpha 3. chain of merosin (laminin-2) due to mutations in LAMA2 gene. Laminin-2 bound to alpha-dystroglycan forms a link between actin--associated cytoskeletal proteins and the components of extracellular matrix. Disruption of this axis is responsible for several forms of muscular dystrophy. A unique case of congenital muscular dystrophy simulating a juvenile polymyositis in a muscle biopsy is presented. A profound reduction of alpha-dystroglycan and less pronounced secondary deficiency of alpha 2-laminin were found. All known forms of CMD were excluded, and the disorder was diagnosed as so far undescribed form of CMD. The mutation in a gene encoding the protein, that seems to play a role in a glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, is presumed.
