We analyzed and quantified the microcomponents of protein fractions in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with various types of muscular dystrophy. The degenerative pattern is characterized by an increase in the prealbumin fraction and a decrease in the gamma-globulin fraction as shown in the Duchenne and congenital muscular dystrophy. The increase in CSF IgG, gamma-globulin fraction, and myelin basic protein is shown in the myotonic dystrophy. In addition to the lowness of IQ, and the abnormality of EEG and brain CT, abnormal CSF proteins obviously suggest the presence of CNS involvement in muscular dystrophy.
