We present ocular findings of 20 patients with the recessively inherited muscle-eye-brain (MEB) disease, characterised by severe visual failure, mental retardation, a pachygyria-polymicrogyria type neuronal migration disorder and congenital muscular dystrophy. The ocular findings consisted of myopia ranging from -6 to -27 D, retinal degeneration and optic atrophy. Five infants had congenital glaucoma, and juvenile cataracts developed in 9 children. The visual evoked potentials were abnormally high (> 50 microV) and delayed in 70% of patients. The electroretinogram was abolished in 12 patients. The changes were progressive during the follow-up time, which was up to 20 years.
