The clinical profile of 33 children (19 boys, 14 girls) with multiple congenital contractures has been studied. The majority (54%) belong to arthrogryposis multiplex congenita with a static clinical course. Children were classified into three groups: group I (limb involvement only; n = 21) having arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (n = 18), distal arthrogryposis syndrome (n = 2) and Streeter syndrome (n = 1); group II (limb involvement with other malformation or anomalies; n = 7) having congenital contractural arachnodactyly (n = 3), Larsen syndrome (n = 1), multiple pterygium syndrome (n = 1), craniocarpotarsal dystrophy (n = 1), and Schwartz Jampel syndrome (n = 1); and group III (limb involvement with central nervous system dysfunction or mental retardation; n = 5) having myotonia dystrophica (n = 2), congenital muscular dystrophy (n = 1), foetal alcohol syndrome (n = 1) and Pena-Shokeir syndrome (n = 1). Three children died, one each of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, congenital contractural arachnodactyly and myotonia dystrophica. The majority had a good prognosis with independent function and mobility.
