Three female cases of the "rigid spine" syndrome are reported and associated with different nosological entities. One patient was affected by congenital muscular dystrophy and one by a morphological pattern of fibre type disproportion with type I atrophy. The third patient showed very peculiar morphological changes on a muscle biopsy specimen resembling a vacuolar myopathy, which is rarely described in association with the rigid spine syndrome. The importance of an adequate investigation of the rigid spine syndrome and the recognition of the presence or absence of cardiomyopathy, if there is to be correct genetic counselling, is discussed.
