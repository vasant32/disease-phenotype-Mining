This report concerns light and electron microscopic studies on the central nervous system of a 20-week and an 18-week fetus with Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD). The diagnosis of FCMD was established by prenatal molecular genetic analysis. Cerebral lesions containing neurites, subpial granular cells and glias, accompanied by cortical dysplasia were found in both cases. Small irregular defects, readily detectable by periodic acid-methenamine-silver staining or by immunohistochemical staining for S-100 protein, were observed in the cerebral surface. More severe dysplasia was evident at the areas with the larger defects. Surface defects were also observed in the cerebellum and brain stem, with brain tissue extruding into the leptomeninges. The pyramidal tract was aberrant in the pons and medulla oblongata. The spinal cord appeared normal by light microscopy. Electron microscopic examination revealed an abnormal configuration of the basement membrane and glial cytoplasmic membrane of the brain and spinal cord surfaces, including areas with no detectable defects by light microscopy. These findings suggest that abnormalities of the pial-glial barrier, especially the basement membrane and/or basement membrane-related structures, are involved in the genesis of cortical dysplasia.
