The dystroglycanopathies comprise a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of muscular dystrophies characterized by deficient glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Mutations in the fukutin (FKTN) gene have primarily been identified among patients with classic Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), a severe form of dystroglycanopathy characterized by CMD, cobblestone lissencephaly and ocular defects. We describe two brothers of Caucasian and Japanese ancestry with normal intelligence and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) due to compound heterozygous FKTN mutations. Muscle biopsy showed a dystrophy with selectively reduced alpha-dystroglycan glycoepitope immunostaining. Immunoblots revealed hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan and loss of laminin binding. FKTN gene sequencing identified two variants: c.340G>A and c.527T>C, predicting missense mutations p.A114T and p.F176S, respectively. Our results provide further evidence for ethnic and allelic heterogeneity and the presence of milder phenotypes in FKTN-dystroglycanopathy despite a substantial degree of alpha-dystroglycan hypoglycosylation in skeletal muscle.
