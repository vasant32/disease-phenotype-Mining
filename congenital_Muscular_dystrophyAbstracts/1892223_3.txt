Blood vessels in muscle biopsy specimens from 6 Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) patients were examined by electron microscopy and compared with ones in non-diagnostic biopsy specimens from age-matched controls and patients with childhood neuromuscular disorders. The most striking feature was the blister-like swelling of vascular endothelial cells in the biopsied muscle specimens from 5 of the 6 patients with FCMD. Morphometric analysis of capillaries in biopsied muscles showed the extremely greater capillary, endothelial and pericyte areas in the FCMD patients than in controls. These phenomena are quite similar to those found in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) at the preclinical stage and suggest an as yet undetermined process in blood vessels in FCMD as well as DMD. An immunohistochemical study involving dystrophin antibodies showed positive staining in FCMD.
