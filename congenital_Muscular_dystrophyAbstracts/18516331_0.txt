Merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) is the most common form of congenital muscular dystrophy. MDC1A is caused by mutation of the laminin alpha-2 gene (LAMA2), localized to chromosome 6q22-23. The diagnosis of merosin-deficient CMD is based on the clinical findings of severe congenital hypotonia, weakness, with high blood levels of creatine kinase, WM abnormalities, and dystrophy associated with negative immunostaining of biopsied muscle for merosin. We investigated clinical and laboratory a patient: a girl with merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A. Clinically the particularity of the case is the association of merosin-negative congenital muscular dystrophy (MN-CMD) with congenital feet deformity. The level of serum creatine kinase is elevated 1045 U/L. Immunohistochemistry show presence of dystrophin, lack of merosin, also the utrophin is normally expressed. Nerve conduction studies are normally, while electromyography suggested a myopathic process with early recruitment and decreased amplitude and duration of response. Magnetic resonance imaging: MRI T1 and MRI T2 show hypointensity and diffuse hyperintensity respectively in the white matter. Supratentorial MRI images showed hypotrophy of the corpus callosum and almost absent cingulate gyrus. In addition, hypophysis is reduced size.
