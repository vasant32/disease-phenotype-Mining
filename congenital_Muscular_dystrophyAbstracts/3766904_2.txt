Two 10-year-old boys with mental retardation and myopathy which were present since birth are described. Both had elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CK) and one of them had a positive family history. The clinical features were consistent with Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy, but muscle biopsies suggested an inflammatory process. Adrenal cortical steroids were given and they were followed up until 10 years of age. Serum CK showed a significant response to the treatment, and mental retardation in case 1 and motor dysfunction in case 2 improved. It is postulated that an inflammatory process might be a causative factor in some patients with congenital muscular dystrophy.
