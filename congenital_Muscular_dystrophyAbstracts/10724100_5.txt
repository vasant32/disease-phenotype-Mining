Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) encompasses a heterogenous group of muscle disorders with autosomal recessive inheritance, characterized by muscular weakness and hypotonia at birth or within the first few months of life and developmental delay. Merosin-deficient CMD is a clinically distinct form which may be associated with significant abnormalities of the brain detectable by neuroimaging. We report two siblings of consanguineous parents with merosin-deficient CMD in an Irish family who in addition to the characteristic white matter abnormalities on neuroimaging, had occipital dysplasia. Clinical, electrophysiological muscle biopsy findings and neuroimaging were very similar in both cases. Although merosin-deficient CMD with white matter abnormalities on neuroimaging is well documented in the literature, the association with occipital dysplasia has only rarely been reported. The appearance of an identical cortical defect in these siblings suggests an underlying genetic mechanism.
