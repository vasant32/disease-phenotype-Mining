Thirteen cases of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita without evidence of spinal muscular atrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, or structural myopathy were reviewed. Family history, consanguinity, pregnancy, delivery, number and severity of contractures, and outcome were evaluated. Laboratory investigations had been performed and a biopsy of muscle from an affected limb had been examined histochemically and by electron microscopy. Five biopsies showed fiber type 1 predominance and three had type 2 predominance. Patterns of fiber-type predominance may have resulted from altered neural influence leading to impaired maturation of type 1 or 2 motor units. Nine patients had been followed up for 3-8 years. Two were still not walking at age 8 years. For the 6 who were walking, the mean age at ambulation was 4.7 years. There was no deterioration in power. Muscle biopsy is recommended in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Identification of a probable neurogenic arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is important because the condition is not progressive and is apparently not transmitted genetically.
