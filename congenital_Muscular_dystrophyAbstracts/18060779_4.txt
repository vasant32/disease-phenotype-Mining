Limb-girdle muscle dystrophy type 2I is associated with mutations in the gene encoding Fukutin-related protein. Clinical phenotypes are heterogeneous, ranging from isolated hyperCkemia to severe congenital muscular dystrophy. Affected patients frequently develop dilated cardiomyopathy, depending on evolution of their skeletal myopathy. We report on an 8 years-old boy presenting a severe dilated cardiomyopathy requiring heart transplantation. The child harbored a homozygous p.Leu276Ile mutation in Fukutin-related protein gene (FKRP). At the current age of 20 years, the patient shows persistent hyperCKemia but no clinical muscle weakness, CT scan showing very mild features of muscle involvement. Our findings add to the array of clinical presentations of FKRP mutations.
