A 31-year-old tracheostomized woman weighing 32.5 kg with Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy in terminal stage was scheduled for dilatation of the tracheostoma, removal of the tracheal granulomas and reconstruction of gastrostoma. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with continuous propofol infusion and intermittent fentanyl. Muscle relaxant was not necessary because of generalized severe muscular atrophy. There was no hemodynamic derangement during the surgery and emergence from the anesthesia was rapid. There were no postoperative complications related to anesthesia and surgery.
