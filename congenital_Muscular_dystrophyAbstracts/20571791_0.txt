Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) is characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy and associated with neuropathological anomalies. However, the issue of whether the radiological findings of white-matter lesions represent delayed myelination, demyelination or other problems remains controversial. We present serial radiological findings, including MR spectroscopy (MRS), in a child with FCMD. These findings indicate a correlation between the imaging abnormalities and the choline/creatine ratio, suggesting the possible usefulness of MRS in addition to MRI for following FCMD patients.
