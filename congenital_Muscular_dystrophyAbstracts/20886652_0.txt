LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy (L-CMD) is a recently described disorder characterized by infantile-onset myopathy due to mutations in the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene. We report the genetic and clinical characteristics of two unrelated L-CMD patients. Patient 1 harbored a novel, L35P mutation and patient 2 a previously reported R249W mutation. The striking phenotype associated with L-CMD is important to recognize, as molecular diagnostic testing can spare patients unnecessary procedures and prompt the physician to monitor for associated cardiac arrhythmias.
