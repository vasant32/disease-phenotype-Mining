Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder prevalent in Japan that is characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy, cobblestone lissencephaly, and eye anomalies. We examined 46 patients with Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy and followed their progress for more than 3 years, with special reference to long-term prognosis of seizure disorders and the relationship between seizures and neuropathologic abnormalities. Seizures were observed in 37 patients (80%). The average age at onset was 3 years, 1 month. Initial seizures usually occurred after a febrile episode, although one third of patients had afebrile seizures from the onset. All patients had generalized tonic-clonic convulsions at febrile disorders, and these were followed by complex partial seizures or secondary generalized seizures. Later these seizures developed into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in three patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed paroxysmal discharges in 22 of 37 patients with seizures (59%). The main focus was in the frontal, temporal, or central region. Lesions with marked cortical dysplasia detected by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or autopsy showed focal paroxysmal discharges on EEG.
