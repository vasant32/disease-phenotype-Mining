A particular form of congenital muscular dystrophy is associated with a deficiency of the tissue-specific basement membrane protein laminin alpha 2. A more precise knowledge of the normal distribution and localization of laminin alpha 2 would be useful in further elucidating the development of this disorder. In this study we used specific electron microscopic techniques, i.e., thin-section fracture labeling and cryoultramicrotomy in combination with immunogold labeling for laminin alpha 2, to determine its ultrastructural localization in normal human muscle and peripheral nerve. Both in muscle and in peripheral nerve, laminin alpha 2 is found to be associated solely with the basal lamina of myofibers and Schwann cells, respectively. Of special interest is the finding that in peripheral nerve, laminin alpha 2 is associated only with myelinated and not with unmyelinated nerve fibers.
