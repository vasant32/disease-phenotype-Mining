Biglycan has been considered a good candidate for neuromuscular disease based on direct interactions with collagen VI and alpha-dystroglycan, both of which are linked with congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD). We screened 83 patients with CMD and other neuromuscular disorders and six controls for mutations and variations in the biglycan sequence. We identified a number of novel sequence variations. After family analysis and control screening we found that none of these polymorphisms were disease-causing mutations. Thus mutations in biglycan are not a common cause of neuromuscular disorders in our cohort.
