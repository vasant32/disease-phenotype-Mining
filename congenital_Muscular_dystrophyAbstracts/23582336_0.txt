Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) is one of the most common autosomal recessive diseases among the Japanese population, due to a founder mutation of the fukutin gene (FKTN). Mutations in FKTN are now being described in an increasing number of non-Japanese patients. We report a Portuguese child with FCMD. The diagnosis was supported by clinical, histological, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genetic studies. Genetic analysis of FKTN by Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA) revealed a homozygous duplication from exon 4 to exon 7. This in-frame duplication was confirmed by cDNA analysis. To our knowledge this is the first report of a FCMD case caused by an intragenic gross exonic duplication in the FKTN gene. This report widens the clinical and mutational spectrum in FCMD and corroborates the importance of screening for large deletions and duplications in CMD patients.
