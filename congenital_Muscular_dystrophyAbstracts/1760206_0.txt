The clinical effect of mechanical ventilatory assistance with tracheotomy in respiratory failure of terminal phase muscular dystrophy was studied. The subjects were 6 Duchenne muscular dystrophy cases and 1 Ullrich type congenital muscular dystrophy case. Duration of the longest survival case was 4 years and 5 months. General physical conditions, complications, ADL and muscular atrophy were examined. By ventilatory assistance respiratory failure improved, and the physical condition stabilized and took good progress. Arterial hemorrhage which is lethal complication was observed in 2 cases. Mechanical ventilatory assistance with tracheotomy is an effective symptomatic therapy for the improvement of respiratory failure that can be applied when life prolongation is wished for by the patients or their families.
