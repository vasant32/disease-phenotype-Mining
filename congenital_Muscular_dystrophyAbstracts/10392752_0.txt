We report on two siblings that have been followed for 14 years, with merosin-positive congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), cataract, retinitis pigmentosa, dysversion of the optic disc, but no cerebral anomalies, except for microcephaly and slight mental retardation (MR). The younger child had three generalized seizures easily controlled by anticonvulsant therapy. Both children presented hypotonia from birth, delayed psychomotor development, generalized muscular weakness, and atrophy and joint contractures of knees and ankles. The course of the disease, apparently static during the first 10 years of life, became progressive during the second decade with loss of deambulation by the age of 13. Creatine kinase was increased in both children. Bilateral cataract was diagnosed at 6-months of age. In spite of the occurrence of microcephaly, MR was slight and the siblings acquired reading and writing skills after the aged 10. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed normal results in both siblings. The classification of these cases within the broad spectrum of CMD is difficult since most of the known muscle-eye-brain syndromes generally show severe MR and brain anomalies. We consider these cases as corresponding to the rarer syndromes of merosin-positive CMD with associated features such as cataract and MR that were particularly emphasized during the 50th ENMC International Workshop on CMD [Dubowitz V. Workshop report: 50th ENMC International workshop on congenital muscular dystrophy. Neuromusc Disord 1997;7:539-547]. Further genetic, pathological, neuroradiological, and immunocytochemical studies will be necessary for better elucidation of the classification and pathogenesis of CMD.
