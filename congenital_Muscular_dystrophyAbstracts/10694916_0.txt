The laminina2-chain gene (LAMA2) encodes a basal lamina protein, laminina2, known to be deficient in one form of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD). In a laminina2 deficient-CMD patient, we screened the entire LAMA2 cDNA (953bp) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction combined with single strand conformational polymorphism analysis. Direct sequencing of aberrant conformers in this patient revealed two loss-of-function mutations, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. The patient had two novel heterozygous mutations: 1) an exon 4 nonsense mutation caused by a G-->A substitution at cDNA position 547, changing the TGG codon for tryptophan into a TGA stop codon (W166X) in the N-terminus domain VI;ii) an exon 54 frameshift mutation due to a deletion of nucleotide 'C' at cDNA position 7707 (S2553Y), resulting in a premature stop codon (V2587X) in exon 55 in the globular G domain of laminina2 at the C-terminus. These mutations cause a disruption of the open reading frame of LAMA2. The absence of laminina2 observed in the patient's muscle biopsy could result from diminished levels of the LAMA2 transcript. Alternatively, the mutations might lead to translation of a truncated laminina2. By either mechanism the phenotype of congenital muscular dystrophy is believed to be the result of disruption of linkage between the extracellular matrix and the dystrophin glycoprotein complex.
