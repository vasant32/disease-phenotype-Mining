Genetic defects in like-glycosyltransferase (LARGE) cause congenital muscular dystrophy with central nervous system manifestations. The underlying molecular pathomechanism is the hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), which is evidenced by diminished immunoreactivity to IIH6C4 and VIA4-1, antibodies that recognize carbohydrate epitopes. Previous studies indicate that LARGE participates in the formation of a phosphoryl glycan branch on O-linked mannose or it modifies complex N- and mucin O-glycans. In this study, we overexpressed LARGE in neural stem cells deficient in protein O-mannosyltransferase 2 (POMT2), an enzyme required for O-mannosyl glycosylation. The results showed that overexpressing LARGE did not lead to hyperglycosylation of α-DG in POMT2 knockout (KO) cells but did generate IIH6C4 and VIA4-1 immunoreactivity and laminin-binding activity. Additionally, overexpressing LARGE in cells deficient in both POMT2 and α-DG generated laminin-binding IIH6C4 immunoreactivity. These results indicate that LARGE expression resulted in the glycosylation of proteins other than α-DG in the absence of O-mannosyl glycosylation. The IIH6C4 immunoreactivity generated in double-KO cells was largely removed by treatment either with peptide N-glycosidase F or with cold aqueous hydrofluoric acid, suggesting that LARGE expression caused phosphoryl glycosylation of N-glycans. However, the glycosylation of α-DG by LARGE is dependent on POMT2, indicating that LARGE expression only modifies O-linked mannosyl glycans of α-DG. Thus, LARGE expression mediates the phosphoryl glycosylation of not only O-mannosyl glycans including those on α-DG but also N-glycans on proteins other than α-DG.
