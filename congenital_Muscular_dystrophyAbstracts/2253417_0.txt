We examined serum cardiac myosin light chain I (LCI), serum creatine kinase (CK) levels and left ventricular function in patients with muscular dystrophy and secondary cardiac involvement. LCI levels were determined by a two-site immunoradiometric assay method in 25 patients with muscular dystrophy and 10 normal subjects. This study included 15 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), 8 patients with Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) and 2 sisters with non-Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy (nFCMD). We measured the value of left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) using echocardiography. All patients with DMD and FCMD showed moderate or severe skeletal muscle weakness. The mean values of LCI were significantly higher in patients with DMD (11.0 +/- 8.3 ng/ml, p less than 0.01) and in patients with FCMD (1.6 +/- 1.4 ng/ml, p less than 0.05) than in normal subjects (0.3 +/- 0.2 ng/ml). In patients with DMD, LCI level correlated closely with CK level (r = 0.81, p less than 0.01) but not with FS (r = 0.35, n.s.). In patients with FCMD, LCI level correlated significantly with CK level (r = 0.75, p less than 0.05) but not with FS (r = 0.44, n.s.). Close correlation between LCI and CK levels was thought to result from the cross reaction between cardiac LCI and myosin light chains of skeletal muscle in the assay method we used. Two siblings with nFCMD showed mild skeletal muscle weakness. A 22-year-old sister with mild left ventricular dysfunction (FS = 0.41) showed high level of CK (4794/U/L) and mild elevation of LCI (7.3 ngml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
