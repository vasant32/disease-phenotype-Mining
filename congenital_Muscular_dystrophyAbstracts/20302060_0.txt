This article is a case study of a 16-year-old female with congenital muscular dystrophy. It aims to raise awareness of some of the issues associated with complex illness during adolescence, particularly the transition from child to adult services. To improve care it is argued that the needs and values of the young person should be respected and interventions planned locally with the young person and their family where appropriate.
