Walker-Warburg syndrome is a lethal, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by anomalies of the central nervous system and eye. Typical findings include hydrocephalus, agyria, retinal dysplasia, cerebellar dysgenesis, anterior chamber dysgenesis, and encephalocele. Recently, the phenotypic spectrum has been expanded to include congenital muscular dystrophy. Two sibs with Walker-Warburg syndrome are reported. One sib had congenital glaucoma and hydrocephalus. The other sib had hydrocephalus, microtia, absent auditory canals, and pale retinas, barely within the phenotypic spectrum of the disorder. Elevation of muscle enzymes was consistent with the diagnosis of Walker-Warburg syndrome.
