The merosin M-chain (or laminin-alpha 2) is one of three subunits of laminin-2 which is highly expressed in striated muscle and peripheral nerve. Complete lack of laminin-alpha 2 expression in skeletal muscle is the hallmark of one form of congenital muscular dystrophy which is characterized by dysmyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), links to chromosome 6q2 and is common among Caucasians. Laminin-alpha 2 expression was also found to be significantly reduced in Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy which links to chromosome 9q3. We report consistently preserved laminin-2 expression, including laminin-alpha 2, as detected by immunofluorescence in skeletal muscle from five patients with Walker-Warburg syndrome which is characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy and, in addition, type II lissencephaly or pachygyria, defective CNS myelination, and ocular dysgenesis. These findings show that in spite of partial phenotypic overlap between Fukuyama CMD and Walker-Warburg syndrome the two disorders are nosologically separate disease entities. They also exclude that Walker-Warburg syndrome is allelic to the common form of congenital muscular dystrophy with laminin-alpha 2 deficiency.
