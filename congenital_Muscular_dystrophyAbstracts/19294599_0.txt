We report a family and a single patient in China involved with merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) with typical clinical symptoms. Pathological analysis of biopsied skeletal muscle showed dystrophic changes with proliferated fibrotic tissue elements as the predominant finding. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the complete absence of the laminin alpha2 chain (merosin) around muscle fibers. In patient 1, a double mutation, c.[9101_9104dupAACA:3412G>A] p.[H3035QfsX4:V1138M] was detected, whereas her parents and another sibling were heterozygous carriers. Patient 2 had a novel homozygous nonsense mutation, c.2907C>A (p.Cys969X), in exon 21. The genotype-phenotype correlation of Chinese children with novel merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy is reported.
