Sleep-disordered breathing may occur in a wide variety of neuromuscular syndromes, and may present with diverse, often isolated, symptoms or findings such as excessive daytime sleepiness, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, morning headaches, or hypoxia-induced nocturnal seizures. The authors report two sisters with congenital muscular dystrophy in whom central sleep apnoea resulted in the isolated symptom of nocturnal seizures in one, and morning headaches in the other. Review of the literature reveals that sleep-disordered breathing may be common in neuromuscular disorders, and may often be present when clinical weakness is mild, and insufficient to result in diurnal respiratory dysfunction.
