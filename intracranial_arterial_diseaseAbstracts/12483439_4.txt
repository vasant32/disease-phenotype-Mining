We assessed the clinical utility of the volume-rendering (VR) algorithm as a postprocessing technique of intracranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease in comparison with the maximum intensity projection (MIP) algorithm. VR and MIP images were compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Volume-rendered views improved the perceptibility of intracranial vasculature and consequently augmented diagnostic confidence, improved the characterization of underlying vascular pathologies, and facilitated image interpretation. Volume rendering has the potential to expand the role of cerebral MRA in the diagnostic investigation and treatment planning of cerebrovascular disease.
