PURPOSE: Microembolic signals (MES) can be detected in a variety of clinical situations using conventional transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography. We studied the prevalence of positive MESs in acute stroke patients with intracranial artery stenosis using power M-mode Doppler (PMD) sonography and also tested the feasibility of this new technique. METHOD: Thirty-three consecutive acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack patients with intracranial large artery occlusive disease were enrolled. PMD/TCD monitoring for 30 minutes was used for MES detection downstream of the stenotic artery within 1 week after stroke onset. Clinical risk factors in emboli-positive and emboli-negative patients were assessed. RESULTS: MESs were detected in 21% (7/33) of patients. No significant differences were found in clinical risk factors between emboli-positive and emboli-negative patients. CONCLUSION: PMD sonography to detect MESs in acute stroke patients is feasible and may be used in future clinical trials regarding MES detection.
