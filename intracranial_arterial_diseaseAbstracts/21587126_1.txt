 PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to quantify the amount of brain damage suffered by patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) in which S-100β protein and neuron-specific enolase were used. METHODS: Thirty-four patients undergoing scheduled OPCAB were enrolled in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the results of their magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and cervical ultrasonography: 13 patients had cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis (Group A), and 21 patients did not (Group B). Blood samples were collected from the arterial catheters immediately before surgery, upon arrival to the intensive care unit, and 6 and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS: In blood samples collected from patients upon arrival to the intensive care unit, the maximum concentration of serum s-100β protein in Group A was significantly higher than that of Group B (p = 0.029). Though patients in Group A tended to have higher maximum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) concentrations, there were no significant differences in NSE concentrations at any point between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a correlation between the stenosis detected by MRA or cervical ultrasonography and brain damage after OPCAB.
