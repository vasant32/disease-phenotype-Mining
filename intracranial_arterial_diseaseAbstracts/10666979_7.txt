Reperfusion of intracranial arteries can be detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD). The authors report microembolic signals (MES) on TCD as a sign of clot dissolution and recanalization. Microembolic signals were detected during routine diagnostic TCD examination performed in the emergency room in patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. Microembolic signals were found at the site of M1 middle cerebral artery (MCA) high-grade stenosis or near-occlusion. Transcranial Doppler was performed before, during, and after thrombolytic therapy. Of 16 consecutive patients, 3 (19%) had MES on TCD. All three patients had a severe MCA syndrome at 2 hours after stroke onset scored using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). In patient #1 (NIHSS 12), clusters of MES were detected distal to a high-grade M1 MCA stenosis preceding spontaneous clinical recovery by 2 minutes. Because of subsequent fluctuating clinical deficit, intraarterial thrombolysis was given with complete recovery. In patient #2 (NIHSS 20), TCD detected an M1 MCA near-occlusion. At 1.5 hours after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, TCD showed minimal MCA flow signals followed by MES, increased velocities, and normal flow signals in just 2 minutes. She gradually recovered up to NIHSS 8 in 5 days. In patient #3 with NIHSS 22 and an M1 MCA near-occlusion, TCD detected MES 15 minutes after TPA bolus followed by MCA flow velocity improvement from 15 cm/sec to 30 cm/sec. The patient recovered completely by the end of tissue plasminogen activator infusion. The authors conclude that embolic signals detected by TCD at the site of arterial obstruction can indicate clot dissolution. Intracranial recanalization on TCD can be associated with MES and changes in flow waveform, pulsatility, and velocity if insonation is performed at the site of arterial obstruction.
