TCD recording of flow velocities in intracranial vessels was first described by Aaslid in 1982. The utility of this instrument becomes more apparent as it is used in different clinical settings and compared with angiographic findings (Figures 1 and 2). Its importance in early detection of vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage is now clearly known; increased flow velocity can be documented prior to neurologic deterioration and thus allow early institution of therapy. In patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack of unclear etiology, especially in blacks, Orientals, or females, who have a higher incidence of intracranial arterial disease, TCD can be a very important noninvasive means for detecting stenosis of intracranial vessels. Its value for assessing collateral circulation, intraoperative monitoring, and measuring CBF is quite promising. Hopefully, through further work with TCD, we will be able to clarify the spectrum of its usages as well as its limitations, though the preliminary data indicate that it should be an important addition to present noninvasive evaluations.
