OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence rates of intra- and extracranial large-artery stenosis in the rural community population and its related risk to the development of stroke. METHODS: The study subjects included 1337 residents in the rural community of Beijing. Transcranial Doppler was carried our to examine the relation between intra- and extracranial large-artery stenosis and subsequent cerebrovascular events, with a mean follow-up period of 16.7 months. RESULTS: The incidence densities of cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage in persons without cerebral large-artery stenosis were 410.6 and 351.9/100-thousand person-years, respectively. In the group with large-artery stenosis, the incidence density of cerebral infarction was 3303.7/100-thousand person-years. Data from The Fisher's Exact test showed a significant difference in the two groups (P = 0.004). Cerebral large-artery stenosis (OR = 6.593, 95%CI: 1.712 - 25.390) and smoking (OR = 8.437, 95%CI: 2.327 - 30.598) appeared to be independent risk factors to cerebral infarction. CONCLUSION: Cerebral large-artery stenosis and smoking were independent risk factors to cerebral infarction.
