To investigate the risk factors and treatment outcomes for ischemic stroke in children, we reviewed the charts of 93 children with ischemic stroke seen at our hospital between 1997 and 2006. Age at stroke, sex, medical history, family history, clinical findings upon admission, history of seizure, and radiological findings were recorded. Mean age at onset of the initial stroke was 56.6+/-46.9 months, ranging from 1 month to 14 years. The male:female ratio was 1.6:1. Cardiac and infectious disease were the most common risk factors (37.7%). There were five children (5.4%) who had recurrent stroke and three (3.2%) who had multiple risk factors. Cardiac and infectious causes appeared to be the most important risk factors for ischemic stroke in children in the Adana region of Turkey.
