We describe the risk factors and treatment recommendations of intracerebral haemorrhage, arterial ischaemic stroke, and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis in childhood. The aetiology in children differ a lot from the aetiology in adults, hence guidelines specifically for children have been written. These guidelines build mainly on expert opinions, since only few evidence-based studies exist. Paediatric stroke is one of the major causes of lifelong disability, and the high costs to the families and the society make further research very important.
