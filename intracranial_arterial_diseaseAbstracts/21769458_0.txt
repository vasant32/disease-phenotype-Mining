 BACKGROUND: Concomitant intracranial and visceral artery aneurysms are a rare occurrence. We report the case of a patient who underwent surgical repair of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm but subsequently experienced a ruptured hepatic artery aneurysm in the immediate postoperative period. METHODS: A 59-year-old woman presented with a ruptured posterior communicating artery aneurysm and was treated with coil occlusion. On postoperative day 3, she became hypotensive with a rigid abdomen and was found to have a ruptured hepatic artery aneurysm.                         Rapid transfusion of packed red blood cells was begun, and the patient was taken to the angiography suite where the hepatic artery aneurysm was identified and successfully occluded using detachable coils to prevent further hemorrhage. RESULTS: Recovery was complicated by an ileus and mild pulmonary edema. Over several weeks, neurological status and third nerve paresis improved, with eventual discharge to a subacute rehabilitation center. Subsequent follow-up is notable for recurrence of the intracranial aneurysm, and multiple strictures of right intrahepatic arteries and hepatic ducts. The patient is currently being evaluated for liver transplant, but continues to improve neurologically. CONCLUSION: Prior to this report, there have only been 2 documented cases of concomitant intracranial and visceral artery aneurysms. These reports serve to remind the clinician that intracranial aneurysms may be only part of a systemic pathology, which should be taken into account when unexpected complications arise postoperatively.
