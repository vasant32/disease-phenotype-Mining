Silent cerebral lesions are increasingly found in mass screenings using MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The purpose of this paper is to assess the usefulness of two non-invasive clinical tests-carotid ultrasound examination and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) measurement-for predicting silent cerebral infarction (SCI) and silent intracranial arterial stenosis. Data were collected on 480 asymptomatic adult subjects who participated in a brain screening program at a single hospital between April 2003 and March 2006. All participants underwent baPWV measurement, B-mode ultrasonography of carotid arteries, MRI, and MRA. Data on 476 (99.1%) subjects were included in the analysis. Among these, 273 (57.4%) were male and the mean age was 51.5 years; 161 (33.8%) had carotid plaque; 33 (6.9%) had increased intima-media thickness (IMT); 99 (20.8%) had SCI; and 7 (1.5%) had intracranial arterial stenosis. The multivariate analysis showed that age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.17), carotid plaque (OR: 2.69; 1.59-4.56), increased IMT (OR: 2.40; 1.02-5.65), and a history of hypertension treatment (OR 2.22; 1.11-4.43) were significantly associated with SCI. Also, increased IMT (OR 9.70: 1.48-63.71) was related to intracranial arterial stenosis. Brachial-ankle PWV was related to SCI (p<0.01) and intracranial stenosis (p=0.01) in univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis. The presence of carotid plaque and that of increased IMT on ultrasound examination are useful for assessing the risk of SIC. Increased IMT is also predictive of intracranial arterial stenosis.
