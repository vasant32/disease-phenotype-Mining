 BACKGROUND: An aplastic or twiglike middle cerebral artery (Ap/T-MCA) is an extremely rare congenital anomaly related to interference in the normal embryonic development of the MCA. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and radiological features of patients with an Ap/T-MCA. METHODS: A total of 1749 conventional cerebral angiography procedures were performed in 1282 patients from January 2005 to July 2011 at Daegu Fatima Hospital. The images were evaluated for cerebral arterial anomalies. The radiological features of an Ap/T-MCA, coexisting anomalies, and clinical manifestations were recorded. These prospectively maintained databases were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Ap/T-MCAs were found in 15 patients (1.17% angiographic incidence). The anomalies were confined to unilateral M1 segment, and no stenoses were seen in the adjacent major arteries. Of 15 patients, 6 (40%) had hemorrhagic strokes, 5 (33.3%) had ischemic strokes, and 4 (26.7%) had no symptoms. Aneurysms were found in 5 patients (33.3%). Coexisting cerebral arterial anomalies were seen in 12 patients (80%). Ten patients underwent conservative treatments, and the remaining 5 underwent surgical treatments, such as hematoma aspiration, indirect revascularization, and clipping or coiling of aneurysms. CONCLUSION: An Ap/T-MCA is a rare anomaly and should be differentiated from moyamoya conditions and degenerative steno-occlusive diseases of the middle cerebral artery. Coexisting anomalies of the anterior or middle cerebral arteries are frequent. This anomaly is vulnerable to both hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes.
