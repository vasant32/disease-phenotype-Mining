Arterial large vessel vasculopathy is an unusual complication of bacterial meningitis in adults that may result in cerebral ischemia and severe neurological sequelae. Previous therapy has included antimicrobials with no specific vascular interventions. The authors report their experience with a patient with bacterial meningitis who developed a vasculopathy with neurological deficits. Percutaneous intracranial intervention was used successfully with anatomical and functional improvement.
