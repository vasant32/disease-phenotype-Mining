 BACKGROUND: The limitations of the medical management of symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis encourage the development of new therapeutic strategies such as intracranial stenting. OBJECTIVE: To report and analyze the results of a series of 42 patients treated with 3 different endovascular techniques: isolated angioplasty, balloon-expandable coronary stents, and the Wingspan self-expandable intracranial stent system. METHODS: Forty-two patients presenting with symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis were treated with one of these techniques. Computed tomography angiography was performed 6 months after the procedure, and the clinical neurological statuses were categorized using the modified Rankin Scale and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. RESULTS: A total of 42 lesions were treated: 9 with isolated angioplasty, 14 with balloon-expandable coronary stents, and 19 with Wingspan self-expandable intracranial stents. The mean patient age was 62.9 years, and the mean arterial diameter stenosis was 73.9%. Technical success was achieved in 97.6% of the patients. The overall incidence of procedural complications was 21.4%, and the postoperative permanent morbidity/mortality rate was 7.1%. There were 3 cases of in-stent thrombosis (1 fatal) and 5 cases of asymptomatic restenosis (11.9%), 3 in the isolated angioplasty group and 2 in the Wingspan self-expandable intracranial stent group (mean follow-up 20.4 months). The rate of restenosis was higher in the angioplasty group (33%) than in the coronary (0%) and Wingspan stent (10.5%) groups. CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenosis has significant overall morbidity and mortality rates. Nevertheless, the very critical natural history of severe refractory lesions and the relatively favorable postoperative evolution suggest that it should be considered the first alternative strategy in cases in which medical therapy has failed.
