This work investigated whether turbo magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can replace conventional MRA in screening examination of intracranial arteries. A phantom was used to evaluate the effect of the zero-filling interpolation (ZFI) technique on spatial resolution and partial volume effect. Thirty-one consecutive patients underwent both turbo MRA with a slice thickness of 0.7 mm (data were measured as 1.33 mm sections) and conventional MRA with 1.0 mm sections. In the phantom studies, ZFI did not improve the spatial resolution, but the partial volume effect was somewhat reduced. In the clinical evaluation, turbo MRA showed better signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios of the intracranial major vessels than conventional MRA. The lesions included cerebral aneurysms less than 3 mm in diameter, occlusive vascular disease, arteriovenous malformations, and arteriovenous fistulas. These were all depicted on both turbo MRA and conventional MRA. Turbo MRA is a useful screening procedure because of its capability of delineating lesions in approximately half the usual imaging time. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 1999;10:939-944.
