AIM: To evaluate the influence that steno-occlusive arterial disease may have on the development of early neurological deterioration (END) in a large series of patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We studied a prospective cohort of 1,093 patients admitted to a single tertiary hospital with presence of neurological symptoms in the first 24 h after stroke onset. END was defined as any increase in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score >or=4 points in the first 72 h. The arterial study assessed the presence of arterial occlusion or significative stenosis in the symptomatic territory. Additionally, age, initial stroke severity, blood pressure, glucose levels, vascular risk factors, lacunar stroke and prior use of antithrombotic treatment were also analyzed in a multivariable analysis. RESULTS: END was detected in 179 patients (16.3%). Steno-occlusive disease (adjusted OR 3.60), initial blood pressure and abdominal obesity were independently associated with END. Both arterial stenosis (adjusted OR 2.33) or occlusions (adjusted OR 3.65) were associated with END. The higher adjusted OR (5.49) was obtained for steno-occlusive arterial disease in the vertebrobasilar system. CONCLUSIONS: An early arterial study may provide key data for the selection of patients with higher risk of END after acute ischemic stroke.
