BACKGROUND: The association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and intracranial large artery disease (ICLAD) has been described, but only in cohorts of ethnic Korean patients with stroke. We investigated the relationship of MetS and ICLAD among ethnic Chinese patients. METHODS: This is a prospective study of consecutive ethnic Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke living in Singapore. ICLAD was diagnosed on transcranial color-coded Doppler or magnetic resonance angiography. RESULTS: Among the 135 patients studied, the frequency of MetS was higher among patients with ICLAD (39% v 16%, P = .003). This association was independent of age, hypertension, and diabetes (P = .003), and individual MetS criteria (P = .004). The prevalence of ICLAD positively correlated with the number of MetS criteria fulfilled (P = .021). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of an association between MetS and ICLAD among ethnic Chinese patients with stroke concur with findings among ethnic Korean patients. This validation provides a basis for further investigation into the pathophysiologic link between MetS and ICLAD.
