BACKGROUND: Cortical dysplasias are rarely associated with vascular anomalies. They are usually associated with venous anomalies or in few cases with both arterial and venous anomalies. METHODS: Twenty-six year old female presented with history of headache showed cortical dysplasia associated with pure arterial dysplasia in the absence of any associated venous anomaly. CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal arterial supply to or an abnormal venous drainage from the growing cortex may result in cortical rearrangements that eventually give rise to various neuronal migration anomalies.
