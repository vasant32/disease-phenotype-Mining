Pulmonary arterial and intracranial calcifications are rarely found in children. A female infant, the recipient of a twin-twin transfusion syndrome was found, by ultrasound and computed tomography, to have both pulmonary arterial and intracerebral calcification. A rare condition, termed idiopathic arterial calcification of infancy, is the likely cause. This condition carries a poor prognosis and is usually fatal.
