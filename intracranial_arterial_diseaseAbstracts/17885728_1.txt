OBJECTIVES: Tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis are two of the most common types of chronic meningitis. The study was performed to assess whether the occurrence of intracranial arterial stenosis is a risk factor for poor outcome in tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis. METHODS: The clinical relevance of intracranial arterial stenoses in tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis was studied using transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) over the period of 1 year (2003). A comparison was made between patients with and those without intracranial arterial stenoses during hospitalization. FINDINGS: There were 12 males and three females. Four patients (27%, 4/15) exhibited a stenosis of at least one cerebral artery, of which three had bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis and one had unilateral MCA stenoses. The stenoses were demonstrable during the whole observation period. After 6 months of follow-up, fatality rate was 50% (2/4) in those with intracranial arterial stenosis and 9% (1/11) in those without. Risk of poor outcome at a 6-month endpoint had an odds ratio of 5.3 for patients with intracranial arterial stenoses than those without (reference group). CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial arterial stenoses imply danger of cerebrovascular complications for the treatment of chronic meningitis during hospitalization. This study demonstrates that the frequency of intracranial stenosis in patients affected by chronic meningitis is high (27%) and it may be associated with poorer outcomes.
