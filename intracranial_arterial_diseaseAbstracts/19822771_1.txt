Feeding disorders and the association of neonatal feeding disorders with other outcomes were assessed in a cohort of 84 children with neonatal arterial ischemic stroke at a tertiary children's hospital. Both chi(2) tests and Fisher's exact test were used to test associations. Forty-one of 84 children (48.8%) had feeding difficulties. Infarcted vascular territory (unilateral vs bilateral, P = .24) and neonatal seizures (P = .39) were not associated with feeding problems. Children with at least 1 perinatal comorbidity (P = .002, odds ratio = 4.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.65-11.03) and specifically respiratory problems (P = .004, odds ratio = 3.85; 95% confidence interval: 1.49-9.93) were significantly more likely to have feeding problems. Neonatal feeding problems were predictive of feeding problems at 12 to 24 months of age (P = .026, odds ratio = 3.33; 95% confidence interval: 1.12-9.90) but did not predict speech delay (P = .97) or cerebral palsy (P = .70). Feeding problems are important sequelae of neonatal stroke, but neonatal feeding problems in this group do not predict speech delay or cerebral palsy.
