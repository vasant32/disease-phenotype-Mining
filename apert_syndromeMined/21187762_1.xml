<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous well-documented techniques are available for airway management in this group of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our center, the nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) is the first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the improvement in health-related quality of life in this group of children using the Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective postal study of 24 patients with craniofacial disorders who had an NPA inserted as part of their airway management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 79.2% (n = 19) response rate was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean (SD) age was 5.8 (4.1) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into 3 main groups: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> (n = 11), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> (n = 6), and Pfeiffer (n = 2) syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was improvement in 3 of the 4 domains, namely, learning (P = 0.006), vitality (P = 0.003), physical (range, -3 to 8; mean, 2; P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was significant improvement in the sleep study parameters; however, no correlation was found between this and the Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Parents also preferred an NPA as opposed to a tracheostomy when given a choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that NPA confers significant improvement not only in health-related quality of life but also in severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> as judged by sleep study parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The NPA is also well tolerated by patients and is much preferred by parents for airway management for their children as opposed to having a tracheostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We think that this should be considered in other centers as first-line management in children with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
