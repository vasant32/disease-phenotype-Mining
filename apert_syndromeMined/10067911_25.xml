<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> is characterized by faciocraniosynostosis and severe bony and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010554'>cutaneous syndactyly</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis for this syndrome appears remarkably specific: two adjacent amino acid substitutions (either S252W or P253R) occurring in the linking region between the second and third immunoglobulin domains of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to examine the phenotype/genotype correlations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study, 36 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> were screened for genetic mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one of the patients there was a rare mutation consisting of a double-base pair substitution in the same codon (S252F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A phenotypical survey of our cases was performed and showed the clinical variability of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients there was no clinical or radiological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two other patients with atypical forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> and cranial abnormalities, the detection of a specific mutation was helpful in making the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The P253R mutation appears to be associated with the more severe forms, with regard to the forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> and to mental outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The fact that mutations found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>' s syndrome are usually confined to a specific region of the FGFR2 exon IIIa may be useful in making the diagnosis and allowing genetic counseling in difficult cases </plain></SENT>
