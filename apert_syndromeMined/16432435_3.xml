<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The systems provide rigid fixation while potentially minimizing the long-term drawbacks of permanent plating systems such as plate "migration," bone growth restriction, and imaging artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the need for active plate resorption represents both the strength and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of these fixation systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present four patients who underwent cranial vault remodeling using a resorbable plating system, following which the plates were palpable and observable for at least 2 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> required surgical removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On gross inspection, the plates had been replaced by an encapsulated spongy material containing yellow, grainy, cloudy liquid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bone underlying the plates was depressed and irregular in contour when compared with the adjacent bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microscopic studies showed a giant cell foreign-body reaction with crystalline material present in the cell vacuoles </plain></SENT>
