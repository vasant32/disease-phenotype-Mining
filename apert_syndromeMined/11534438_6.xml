<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high risk morbidity limited its use to major exorbitism or severe breathing impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a preliminary experience in five children with a mean age of 3.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> or Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure performed was a frontofacial monobloc osteotomy with peroperative mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two pairs of distractors (Martin-Medizin) were implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The upper pair of frontal distractors was located behind the supraorbital bar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pair of temporo-zygomatic distractors (a modification of the MicroFrance prototypes) was implanted behind the zygomatic bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one patient a transfacial pin was connected to the anterior part the lower distractors, to avoid facial bipartition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Distraction was performed according to classical protocols with a 1 mm advancement per day, until sufficient advancement was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correction of exorbitism and facial retrusion was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0010807'>open-bite</z:hpo> was created by the advancement in two out of the five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> occurred in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This combination of distractors with frontofacial advancement seemed to increase the efficacy and reduce the morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This might lead to a one stage strategy for faciocraniosynostosis treatment, even if minor additive procedures will be necessary when children get older and that insufficient facial growth still reoccurs </plain></SENT>
