<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intragenic mutations of the TWIST gene within 7p21 have been identified as a cause of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is phenotypic overlap with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes, and intragenic mutations in FGFR2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) and FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) have been demonstrated in the other conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, complete gene deletions of TWIST have also been found in a significant proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated 11 patients clinically identified as having the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype and 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> but without a clear diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype, four were found to carry the FGFR3 P250R mutation, three were found to be heterozygous for three different novel mutations in the coding region of TWIST, and two were found to have a deletion of one copy of the entire TWIST gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>Developmental delay</z:hpo> was a distinguishing feature of the patients with deletions, compared to patients with intragenic mutations of TWIST, in agreement with the results of Johnson et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>[1998: Am J Hum Genet 63:1282-1293] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found for the four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> without a clear diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 9 of our 11 patients (82%) with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype had detectable genetic changes in FGFR3 or TWIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that initial screening for the FGFR3 P250R mutation, followed by sequencing of TWIST and then fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for deletion detection of TWIST, is sufficient to detect mutations in &gt; 80% of patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype </plain></SENT>
