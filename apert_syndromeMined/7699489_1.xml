<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The results of monobloc (MB) or facial bipartition (FB) osteotomies on 23 consecutive patients operated on between 1987 and 1991 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A previously described method of clinically relevant linear measurements taken from preoperative and postoperative computed tomographic scans of these patients was used to document their presenting dysmorphology and the results of surgical correction initially and 1 year after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data were compared with control values, and a percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for each measurement was derived for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> undergoing an MB osteotomy, the initial cranial vault length (87% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), medial orbital wall length (87%), zygomatic arch length (84%), and extent of globe protrusion (134%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indicated horizontal (anterior-posterior) deficiency of the upper and middle face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After surgery, these measurements moved closer to age-matched control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the 1-year interval a minor degree of relapse was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> who were believed to need an FB osteotomy, the globe protrusion (142% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), medial orbital wall length (85%), and zygomatic arch lengths (83%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indicated horizontal (anterior-posterior) deficiency in the upper and middle face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the anterior interorbital distance (123% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), mid-interorbital distance (122%), and intertemporal distance (126%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indicated upper face <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result of the FB osteotomy, anterior bony projection was achieved, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> was improved, but fell short of age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the patients with frontonasal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, cranio-orbital clefting, and isolated orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> who underwent an FB osteotomy, preoperative measurements showed a distinct widening of the whole upper midface with forward projection of the medial relative to the lateral orbital walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The orbital measurements revealed a substantially widened anterior interorbital distance (175% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), increased mid-interorbital distance (123%), and an increased distance between the lateral orbital walls (106%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After the surgical procedure, these measurements were improved and relatively stable but not completely normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of quantitative measurements in the initial evaluation, intraoperative skeletal reshaping, and assessment of early and late reconstructive results provides useful benchmarks </plain></SENT>
