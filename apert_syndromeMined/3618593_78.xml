<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A statistical analysis of parental age and the incidence of new mutation has been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some new data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, and Pfeiffer syndromes is presented and combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available data from the literature on parental age and new mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among syndromes for the rate of increase in incidence with parental age was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A parsimonious conclusion is that mutations fall into two groups, one with a high rate of increase with age and the other with a low rate of increase with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the high-rate-of-increase group, a linear model relating incidence to age is rejected, while an exponential model is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, for this group, increased paternal age cannot account for the observed increase in maternal age--that is, increased maternal age also contributes to the incidence of new mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the low-rate-of-increase group, increased paternal age alone can account for the observed increase in maternal ages; also, either a linear or exponential model is acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is no evidence for a mixture of parental age-independent cases with parental age-dependent cases for any of the syndromes examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The curves reflecting incidence of new mutation and paternal age for two syndromes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo>, have an anomalous shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both cases the curve increases up to age 37 and drops at age 42 before increasing again at age 47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The usual explanation for the effect of parental age on new mutations is the mechanism of "copy-error" at mitotic division in male sperone that specifies an increased probability of mutation with time spent by a spermatozoon or ovum in a haploid state, a period of time that may also increase with age of the parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A firm answer to the question of parental age and new mutation awaits identification of the molecular defect underlying some of these syndromes; we will then be in a position to determine in which parent the mutation occurred and at what age it did so </plain></SENT>
