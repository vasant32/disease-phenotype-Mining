<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the dysmorphological variability and to investigate the presence of mutations in the exon 1 of TWIST gene using direct sequencing in Brazilian families presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome (SCS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four families with 24 patients diagnosed as having features of SCS were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were inventoried </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The investigation protocol included anamnesis, dysmorphological examination, abdominal ultrasound, spine and cranium x-ray, chromosomal analysis on GTG banding, and screening for mutations in the exon 1 of TWIST gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequent facial features included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> (24 of 24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000324'>facial asymmetry</z:hpo> (20 of 24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000412'>prominent ears</z:hpo> crus (15 of 24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000369'>low-set ears</z:hpo> (14 of 24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000327'>maxillary hypoplasia</z:hpo> (13 of 24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000426'>prominent nasal bridge</z:hpo> (13 of 24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> of the eyelids (12 of 24), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000294'>low-set frontal hairline</z:hpo> (12 of 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002813'>Limb abnormalities</z:hpo> such as partial hand <z:hpo ids='HP_0010554'>cutaneous syndactyly</z:hpo> (18 of 24), <z:mp ids='MP_0006253'>clinodactyly</z:mp> (13 of 24), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010055'>broad great toes</z:hpo> (13 of 24), and partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0010554'>cutaneous syndactyly</z:hpo> of the feet (9 of 24) were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among radiological findings were relevant bicoronal (eight of nine) and unicoronal (one of nine) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, digital impressions (eight of nine), bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002697'>parietal foramina</z:hpo> (two of nine), partial fusion 1 and 2 degrees costal arches (two of nine) and bifid spine on lumbar vertebra (two of nine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GTG-banding chromosomal analyses were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No TWIST gene mutations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Affected individuals in these four SCS families may carry mutations in other genes of the same developmental pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering the complexity of the genes involved in skull-limbs development, an accurate dysmorphological evaluation in patients with SCS and their families is especially important for genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
