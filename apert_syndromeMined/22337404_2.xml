<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: During the 1970s, frontofacial advancement revolutionized the treatment of severe facial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, this method was associated with significant morbidity due to the Le Fort III osteotomy, which creates a major communication between the frontocranial dead space and the nasal fossae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Midfacial distraction improves the complication rate by diminishing the size of this gap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to present an original technique that uses external distraction frames and eliminates the need for Le Fort osteotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This innovative technique eliminates the gap between the skull and nose, thus avoiding related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 2008, we operated on 17 patients presenting midfacial retrusion and maxillomandibular class III <z:hpo ids='HP_0000689'>malocclusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed classic fronto-orbital advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only facial osteotomies are vertical cuts of both the lateral orbital wall and the zygomatic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distraction device is then anchored posteriorly with a K-wire and anteriorly with a transfacial pin through the maxilla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the distraction is performed horizontally until a class II overcorrection is obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No life-threatening complications or mortalities occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the midfacial retrusion was corrected without relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with complications fully recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It was observed that most complications were a result of either an overly rapid activation (&gt;1 mm/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Midface distraction using the external transfacial pin is a simple and safe procedure that allows an efficient correction of major facial retrusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The external transfacial pin acts directly onto the maxilla and allows distraction without Le Fort osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>By eliminating major osteotomies, it reduces the number of severe complications encountered in craniofacial surgery </plain></SENT>
