<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple FGFR2 splice variants are generated through alternative splicing, including PTC (premature termination codon)-containing transcripts that are normally eliminated via the NMD (nonsense-mediated decay) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have discovered that a soluble truncated FGFR2 molecule encoded by a PTC-containing transcript is up-regulated and persists in tissues of an AS mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have termed this IIIa-TM as it arises from aberrant splicing of FGFR2 exon 7 (IIIa) into exon 10 [TM (transmembrane domain)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IIIa-TM is glycosylated and can modulate the binding of FGF1 to FGFR2 molecules in BIAcore-binding assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that IIIa-TM can negatively regulate FGF signalling in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AS phenotypes are thought to result from gain-of-FGFR2 signalling, but our findings suggest that IIIa-TM can contribute to these through a loss-of-FGFR2 function mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our findings raise the interesting possibility that FGFR2 signalling may be a regulator of the NMD pathway </plain></SENT>
