<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Selected family histories and recorded events during pregnancy are also reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sex ratio is 1:1 (60 males, 59 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 94 pedigrees except one (an affected father and daughter) represent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combining our cases with those available in the literature, only nine familial instances are known to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The familial cases, the equal number of affected males and females, and the increased paternal age in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases strongly suggest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rarity of familial instances can be explained by reduced genetic fitness of affected individuals because severe malformations and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental deficiency</z:hpo>, found in many cases, diminish desirability as mates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The variability of the syndrome has been defined mainly on the basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
