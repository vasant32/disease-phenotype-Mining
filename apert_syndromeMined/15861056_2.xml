<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients who had undergone <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> correction by facial bipartition were retrospectively studied to analyze the role of three-dimensional computed tomographic reconstruction in the evaluation of the deformity and preoperative planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The procedure and surgical details that can improve the outcome were described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A reproducible set of three-dimensional measurements that can help in preoperative patient evaluation was determined based on information obtained using the Analyze/AVW 3.1 system (Biomedical Imaging Resource, Mayo Foundation, Rochester, Minn.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this series, the most common diagnosis was frontonasal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (64.3 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients had second-degree (35.7 percent) and nine had third-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> (64.3 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three-dimensional scans were shown to be highly accurate in predicting the degree of deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the preoperative and postoperative interdacryon distance and midface height (p &lt; 0.05) but not in the bitemporal distance (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The simulation correlated significantly with the postoperative result when interdacryon distance and midface height were analyzed (0.736 and 0.999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Facial bipartition provided a three-dimensional correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional imaging can definitely be considered an extra tool for accurate surgical planning and helping the family understand the surgical procedure and the end result </plain></SENT>
