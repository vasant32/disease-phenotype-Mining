<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The goal of this study was to elucidate the genotype-phenotype relationship in syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e> by analyzing the mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene and its clinical manifestations in patients, particularly those in atypical cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e> unrelated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes indicated the following syndromes: 12 patients with unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, including nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and three familial cases; two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Pfeiffer syndrome; and one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265307" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Antley-Bixler syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> phenotype was subdivided into three clinical forms: regular, top, and bottom ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients who demonstrated craniofacial anomalies and bilateral elbow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo> were categorized as having an unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three cases of unclassifiable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> malformation were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen mutations of the FGFR2 gene were identified in these patients; seven of the 10 cysteine-related mutations were substitutions of codon 342 in the third immunoglobulin-like domain of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes of these seven cases were three of regular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, two of unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, and one each of top <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and unclassifiable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, four of the seven patients were found to have the same genotype (Cys342Arg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes of these patients, however, were quite variable, ranging from regular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> to unclassifiable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e> unrelated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> proved quite variable, even in cases in which patients demonstrated the same genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In view of the phenotypic diversity evident in cases in which the same mutation in the FGFR2 gene is present, it is possible that other disease-modifying genetic factors exist to control the abnormal gain-of-function that accompanies FGFR signaling </plain></SENT>
