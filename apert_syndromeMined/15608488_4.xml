<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is currently uncertainty whether a worse neurosurgical outcome occurs in association with a particular genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether there were clinically subtle (but relevant) morphological differences in the craniofacial skeleton, which would result in differences in the intracranial volume, which might account for apparent differences in surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Three-dimensional CT scans of pre-operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> whose genotype had been identified had the intracranial volume measured using the Cavalieri estimator with correction for partial voluming effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The values were compared to age and sex <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and then the two genotypes compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracranial volumes were measured for 22 cases, 16 with the 252 mutation and 6 with the 253 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases except two had greater than their sex- and age-adjusted mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the 252 and 253 genotypes there were no discernible differences in intracranial volumes between the two genotypes </plain></SENT>
