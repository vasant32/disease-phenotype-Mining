<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previously, we have reported the pattern of temperature increase after transcranial surgery for nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> had a bimodal distribution during the first 48 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aims of this study were to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> after transcranial surgery for syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> (Pfeiffer syndrome), to investigate whether the same pattern occurred, and to evaluate the correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> and possible factors, that is, sex, age, procedure, length of surgery, and incidence of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twenty-one sequential case notes of Pfeiffer syndrome were retrospectively reviewed to collect 38 postoperative temperature courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean change of temperature was plotted on a graph with a trend line to find the feature of the course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Pyrexia</z:hpo> after transcranial surgery for Pfeiffer syndrome had a bimodal distribution during the first 48 hours, similar to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> after transcranial surgery for nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> was higher and more prolonged in those undergoing a longer surgical procedure and frontofacial advancement and procedures accompanied with postoperative CSF leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the temperature course was more complex in procedures accompanied with postoperative CSF leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that in Pfeiffer syndrome, which has more complicated pathologic status than nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, also had bimodal postoperative temperature course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of the bimodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> remains unclear, it seems that it is part of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> postoperative course in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, prolonged raised temperature within the first 48 postoperative hours may suggest a complication </plain></SENT>
