<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the TWIST 1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to delineate functional features separating SCS from Muenke's syndrome, we screened patients presenting with coronal suture <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> for mutations in the TWIST 1 gene, and for the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within a total of 124 independent pedigrees, 39 (71 patients) were identified to carry 25 different mutations of TWIST 1 including 14 novel mutations, to which six whole gene deletions were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 71 patients were compared with 42 subjects from 24 pedigrees carrying the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3 and 65 subjects from 61 pedigrees without a detectable mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Classical SCS associated with a TWIST 1 mutation could be separated phenotypically from the Muenke phenotype on the basis of the following features: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000294'>low-set frontal hairline</z:hpo>, gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> of eyelids, subnormal ear length, dilated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002697'>parietal foramina</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000571'>interdigital webbing</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001822'>hallux valgus</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0010055'>broad great toe</z:hpo> with bifid distal phalanx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional differences were even more important: intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as a consequence of early progressive multisutural fusion was a significant problem in SCS only, while mental delay and <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> were associated with the Muenke's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrary to previous reports, SCS patients with complete loss of one TWIST allele showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mental development </plain></SENT>
