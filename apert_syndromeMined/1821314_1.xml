<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A team approach is required to achieve effective patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The team evaluation begins shortly after birth and follows the patient through infancy, childhood, and adolescence into early adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of each team member varies according to the patient's age and individual circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, in infancy and early childhood, constant combined reassessment by the pediatrician, neurosurgeon, ophthalmologist, neuroradiologist, and craniofacial surgeon is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Later in adolescence, the role of the ophthalmologist, neuroradiologist, and neurosurgeon becomes less important, whereas that of the orthodontist, speech pathologist, maxillofacial surgeon, and psychosocial team becomes more dominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major craniofacial centers should be encouraged to develop protocols for patient management and to follow a consistent prospective process of collecting data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meeting these objectives allows us to learn from the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the past decade since the introduction of the modern era of craniofacial surgery by Tessier in 1967, craniomaxillofacial surgery has advanced in many ways: through the use of autogenous cranial bone grafts for onlay or interpositional use; refinements in bone stabilization techniques that include miniplate and microplate and screw fixation rather than direct wires; the reintroduction of creative osteotomies for the management of midface deficiency (monobloc and monobloc bipartition); the development of CT scanning techniques applied to the craniofacial skeleton for both qualitative and quantitative measurement; and the presence of the dedicated craniofacial anesthetist whose meticulous monitoring, airway management, and fluid replacement allows for the safe execution of complex total midface osteotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recognition of the need for a staged surgical approach to the correction of the deformities caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>'s and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndromes</z:e> has clarified reconstructive goals and allowed the surgeon to take advantage of differential craniofacial growth patterns similar to those used to help the patient with congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By continuing to define our rationale for the timing of surgical intervention--for example, using cranial vault surgery in infancy to relieve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>; total midface advancement in childhood to further increase intracranial and orbital volume, improve nasal airflow, occlusion, and body image; and orthognathic surgery in adolescence to improve occlusion, speech, and aesthetics--we can avoid unproductive surgery and select the optimal timing for surgical intervention to maximize long-term functional and aesthetic results </plain></SENT>
