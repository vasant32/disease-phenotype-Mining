<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to assess the utility and reliability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in antenatal diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the MRI examinations of the head of 15 fetuses requested over a period of 11 years on the basis of sonographic suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The postnatal diagnosis was available for 14 neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No termination of pregnancy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were four neonates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> multisuture <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e>, three of which were syndromic, including one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and one Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight neonates were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, two showed cranial vault deformities without <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp>, and one was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI showed a high predictive value for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, as there were no false-negative or false-positive diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the severity of the abnormalities were underestimated in two neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that prenatal MRI has diagnostic value when <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> is suspected on ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, MRI is accurate in the detection of associated brain abnormalities, which is an important prognostic issue in this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prenatal diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> is difficult and could benefit from three-dimensional ultrasonography and three-dimensional CT </plain></SENT>
