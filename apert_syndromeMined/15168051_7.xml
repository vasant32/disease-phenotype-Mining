<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Various surgical techniques for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> using distraction devices have been described over the last few years and we have applied these procedures in seven patients with varying types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this report is to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of these surgical methods and to discuss current concepts for the surgical strategy in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2001 to March 2003, 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 7 patients, 5 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon disease</z:e>, and 1 with multiple-<z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp>, underwent surgical treatment using the distraction method with internal distraction devices, according to our treatment strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent preoperative and postoperative evaluations, which included the patient's neurological state, developmental quotient (DQ), and three-dimensional CT (3D-CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The timing of the procedures undertaken was between the ages of 1 year 5 months and 12 years 6 months (mean age 4 years 11 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients had received previous treatment and this procedure was used as a secondary operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative distraction distances varied from 7 to 20.5 mm (mean distraction distance: 14 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory cranial volume expansion and aesthetically pleasing morphological states were achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regarding complications, one patient required re-operation because of dislocation of the device and <z:hpo ids='HP_0200041'>skin erosion</z:hpo> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> around the penetrated wound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, in a second patient a distortion of the device occurred, but no re-operation was needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The advantage of the distraction method is its applicability for Toddler or Elder Children Calvarial Reconstruction to correct cosmetic and functional problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One disadvantage is the difficulty in using it for Infantile Calvarial Normalization because of thin calvarial bones and the necessity for re-operation to remove the device, which may result in it becoming a "fixation procedure," essentially contraindicated for the fast-developing brain and calvarias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the efficacy of this procedure is that the many advantages outweigh the disadvantages as sufficient calvarial expansion and good results using the distraction method, especially in toddler and elder children age groups, can be achieved </plain></SENT>
