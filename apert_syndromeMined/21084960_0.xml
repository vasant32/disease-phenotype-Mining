<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There have been very few small studies or case reports in the literature considering noninvasive postmortem imaging as supplement to autopsy, especially in fetuses with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> accounts for 4.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with craniosynostotic syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is classically characterized by the triad of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004440'>coronal craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, midfacial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, and symmetric bony <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> of the hands and feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Illustrate the accuracy of a postmortem computed tomography compared with a conventional autopsy as well as review common imaging findings in a case of prenatally diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 31-year-old woman was seen for a routine prenatal ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A craniofacial syndrome was suspected by prenatal ultrasound, and the anomalies raised the suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After genetic counseling, it was chosen to terminate the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A postmortem computed tomographic scan was performed, followed by a conventional autopsy that confirmed the findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Computed tomography provides many advantages in postmortem assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postmortem imaging cannot replace conventional autopsy but is superior in axial and appendicular skeleton assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies provide supplemental information that may guide the autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In situations where the parents wish not to pursue an autopsy, postmortem imaging can provide useful clinical information </plain></SENT>
