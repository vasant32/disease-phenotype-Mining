<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This two-part study reviews data from a recently developed colony of New Zealand white rabbits with familial, nonsyndromic unilateral coronal suture <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Part 1 presents pathological findings and compensatory sutural growth data from 109 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbits and 82 craniosynostotic rabbits from this colony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Synostotic foci, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and progression were described in the calvariae from 102 staged (fetal days 21, 25, 27, 33; term = 30 days) fetuses (39 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 63 synostosed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calvarial suture growth patterns from 10 to 126 days of age were assessed from serial radiographs obtained from 89 rabbits (70 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbits and 19 rabbits with unicoronal suture <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp>) with amalgam bone marker implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perinatal results revealed that by fetal day 25 the synostotic focal point in synostotic rabbits consistently originated from the endocortical surface of the calvaria in the middle of the coronal suture at a presumed high-tension, interdigitating zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis revealed hyperostotic osteogenic fronts on the affected side compared with the unaffected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postnatal sutural growth data revealed a predictable pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>plagiocephaly</z:hpo> (contralateral coronal sutures growing more than ipsilateral sutures and ipsilateral frontonasal and anterior lambdoidal sutures growing more than contralateral sutures), which resulted in early cranial vault deformities and a double "S" shape torquing towards the affected side </plain></SENT>
