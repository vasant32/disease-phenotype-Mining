<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type 2 Pfeiffer syndrome is a condition associated with premature fusion of multiple cranial sutures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> (kleeblatsch√§del deformity), prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo>, thumb and first toe abnormalities, variable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo>, and mutated genes for type 1 or 2 fibroblast growth factor receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These children generally do poorly because of significant often severe neurologic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive defects</z:hpo>, and many die very young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Roughly half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with Pfeiffer syndrome, and virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with type 2 disease, also have type 1 CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> may not be congenital but acquired as a consequence of the skull deformities and other associated intracranial factors in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report a term male infant with type 2 Pfeiffer syndrome, who was not noted to have any CM on initial brain imaging done at 2 months but in whom repeated imaging demonstrated clear evidence of CM by 4 months, despite reconstructive craniotomies and unilateral ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Posterior fossa decompression yielded a good result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This patient provides further evidence to support the concept of acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The etiology seems multifactorial and related to (1) the disproportionately slow growth of the skull relative to the brain, particularly in the posterior fossa, secondary to early fusion of skull sutures, in turn secondary to congenital deficiencies in fibroblast growth factor receptors; (2) impaired venous sinus drainage; (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>; and (4) resultant elevations in intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
