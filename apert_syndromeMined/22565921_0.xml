<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study on the stability of Le Fort III midface advancement with distraction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six surgical procedures for midface advancement were performed between 2000 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 14 consecutive patients who underwent Le Fort III osteotomy with midface advancement using a rigid external distraction device (Synthes) in the Dep of Maxillo-Facial Surgery of the University "Sapienza" of Rome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, 8 patients (n = 3 females, n = 5 males) affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, n = 5; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, n = 3; Pfeiffer syndrome, n = 1; and other, n = 1) were selected on the basis of age and radiologic documentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the time of the procedure was 8.6 years, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients had at least 1 year of follow-up after distraction.The radiologic documentation of each case was composed of posteroanterior and lateral cephalograms preoperatively (T1), at the time of removal of the distractor device (T2), and at follow-up (T3).The average latency period before activation of the distractor was 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The device was activated on an average of 15 mm (range, 7-22 mm) as recorded on the device at a rate of 1 mm/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activation period ranged from 7 to 15 days, and the consolidation period was 8 to 12 weeks.Seven anatomic landmarks and 5 cephalometric measurements were identified on the lateral cephalograms at each of the 3 time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cephalograms underwent digital analysis via Dolphin imaging digitalization software by 2 operators independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The displacement of each identified landmark was recorded and examined in relation to their position at each time point.Cephalometric analysis revealed stability of Le Fort III midface advancement during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, bone growth after midface advancement is limited, and as reported in the literature, almost no spontaneous growth is present because of the intrinsic nature of malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients treated in the growing age benefit from midface advancement, with resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo>, ocular bulb exposure, airway impairment, and good aesthetic outcome </plain></SENT>
