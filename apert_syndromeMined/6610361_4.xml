<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This imbalance in the facial profile is generally attributed to the diminished growth of the maxilla, thereby increasing the disparity between maxilla and mandible with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>What is not known is whether the mandible is, indeed, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous work by Kreiborg with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> led to the conclusion that the mandible, although somewhat smaller, grew in a "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our own observations, which used a greater variety of mandibular measurements on patients with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndromes</z:e>, corroborated Kreiborg 's conclusions but go further to suggest a syndrome-specific mandibular malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ramal height was found equal to the norm and sometimes greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mandibular body length was significantly shorter, thereby producing a distinctly different ramus/body length ratio, particularly in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings become significant in the planning of reconstructive procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They also raise the question as to whether the shape of the mandible is genetic in origin or is an adaptation to the increasing derangements of the cranial base, maxilla, and occlusion observed with maturation in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possibility of interactive genetic and environmental factors affecting growth of the mandible emerges from the data </plain></SENT>
