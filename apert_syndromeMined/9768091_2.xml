<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several biological materials have been analyzed in combination with osteo-inductive growths factors to determine whether such a system can replace bone grafting in surgical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efforts have been aimed at the discovery of the best carriers and delivery systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the results of the surgical treatment of 11 cranio-maxillo-facial defects in 9 patients using a combination of natural coral skeleton (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> in blocks or granules), human fibrin glue and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta 1) as a composite bone substitute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients were initially excluded because of early extrusion of the materials due to a technical error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiological evaluation was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, with the patient acting as his own control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical firmness and radiological mineralization occurred in three quarters of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New bone formation was confirmed histologically in two of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically the initial results remained stable over a three years follow-up with staged surgical procedures performed on a number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients suffered any detrimental effect from implantation of the bone substitute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the numbers in these series are limited, the association of TGF-beta 1, human fibrin glue and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> represented an interesting step, although the clinical results could be improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Important factors in the success of this technique appeared to be stabilisation of the biological materials, quality and asepsis of the surrounding tissue and the dose of growth factor </plain></SENT>
