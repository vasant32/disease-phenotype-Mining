<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By this method we have treated 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000263'>oxycephaly</z:hpo> since 1973, with good results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have also operated on babies with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e> to try to solve simultaneously the functional and the cosmetic problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In faciocraniostenosis, there are dominant malformations at the base of the skull, but an isolated frontal advancement of two cm has produced gratifying early results </plain></SENT>
