<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the role of cadherins and signaling events in the phenotypic alterations induced by the Ap FGFR-2 S252W mutation in mutant immortalized fetal human calvaria osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FGFR-2 mutation caused increased expression of the osteoblast markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP), type 1 collagen (COLIA1), and osteocalcin (OC) in long-term culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutation also increased cell-cell aggregation, which was suppressed by specific neutralizing anti-N- and anti-E-cadherin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutant osteoblasts showed increased N- and E-cadherin, but not N-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (N-CAM) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed in vivo by the abundant immunoreactive N- and E-cadherins in preosteoblasts in the Ap suture whereas N-CAM and alpha- and beta-catenins were unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutralizing anti-N-cadherin antibody or N-cadherin antisense (AS) oligonucleotides but not anti-E-cadherin antibody or AS reduced ALP activity as well as ALP, COLIA1, and OC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression in mutant osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of signal transduction revealed increased phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) and protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) phosphorylation and increased PKC activity in mutant cells in basal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of PKC by calphostin C or the PKCalpha-specific inhibitor GÃ¶6976 suppressed the increased N-cadherin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels as well as the overexpression of ALP, COLIA1, and OC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in mutant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, N-cadherin plays a role in the activation of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in mutant osteoblasts and PKCalpha signaling appears to be involved in the increased N-cadherin and osteoblast gene expression induced by the S252W FGFR-2 mutation in human osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
