<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with syndromic and complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> have various physical and mental problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More insight on these problems, per syndrome, could provide guidance to improve patient treatment and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional, comparative study on 131 patients and their parents was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Health-related quality of life was measured with the HUI-3 and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were compared to a normative Dutch population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vision, hearing and intelligence were objectively measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HUI-3 and the VAS were significant lower compared to the normative Dutch population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> syndromes have a high prevalence of vision and speech problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cognitive problems were mainly reported in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and Muenke syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ambulation and dexterity problems were seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, Saethre-Chotzen and complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> scored significantly worse on pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The HUI-3 had a medium to strong correlation with the objectively measured outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall quality of life is lower in patients with syndromic and complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To improve quality of life, more attention is needed for problems with vision and speech </plain></SENT>
