<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen cranio-orbito-zygomatic variables were measured and repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Means and standard deviations were computed for each sex, and means were pooled since they were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation coefficients for repeat measures (intra-observer error) of each variable showed good reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only the lateral orbital wall angle differed between the syndromes (p = .034), suggesting that upper facial differences (as measured by these variables) do not manifest themselves at this young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measurements for both syndromes, except one, were outside the 95 percent confidence range for age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements taken from standard CT scans provide an objective comparison between specific syndromes and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
