<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Midface distraction osteogenesis (DO) in craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e>) patients has been described by several authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, very few cephalometric and computed tomography (CT) long-term follow-up studies are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 40 consecutive patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e> subjected to Le Fort III and rigid external distraction (RED) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had pre-DO cephalometric records, immediately post-DO and 6-12 months post-DO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients had mid-term records (3 years post-DO) and 20 patients had long-term records (5-10 years post-DO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had CT data within 1-year of DO, while 10 patients had long-term CT data (range 5-9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Excellent post-surgical stability was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short- and long-term CT data demonstrated excellent ossification at the osteotomy sites post-DO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the growing patients, surface resorption in the zygomatic-temporal and in the subspinal area (p &lt; 0.05) was observed in the long-term follow-up, as well as a mild increment of the corrected exorbitism (p &lt; 0.05), as only appositional and no sutural growth occurs post Le Fort III, whereby orbital volume does not increase after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significant advancement of the midface can be achieved and maintained through Le Fort III and RED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the long term, in growing patients, in general a class III <z:hpo ids='HP_0000689'>malocclusion</z:hpo> does not re-occur, but physiological remodelling processes at the maxillary-zygomatic level, not coupled with sutural growth, tend to mildly re-express the original midfacial phenotype and the exorbitism </plain></SENT>
