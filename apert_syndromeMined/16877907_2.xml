<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Midface advancement, either with a Le Fort III or concomitantly to a monobloc frontofacial advancement, may prevent a tracheotomy or result in its ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amelioration of respiratory function appears to be much better if the midface advancement is combined with distraction osteogenesis, although large studies with long-term follow-up are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we reviewed the respiratory outcome between Le Fort III with distraction and monobloc advancement with distraction in 54 faciocraniosynostotic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early respiratory results of both procedures were very good and stable at long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The choice between a Le Fort III and a monobloc procedure is made on the basis of presenting <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, previous surgery, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both can be expected to give a long-lasting improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
