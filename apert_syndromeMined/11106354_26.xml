<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it was shown that loss of function mutations in the MSX2 homeobox gene on chromosome 5 are responsible for the presence of these lesions in some FPP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the absence of MSX2 mutations in some of the FPP patients analysed and the presence of FPP associated with chromosome 11p deletions in DEFECT 11 (OMIM 601224) patients or associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> suggests <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> for this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Starting from a BAC/P1/cosmid contig of the DEFECT 11 region on chromosome 11, we have now isolated the ALX4 gene, a previously unidentified member of the ALX homeobox gene family in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of the ALX4 gene in three unrelated FPP families without the MSX2 mutation identified mutations in two families, indicating that mutations in ALX4 could be responsible for these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001362'>skull defects</z:hpo> and suggesting further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of FPP </plain></SENT>
