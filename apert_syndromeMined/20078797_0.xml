<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The number of publications on the oral features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated dental tissues in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> histologically, to determine the nature and extent of anomalies, to provide some insight into the nature of the condition, and to explain how observed anomalies may affect the dental management of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: Extracted primary and secondary teeth were collected from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> who had attended the Australian Craniofacial Unit, Adelaide, South Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total study sample comprised 13 individuals, aged from 14 to 21 , with nine men and four women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 40 teeth were available for histological examination (the number belonging to each individual varied from 2 to 5 per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The teeth were sectioned longitudinally, and one-half of each tooth underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_48'>decalcification</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sections were stained with H&amp;E for routine histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ground sections were prepared from undecalcified tooth halves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histological assessment of the dental hard tissues revealed an intact enamel and dentinal structure but some irregularities were noted in the region of the dentino-enamel junction (DEJ), which could affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> progression and also make dental management more difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study identified histological anomalies of the DEJ of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> teeth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An improved appreciation of the nature and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000164'>dental anomalies</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> should assist clinicians when undertaking management of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
