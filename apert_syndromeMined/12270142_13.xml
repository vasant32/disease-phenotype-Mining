<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Saethre-Chotzen (SC) syndrome is characterized by increased osteogenesis and premature fusion of cranial sutures, resulting from mutations in TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular target genes for Twist in osteoblasts are however unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that TWIST haploinsufficiency in mutant osteoblasts reduces <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels for CBFA1/RUNX2, a specific osteoblast transcription factor, during both osteoblast cell growth and in vitro osteogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this is associated with altered expression of major osteoblast-specific genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed reduced-binding ability of Cbfa1 to its target OSE2 element in the osteocalcin promoter in mutant osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, TWIST inactivation does not hamper Cbfa1 binding on a similar upstream element present in the alpha1(I) collagen promoter in mutant osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This provides the first evidence that TWIST inactivation alters CBFA1/RUNX2 expression and Cbfa1 binding ability to the osteocalcin promoter, indicating that CBFA1/RUNX2 is a target gene for TWIST in human osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
