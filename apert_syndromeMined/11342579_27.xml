<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> is characterized by premature fusion of cranial sutures resulting from mutations in Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified Twist target genes using human mutant calvaria osteoblastic cells from a child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> with a Twist mutation that introduces a stop codon upstream of the bHLH domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed that Twist <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were reduced in mutant cells and that the Twist mutation increased cell growth in mutant osteoblasts compared with control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutation also caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0003155'>increased alkaline phosphatase</z:hpo> and type I collagen expression independently of cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During in vitro osteogenesis, Twist mutant cells showed increased ability to form alkaline phosphatase-positive bone-like nodular structures associated with increased type I collagen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutant cells also showed increased collagen synthesis and matrix production when cultured in aggregates, as well as an increased capacity to form a collagenous matrix in vivo when transplanted into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Twist mutant osteoblasts displayed a cell-autonomous reduction of osteocalcin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in basal conditions and during osteogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data show that genetic deletion of Twist causing reduced Twist dosage increases cell growth, collagen expression, and osteogenic capability, but inhibits osteocalcin gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This provides one mechanism that may contribute to the premature cranial ossification induced by deletion of the bHLH Twist domain in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
