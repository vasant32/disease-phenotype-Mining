<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by specific missense substitutions involving adjacent amino acids (Ser252Trp or Pro253Arg) in the linker between the second and third extracellular immunoglobulin domains of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a simple PCR assay for these mutations in genomic DNA, based on the creation of novel (SfiI) and (BstUI) restriction sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of DNA from 70 unrelated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> showed that 45 had the Ser252Trp mutation and 25 had the Pro253Arg mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic differences between these two groups of patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found for severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> was more severe with the Pro253Arg mutation, for both the hands and the feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> was significantly more common in the Ser252Trp patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No convincing differences were found in the prevalence of other malformations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, although the phenotype attributable to the two mutations is very similar, there are subtle differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The opposite trends for severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> in relation to the two mutations may relate to the varying patterns of temporal and tissue-specific expression of different fibroblast growth factors, the ligands for FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
