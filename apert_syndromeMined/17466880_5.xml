<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the intraoral features of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> in treatment at the Hospital of Rehabilitation and Craniofacial Anomalies of University of SÃ£o Paulo (HRAC-USP), a national reference center for treatment of craniofacial anomalies in Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective study, of 56,000 patients registered at HRAC-USP, 36 patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> and were either examined or had their medical files evaluated, aiming to characterize lip posture, mouth shape, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000327'>maxillary hypoplasia</z:hpo>, palatal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000164'>dental anomalies</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000689'>malocclusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most patients were characterized as mouth breathers for presenting with hypotonic lips and trapezoidal-shaped mouths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other frequent findings were the presence of highly <z:mp ids='MP_0003761'>arched palates</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000327'>hypoplastic maxilla</z:hpo>, with gingival lateral swellings that increased in size with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crowding of teeth</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000689'>malocclusion</z:hpo> were commonly observed, and cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> were frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to previous studies demonstrating a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000185'>cleft soft palate</z:hpo>, in this study only 1 of 23 patients presented a true cleft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The intraoral features of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> in the population studied match most of the findings in other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000185'>cleft soft palate</z:hpo> was unexpectedly low and morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> teeth were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> was frequently observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Variations in frequency of observations of some characteristics might be related to differences in sample size or population </plain></SENT>
