<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding the zinc finger transcription factor GLI3 (GLI-Kruppel family member 3) have been identified in patients with Grieg <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265306" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome</z:e> in which premature fusion of calvarial suture (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>) is an infrequent but important feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that Gli3 acts as a repressor in the developing murine calvaria and that Dlx5, Runx2 type II isoform (Runx2-II), and Bmp2 are expressed ectopically in the calvarial mesenchyme, which results in aberrant osteoblastic differentiation in Gli3-deficient mouse (Gli3(Xt-J/Xt-J)) and resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time, enhanced activation of phospho-Smad1/5/8 (pSmad1/5/8), which is a downstream mediator of canonical Bmp signaling, was observed in Gli3(Xt-J/Xt-J) embryonic calvaria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we generated Gli3;Runx2 compound mutant mice to study the effects of decreasing Runx2 dosage in a Gli3(Xt-J/Xt-J) background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gli3(Xt-J/Xt-J) Runx2(+/-) mice have neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> nor additional ossification centers in interfrontal suture and displayed a normalization of Dlx5, Runx2-II, and pSmad1/5/8 expression as well as sutural mesenchymal cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a novel role for Gli3 in regulating calvarial suture development by controlling canonical Bmp-Smad signaling, which integrates a Dlx5/Runx2-II cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that targeting Runx2 might provide an attractive way of preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> in patients </plain></SENT>
