<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, the preoperative and postoperative computed tomographic scans of 19 patients with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> who underwent Le Fort III advancement were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In four cases, preoperative polysomnography demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The airway was segmented using a semiautomatic region growing method with a fixed Hounsfield threshold value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Airway volumes of hypopharynx and oropharynx (compartment A) and nasopharynx and nasal cavity (compartment B) were analyzed separately, as was the total airway volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Advancement of the midface was recorded using lateral skull radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients together and for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>/Pfeiffer and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndromes</z:e> separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Airway volume increased significantly in compartment A (20 percent; p = 0.044) and compartment B (48 percent; p &lt; 0.001), as did total airway volume in (37 percent; p &lt; 0.001) in the total study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in volume changes were found comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>/Pfeiffer patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No distinct relation could be found between advancement of the midface and volume gain either in the total study group or in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>/Pfeiffer patient groups separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative polysomnography showed significant improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant improvement of the upper airway after Le Fort III advancement in syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> patients is demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No distinct relation could be observed between advancement and airway volume changes </plain></SENT>
