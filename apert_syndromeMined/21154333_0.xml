<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the disease-causing mutation in a Chinese patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> (AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the AS patient and his parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the exons 7 and 9 of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then PCR products were sequenced bi-directionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A heterozygous 934C to G transversion in exon 7 of the FGFR2 gene was detected in the patient, which resulted in the substitution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32732">tryptophan residue</z:chebi> for serine at position 252 of FGFR2 protein (S252W) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mutation has been reported in AS patients previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This Chinese AS results from the 934 C to G mutation in exon 7 of FGFR2 gene </plain></SENT>
