<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pfeiffer syndrome (PS) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorder</z:e> which affects the bones of the skull, hands and feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have mapped PS in a subset of families to chromosome 8cen by linkage analysis and demonstrated a common mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) gene in the linked families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report a second locus for PS on chromosome 10q25, and present evidence that mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR2) gene on 10q25 cause PS in an additional subset of familial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three different point mutations in FGFR2, which alter the same acceptor splice site of exon B, were observed in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and familial PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a T to C transition in exon B predicting a cysteine to arginine substitution was identified in three <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> PS individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this T to C change is identical to a mutation in FGFR2 previously reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, a phenotypically similar disorder but one lacking the hand and foot anomalies seen in PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results highlight the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> in PS and suggest that the molecular data will be an important complement to the clinical phenotype in defining <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
