<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Haploinsufficiency of the human TWIST1 gene, which causes the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> disorder <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS)</z:e>, is related to failure to repress transcription of CDKN1A (which encodes p21/WAF1/CIP1), promoting osteoblast differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the functional significance of natural TWIST1 variants present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> patients and in their healthy relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both deletion and duplication variants of the glycine-rich tract Gly5AlaGly5 inhibited E2A (E12/E47)-dependent transcription of CDKN1A to a similar degree as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein, indicating that the length of this glycine tract is not critical for efficient transcriptional repression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated a newly identified heterozygous TWIST1 variant (c.115C&gt;G, encoding p.Arg39Gly), located within a putative nuclear localization signal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLS</z:e>), that was present in a child with mild SCS and her clinically unaffected father and grandmother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein, this mutant required cotransfected E12 to localize to the nucleus, indicating that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLS</z:e>, including amino acid 39, is essential for nuclear localization; inhibition of E2A-dependent transcription of CDKN1A occurred normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis further dissects the structure-function relationships of TWIST and corroborates with phenotypic observations of disease expressivity </plain></SENT>
