<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Twist1 fulfills an essential function in neural crest cell formation, migration, and survival and is associated with the craniosynostic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its functions during mandibular development, when it may interact with other bHLH transcription factors like Hand2, are unknown because mice homozygous for the Twist1 null mutation die in early embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of Twist1 during mandibular development, we used the Hand2-Cre transgene to conditionally inactivate the gene in the neural crest cells populating the mandibular pharyngeal arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mutant mice exhibited a spectrum of craniofacial anomalies, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>mandibular hypoplasia</z:hpo>, altered middle ear development, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It appears that Twist1 is essential for the survival of the neural crest cells involved in the development of the mandibular ramal elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twist1 plays a role in molar development and cusp formation by participating in the reciprocal signaling needed for the formation of the enamel knot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This gene is also needed to control the ossification of the mandible, a redundant role shared with Hand2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Twist1, along with Hand2, is essential for the proximodistal patterning and development of the mandible and ossification </plain></SENT>
