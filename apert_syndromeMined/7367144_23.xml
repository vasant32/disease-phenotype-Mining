<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impression of unusual constraint in utero was further implied by finding associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005656'>positional foot deformities</z:hpo> in four of these latter eight children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that prolonged constraint of the fetal head may limit anteroposterior growth stretch at the coronal suture and thereby predispose toward early sutural fusion </plain></SENT>
