<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the treatment of patients having syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> with severe craniofacial abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient had Cruzon's syndrome, one had Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome, and four had Pfeiffers syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anterior cranial deformity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was treated using fronto-orbital advancement (FOA) by gradual distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, the frontal and supraorbital bones were removed and remodeled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, the frontal bones were fixed loosely to the supraorbital bones with absorbable threads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, the supraorbital and temporal bones were connected using distraction devices on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The temporal bones were thereafter reinforced with <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distraction was started one week postoperation, and the mean amount of elongation was 28.9 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Distraction devices were removed one to five months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One case required FOA by the traditional method ten months after the initial operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was observed in three cases, but there were no majors complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Posterior cranial remodelings were performed in five cases, with one requiring a second operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We chose the appropriate procedure according to the degree of cranial deformity and operative findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We performed decompression of the foramen magnum in five cases and laminectomy of the atlas in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ventriculoperitoneal shunt for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and tracheotomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cranial remodeling for treating severe craniofacial abnormality requires careful inspection of abnormalities, proper timing, close attention to the procedure and adequate perioperative care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Multidisciplinary therapy is essential for treating severe syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> due to systematic osseocartilaginous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
