<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the symmetric two-end model, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> promotes dimerization of two FGF-FGFR complexes by stabilizing bivalent interactions of the ligand and receptor through primary and secondary sites and by stabilizing direct receptor-receptor contacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the asymmetric model, there are no protein-protein contacts between the two FGF-FGFR complexes, which are bridged solely by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify the correct mode of FGFR dimerization, we abolished interactions at the secondary ligand-receptor interaction site, which are observed only in the symmetric two-end model, using site-directed mutagenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cellular studies and real-time binding assays, as well as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight analysis, demonstrate that loss of secondary ligand-receptor interactions results in diminished FGFR activation due to decreased dimerization without affecting FGF-FGFR binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, structural and biochemical analysis of an activating FGFR2 mutation resulting in Pfeiffer syndrome confirms the physiological significance of receptor-receptor contacts in the symmetric two-end model and provides a novel mechanism for FGFR gain of function in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the data validate the symmetric two-end model of FGFR dimerization and argue against the asymmetric model of FGFR dimerization </plain></SENT>
