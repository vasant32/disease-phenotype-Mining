<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>vertebral fusion</z:hpo> either in progress or completed was observed in 37 (63%) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fusion was limited to a single vertebral level in 18 cases and multiple levels, involving either contiguous or skipped levels in the remaining 19+ C3-4 and C5-6 were the levels most commonly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This distribution of fusions is different from other instances of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> including those associated with other varieties of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between age at the time of radiograph and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusions</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon 2-sample test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of sequential radiographs in 17 patients revealed evidence of progressive fusion in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small size of the vertebral body and reduced intervertebral disc space were indicators of subsequent bony fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fusions seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> thus appear to be progressive, occurring at the site of subtle congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003468'>vertebral anomalies</z:hpo> and may not be apparent as a congenital feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The implications for the aetiology of so-called "congenital' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusions</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and other situations are discussed </plain></SENT>
