<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Le Fort III osteotomy was applied through coronal route on patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The procedures included disconnecting the skeletal midface from base of cranium, setting up a RED II distraction device, and directing the device bars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distraction was started 5 days after the surgery, with a rate of 1 mm forward per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When midface approaching the right position, i.e. a slightly over correction of occlusion was reached, stopped distraction and kept the device for 2 - 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight cases completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average blood lose was 300 ml and the average operation time was 3.5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The midface had been moved averagely 9 mm forwardly and 1.5 mm downwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The features had been improved obviously and the occlusion reached nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No serious complications occurred except for 1 case of seroma and 1 case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> around pin on scalp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No recurrence was found in the 5 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Midface distraction osteogenesis is propitious to teenage or severe cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
