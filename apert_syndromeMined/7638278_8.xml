<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their ICV also was compared with those of an age- and gender-matched cohort and reviewed their rate of cranial expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 21 children who presented sequentially with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> (n = 13) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> (n = 8) syndrome between 1987 and 1991 and who subsequently underwent a standard first-stage cranio-orbital reconstruction by the senior author (J.C.P.) in conjunction with a pediatric neurosurgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary method of osteotomy and bone graft fixation varied (i.e., wires, microplates, miniplates, and screws) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The series included 16 females and 5 males with an average age at the time of operation of 13 months (range, 6 to 46 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative clinical follow-up ranged from 12 to 60 months at the time of the study's completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the IVCs of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> patients preoperatively and postoperative with age and gender control volumes showed that six of eight had volumes at least 2 SD above the mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the trend continued with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight patients followed longitudinally; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> maintained volumes in excess of 2 standard deviations above the mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> children evaluated, 12 of 13 had ICV values greater than the mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When comparing the patients' postoperative volumes to the normative data, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 maintained values at or greater than the mean at the time of their postoperative determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 13 achieved ICVs at or greater than 2 SD above the mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When reviewing each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> patient's cranial capacity over time, 5 of the 13 approximated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth curve whereas 6 of the 13 exceeded it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> patients are macrocephalic before and after standard cranio-orbital procedures carried out in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For the majority of children born with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, the cranial capacity will exceed the mean early in life and expand at a rapid rate after cranio-orbital decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The biologic explanation for these findings remain unclear </plain></SENT>
