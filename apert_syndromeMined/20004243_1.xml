<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known, however, whether there is a relationship between defective Fgf signalling, resulting in a premature cranial suture fusion, and Tgfbeta signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used mouse calvaria osteoblasts carrying a mutation (hFGFR2-C278F) associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and Pfeiffer syndromes to investigate effects of this mutation on cell growth and possible mechanisms underlying it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutated osteoblasts displayed reduced S-phase, <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> and increased differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As Tgfbeta signalling appeared to be required in an autocrine/paracrine manner for osteoblast proliferation, we tested the hypothesis that reduced growth might be due, at least in part, to an altered balance between FGF and Tgfbeta signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tgfbeta expression was indeed decreased in mutated osteoblasts, as compared to osteoblasts carrying the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> hFGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Tgfbeta, however, neither increased proliferation in mutated osteoblasts, unlike in controls, nor rescued proliferation in control osteoblasts treated with an Erk1/2 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly, Erk2, that is important for proliferation, was reduced relatively to Erk1 in mutated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether this study suggests that the hFGFR2-C278F mutation affects the osteoblast ability to respond to Tgfbeta stimulation via the Erk pathway and that the overall effect of the mutation is a loss of function </plain></SENT>
