<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to report the patterns of craniofacial anomalies in Saudi Arabia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Hospital-based, descriptive study conducted during 2002 to 2009 in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>Cleft Lip</z:mp>/Palate and Craniofacial Anomalies Registry at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data was collected on craniofacial patients in the registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 447 craniofacial patients (male, 242; female, 205), 109 (24.4%) had only cranial anomalies, 261 (58.4%) had only facial anomalies and 77 (17.2%) had both of these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>Craniosynostosis</z:hpo> was seen in 33.3% of the total patients (81 males and 68 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 65 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromic patients, 25 (38.5%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and 18 (27.7%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among facial anomalies, 47 (19.4%) had dysmorphic features, followed by 35 (14.5%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among facial syndromes, 72 (59.0%) were observed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000201'>Pierre-Robin sequence</z:hpo>, 17 (13.9%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265240" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="OAVS">Goldenhar syndrome</z:e> and another 17 (13.9%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>Cleft palate</z:hpo> was more common in 171 (56.8%) patients as an associated deformity, followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> in 99 (32.9%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> in 23 (7.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 224 patients having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other congenital anomalies</z:e>, the cardiovascular system was most commonly affected, with 46 (20.5%) children diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A family history of anomalies was observed more in children born to parents of a consanguineous marriage than in those whose parents were unrelated (P=.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Additional efforts should be made towards creating awareness among the general population about these deformities in relation to consanguinity </plain></SENT>
