<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dominant mutations in three fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (FGFRs1-3) cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, Jackson-Weiss, Pfeiffer, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 50 Brazilian patients with these four syndromes (27 Apert, 17 Crouzon, 5 Pfeiffer, and 1 Jackson-Weiss patients) were screened for mutations in the FGFR1-3 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Except for one, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> patients had either S252W (n = 16) or P253R (n = 10) mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> case is atypical with a mutation altering the splice site of FGFR2 exon IIIc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Pfeiffer patients had mutations in one of the FGFR genes: three in FGFR2, one in FGFR1, and one in FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 8 of the 17 Crouzon patients studied had a mutation in either FGFR2 (n = 7) or FGFR3 locus (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the FGFR2 locus account for most (93%) of our syndromic craniosynostotic cases, whereas 5% had mutations in the FGFR3 locus and only 2% had mutations in the FGFR1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for one, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other mutations were reported previously in craniosynostotic patients from other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the mutation C278F, previously described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and Pfeiffer cases, was here identified in a familial case with Jackson-Weiss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, unexpectedly, a common mutation altering the splice site of the FGFR2 exon IIIc was found in one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> and two Pfeiffer patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we identified a new mutation (A337P) in the FGFR2 exon IIIc associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
