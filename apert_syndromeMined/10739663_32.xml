<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> Ser252Trp fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR-2) mutation causes premature osteoblast differentiation and increased subperiosteal calvaria bone matrix formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain further insight into the cellular mechanisms involved in these effects, we examined the effects of the mutation on the expression of FGFRs in relation to cell proliferation and differentiation markers in vivo and in vitro, and we analyzed the underlying signaling pathways in mutant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> calvaria suture showed that the Ser252Trp FGFR-2 mutation increased type 1 collagen, osteocalcin, and osteopontin expression in preosteoblasts compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, whereas cell growth was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The premature osteoblast differentiation induced by the mutation was associated with lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FGFR-2 immunolabeling, whereas FGFR-1 and FGFR-3 levels were not decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical analysis in osteoblasts isolated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> coronal suture showed that the Ser252Trp mutation induced constitutive downregulation of FGFR-2 in mutant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of FGFRs in immortalized mutant osteoblastic cells confirmed that the mutation induced FGFR-2 downregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FGFR-2 mRNA levels were not altered in mutant cells, indicating that FGFR-2 downregulation resulted from receptor internalization rather than from changes in receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The signaling pathway involved in FGFR-2 downregulation was studied using specific inhibitors of FGF signaling molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The selective PKC inhibitor calphostin C markedly reduced FGFR-2 protein levels in mutant cells, in contrast to the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB 203580 or the Erk 1,2 MAP kinase inhibitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059, showing that PKC is involved in FGFR-2 regulation, but not in FGFR-2 downregulation in mutant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the premature osteoblast differentiation induced by the FGFR-2 Ser252Trp mutation is associated with a PKC-independent downregulation of FGFR-2 in human calvaria cells </plain></SENT>
