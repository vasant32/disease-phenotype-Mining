<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies in the literature have addressed the oral health of these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the periodontal status of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, Pfeiffer and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndromes</z:e> before toothbrushing and compare the efficiency of plaque removal before and after mechanical toothbrushing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probing depth, plaque index (according to Löe and O'Leary), clinical attachment level, gingival index (according to Silness and Löe) and amount of keratinized mucosa were evaluated before toothbrushing, and the O'Leary plaque index was assessed before and immediately after toothbrushing, on the same day, in 27 individuals aged 11 to 36 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was statistically significant difference in the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level among regions (p=0.00; p=0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gingival index did not reveal statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to the plaque index, the left region exhibited higher plaque index values than the right and anterior regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant results were found in the analysis of keratinized mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the O'Leary plaque index before and after toothbrushing revealed statistically significant difference for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> syndromes except for the Pfeiffer syndrome (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there was no difference in the periodontal status among individuals with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The posterior region was more affected than the anterior region as to the presence of plaque, loss of insertion and probing depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Individuals with Pfeiffer syndrome exhibited greater toothbrushing efficiency than individuals with the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
