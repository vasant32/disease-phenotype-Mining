<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: External maxillary distractions present additional <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> concerns to the existing complexity of the patient with craniofacial disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distraction hardware is rigidly fixed to the cranium and projects in the frontofacial midline, thus limiting oronasal airway access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A review of 16 patients (10 male, 6 female) having external maxillary distraction was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with patent tracheostomies were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the same type of external distraction device was used (R.E.D., K.L.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Martin, Jacksonville, FL, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative records were reviewed for medical history; operative diagnosis, presence of airway disease, tracheostomy, laryngoscopy grade, use of fiberoptic bronchoscope, procedure, operative time, use of intraoperative steroid, day of postoperative extubation, and need for reintubation were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study group was subdivided into two diagnostic categories: those with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> (n = 9) and those with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate (CLP) (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the craniosynostotic group had grade 1 laryngoscopy views, with the exception of a single patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> who had a grade 3 view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was the only patient who required fiberoptic intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> required reintubation (48 hours after surgery); successful extubation was done 96 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had grade 1 laryngoscopic views, except one with a grade 3 view; no patient required fiberoptic intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six of the seven patients were extubated immediately after surgery, with one patient extubated the next day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patient experienced failure of extubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: External maxillary distraction minimally affects <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management provided certain safeguards are observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The vertical bar can be left attached to the cranial portion of the distractor, or it can be removed for extubation or reintubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Removal of the vertical bar allows unobstructed direct laryngoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This emphasizes the importance for the emergent availability of the appropriate screwdrivers and wire cutters to remove the vertical bar and trained personnel to perform the removal </plain></SENT>
