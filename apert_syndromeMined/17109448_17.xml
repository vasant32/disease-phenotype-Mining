<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>-affected children and their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the influence of treatment, and outcome have so far not been studied in a nonselected, population-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> patients less than 16 years old reported to the German <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Childhood Cancer</z:e> Registry and to the Kiel Paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Registry from 1980 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-nine <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> in children (24 boys, 25 girls) with a median age of 10.6 years were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In about every third child possibly <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>-related underlying disorders (tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo> with chemotherapy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo>) or related diseases in their family were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathologic subtypes were papillary in 16 (33%), translocation type in 11 (22%), unclassified in 8 (16%), and rarely clear-cell (n = 3) or others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four (69%) patients had localized <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>, 8 (16%) patients regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e>, and 4 (8%) patients distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival and overall survival rates at 5 years were 96% for localized <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>, 69% and 75% for regional lymph node-positive, 25% and 33% for distant metastatic <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of 4 patients with distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> received immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy and surgery, both are alive, 1 of them disease-free for 6.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCCs</z:chebi> are predominantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> frequently suffer underlying disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival rates in localized and regional lymph node-positive cases are favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of the rarity of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> in childhood, an international study is necessary </plain></SENT>
