<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim was to assess the stability of monobloc distraction osteogenesis using three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) scan volume-rendered images with the "biporion-dorsum sellae" plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was a prospective study of patients undergoing monobloc internal distraction osteogenesis at the International Craniofacial Institute, Dallas, TX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made of the perpendicular distance of 8 skeletal facial points to the static "biporion-dorsum sellae" plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The statistical analyses were performed with the paired-samples t test in SPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three male patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 2 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> (A, B) and 1 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275078,C1305108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Carpenter syndrome</z:e> (C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 73 (range 30-112) months, and the mean follow up was 14 (range 8-12) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The consolidation period was 17, 23, and 28 weeks in each patient, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patient A, the paired-samples t test of matched points was P = 0.022 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the three-dimensional lateral profile revealed an obvious relapse, and predistractor removal CT scans (at 17 weeks) also showed deficient bone growth across the distraction gaps at the anterior cranial fossae and the temporal bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients B and C showed a stable outcome after distraction and after removal of distraction devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On analysis of the predistractor removal three-dimensional CT scans (23 and 28 weeks, respectively), there was more bone growth across the distraction gaps at the anterior cranial fossa and temporal bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The "biporion-dorsum sellae" plane was used to assess the results of monobloc distraction osteogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Relapse was associated with inadequate bone growth across the anterior cranial fossa and temporal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The findings seem to point the way for an increased consolidation period and more detailed examination of the CT scans before removal of internal distraction devices </plain></SENT>
