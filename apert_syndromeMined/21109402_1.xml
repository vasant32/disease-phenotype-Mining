<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>20 patients were treated with midface distraction (12 Crouzon, 4 Apert, 4 others); 12 with internal distraction (MID device), 8 with external distraction (Red or Blue device) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two groups were compared regarding operation time, peroperative blood loss and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups were comparable regarding patient age, sex, weight and diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the MID-group, 7 of 12 patients (58%) underwent Le Fort III, 5 underwent 12 monobloc (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Blue device group, three of eight patients underwent Le Fort II (38%), three of eight underwent Le Fort III (38%), and two of eight underwent monobloc (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operation time was shorter in the Blue device (mean 298 min) than in the MID group (mean 354 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peroperative blood loss and complication rates were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The internal distraction device is the 'gold standard' for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011800'>midface retrusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of an external distraction device in midface distraction osteogenesis is associated with a shorter operation time; peroperative blood loss and complications were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An external device affords better 3-dimensional control during the distraction process, so external distraction is preferable in patients who will tolerate this treatment </plain></SENT>
