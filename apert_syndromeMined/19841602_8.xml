<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twelve patients aged 2 to 67 years identified with posterior semicircular canal dehiscence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Patients identified by suspicious clinical history and examination, confirmed by high-resolution computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Audiological evaluation included air and bone audiometry, tympanometry, acoustic reflexes, and vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hearing loss was mixed in 9 patients, conductive in 2 patients, and sensorineural in 1 patient, with downward-sloping configuration being the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Imaging revealed that 7 of 12 patients had dehiscence into a high-riding jugular bulb and 1 patient had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011387'>enlarged vestibular aqueduct</z:hpo> with a Mondini malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and another patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0008551'>microtia</z:hpo>/atresia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vestibular symptoms were more common in the adult patients than in the pediatric patients, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disequilibrium the most common complaint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing confirmed dehiscence with the characteristic response of reduced threshold and higher amplitude compared with healthy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first reported series of adult and pediatric patients with symptomatic posterior semicircular canal dehiscence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Posterior semicircular canal dehiscence represents a third-window lesion manifesting as hearing loss with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001751'>vestibular dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography findings of a dehiscent posterior canal can be verified with increased vestibular evoked myogenic potential responses as in other third-window lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients found to have a high-riding jugular bulb and hearing loss should have specific inspection of the posterior canal to ensure it is not dehiscent </plain></SENT>
