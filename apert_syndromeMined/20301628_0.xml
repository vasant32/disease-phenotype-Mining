<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Muenke syndrome and FGFR2-related isolated coronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> are characterized only by uni- or bicoronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>; the remainder are characterized by bicoronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo>, distinctive facial features, and variable hand and foot findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Muenke syndrome is based on identification of the p.Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3; the diagnosis of FGFR2-related isolated coronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> is based on identification of a FGFR2 disease-causing mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of the other six FGFR-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes is based on clinical findings; molecular genetic testing of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 may be helpful in establishing the specific diagnosis in questionable cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Management by a multidisciplinary craniofacial clinic affiliated with a major pediatric medical center when possible; syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> usually requires a series of staged surgical procedures (craniotomy and fronto-orbital advancement) tailored to individual needs; for syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, the first surgery is often as early as age three months, for nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> the first surgery is often between ages six months and one year; congenital spine anomalies need immediate attention; surgical correction of limb defects depends on the nature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal anomalies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevention of secondary complications: Early treatment of craniofacial anomalies may reduce the risk for secondary complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>; ophthalmologic lubrication can prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339295" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">exposure keratopathy</z:e> in those with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surveillance: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in those at increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Testing of relatives at risk: Evaluation of at-risk relatives clinically and radiographically or with molecular genetic testing if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known, so that mildly affected relatives can benefit from early intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GENETIC COUNSELING: The FGFR-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes are inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Affected individuals have a 50% chance of passing the disease-causing mutation to each child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation has been identified in the family; however, its use is limited by poor predictive value </plain></SENT>
