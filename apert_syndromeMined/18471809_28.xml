<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we found that Twist1 forms functional homodimers and heterodimers that have opposing activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data supported a model that within the calvaria sutures Twist1 homodimers (T/T) reside in the osteogenic fronts while Twist1/E protein heterodimers (T/E) are in the mid-sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twist1 haploinsufficiency alters the balance between these dimers, favoring an increase in homodimer formation throughout the sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data we present here further supports this model and extends it to integrate the Twist1 dimers with the pathways that are known to regulate cranial suture patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This data provides the first evidence of a functional link between Twist1 and the FGF pathway, and indicates that differential regulation of FGF signaling by T/T and T/E dimers plays a central role in governing cranial suture patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that inhibition of FGF signaling prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> in Twist1(+/-) mice, demonstrating that inhibition of a signaling pathway that is not part of the initiating mutation can prevent suture fusion in a relevant genetic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
