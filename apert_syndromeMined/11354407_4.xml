<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>Brachycephaly</z:hpo> is a characteristic feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditional techniques of cranioplasty often fail to produce an acceptable morphological outcome in patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1996 a new surgical procedure called "dynamic cranioplasty for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo>" (DCB) was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to analyze perioperative data and morphological long-term results in patients with the cranial vault deformity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> who were treated with DCB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients have undergone surgery performed using this technique since its introduction in 1991 (mean duration of follow-up review 60.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011318'>bicoronal synostosis</z:hpo> and one had a combined bicoronal-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011319'>bilambdoid synostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative data and long-term evolution of skull shape visualized on serial cephalometric radiographs were analyzed and compared with normative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in mean skull proportions were evaluated using a two-tailed paired-samples t-test, with differences being considered significant for probability values less than 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean operative blood transfusion was 136% of estimated red cell mass (ERCM) and the mean postoperative transfusion was 48% of ERCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean operative time was 218 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The duration of stay in the intensive care unit averaged 1.7 days and the mean hospital stay was 11.8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no incidences of mortality and few complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An improvement in skull shape was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, with a change in the mean cephalic index from a preoperative value of 90 to a postoperative value of 78 (p = 0.000254) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic cranioplasty for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> is a safe procedure, yielding high-quality morphological results in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
