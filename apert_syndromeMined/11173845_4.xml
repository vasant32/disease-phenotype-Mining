<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 36 unrelated German patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and Pfeiffer type were analyzed for FGFR mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in FGFR2 were identified in 25 Crouzon and 5 Pfeiffer syndrome patients, whereas no sequence alterations were found in the remaining patients, even after screening of the relevant parts of FGFR1, FGFR3, and TWIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in FGFR2 clustered at two critical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi>, 278 and 342, which were involved in 18 of 30 cases (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two mutational hot spots, therefore, are prime targets for an efficient mutation-screening strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of mutations overlapped the two syndromes and thus reflected the phenotypic similarities observed in both patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 21 families, the origin of the mutation could be traced by analyzing parents and relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven mutations arose de novo, indicating a high mutation rate for FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 10 familial cases, the clinical presentation varied considerably within the pedigree, but both syndromes "bred true," i.e., a Pfeiffer syndrome phenotype was never observed in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> family and vice versa </plain></SENT>
