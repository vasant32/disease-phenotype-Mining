<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper reports a cephalometric analysis of the craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in adolescents and adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sample comprised 26 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> (15 males and 11 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 153 adults (102 males and 51 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both lateral and frontal cephalograms were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were presented as mean plots of the craniofacial region together with data on some of the most significant findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marked differences were found in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> craniofacial regions except the mandible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The calvaria was increased in height and width but length was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cranial base showed marked protrusion of the greater wing of the sphenoid, which contributed to severe reduction of orbital volume and protrusion of the eyeglobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Orbital volume was further reduced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000327'>maxillary hypoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three planes of space together with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000278'>retrognathia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maxillary height was extremely short and so was the nose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The width of the nasal cavity, height and depth of the bony nasopharynx, and the nasopharyngeal airway were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markedly reduced in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mandible was of fairly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> size and shape but was posteriorly inclined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Head posture was extended in relation to the cervical column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Total facial height was increased, whereas upper facial height was markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Incisor occlusion showed mandibular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011095'>overjet</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010807'>open bite</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> patients were then compared to a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Marked and significant differences were found between the two syndromes in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> craniofacial regions, and craniofacial dysmorphology was generally more severe in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
