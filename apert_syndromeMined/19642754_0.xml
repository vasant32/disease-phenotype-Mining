<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Design: The study comprised a review of the medical, nutrition, and feeding records of 13 consecutive infants still feeding by the bottle who had been referred to the Craniofacial Unit and analyses of swallow function from videofluoroscopic swallow investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Main Outcome Measures: Outcome measures included qualitative analyses of bottle-feeding and nutritional status and quantitative functional severity ratings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> based on videofluoroscopic swallow investigations using the O'Neil et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(1999) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> Outcome Severity Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: The main qualitative descriptors of oral feeding in this cohort included uncoordinated suck-swallow-breathe patterns, inability to maintain sucking bursts, and changes in respiratory patterns as the feed progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Videofluoroscopic evaluations (N = 7) showed silent laryngeal penetration or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> in more than half of the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>Failure to thrive</z:hpo> was a frequent occurrence seen in seven infants, and 9 of the 10 required dietetic intervention and enteral supplements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(Nutritional records were not located for three infants.) Conclusions: In view of the small sample size and retrospective nature of the study, the results need to be interpreted with caution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the study adds to current limited knowledge on feeding and nutrition in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further prospective multidisciplinary and objective research is clearly warranted </plain></SENT>
