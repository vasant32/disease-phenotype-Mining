<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess whether, in the presence of the <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi>, bone dust harvested with a power burr promotes persistent ossification that is comparable with adjacent bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mesh was localized by standard skull plain x-ray films, and orthogonal CT scans were obtained at between 9 and 18 months post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An ultrahigh-resolution algorithm was used to detect neoossification on either side of the Micro Mesh (1-mm collimation, 330-mA and 120 KV(p) at the center of 400 HU, and window width of 2000 Hu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mesh induced minimal streak artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Virtually no new bone formation was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It appears that bone dust was completely reabsorbed in this patient group even in the presence of semi-rigid fixation </plain></SENT>
