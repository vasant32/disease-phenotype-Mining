<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Making use of transcranial Doppler sonographic (TCD) technology to monitor the preoperative and postoperative changes in cerebral hemodynamics of sick children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e> and to evaluate the effects brought about by decompression surgery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e> by means of various changes in the parameters of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Choosing bilateral middle cerebral arteries as target vessels by means of TCD and recording preoperative and postoperative cerebral blood flow velocities (peak systolic [Vs] and diastolic velocities [Vd]), pulsatility index (PI), blood pressure, and pulse rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 11 cases of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e>, postoperative Vs and Vd of 4 children aged 0 to 3 years old increased by 20.25 (14.75) and 15.75 (12.98) cm/s, respectively (P &lt; 0.05); PI reduced by 0.09 (0.09) (P &gt; 0.05); finger press marks could be found in 4 skull x-ray films, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> was found in one of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative Vs and Vd of 5 children aged 4 to 7 years old increased by 16.20 (15.39) and 15.00 (11.71) cm/s, respectively (P &lt; 0.05); PI reduced by 0.14 (0.11) (P &lt; 0.05); one of them experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 children aged 11 years old, postoperative Vs, Vd, and PI increased by 2.50 (5.00) and 0.500 (3.79) cm/s and 0.09 (0.09), respectively (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An abnormality could be found in electroencephalograms of a child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and 2 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Operation can improve obviously younger sick children's cerebral blood flow velocity and PI; for older children, the improvement of diastolic cerebral blood flow velocity was more obvious than that of systolic cerebral blood flow velocity, and PI reduced distinctly, which showed that decompression surgery had a perfect effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TCD parameters of an 11-year-old sick child who has a smaller head circumference but without intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> could not be improved obviously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler sonography can be regarded as a simple and convenient tool for the noninvasive evaluation on the effect of decompression surgery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
