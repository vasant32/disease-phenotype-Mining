<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As the second of a two-part series, 76 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011325'>pansynostosis</z:hpo> and craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> syndromes were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011325'>pansynostosis</z:hpo> (7), craniofrontonasal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (8), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> (24), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> (15), and Pfeiffer (15) syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent primary fronto-orbital advancement-calvarial vault remodeling procedures at less than 18 months of age (mean 6.1 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (36.8 percent) required a secondary cranial vault operation (mean age 28.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a major tertiary procedure was necessary in 5 patients to deal with persistent unacceptable craniofacial form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To address the associated finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo>, 64.8 percent (n = 35) of patients underwent Le Fort III midface advancement or had that procedure recommended for them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remainder were awaiting appropriate age for this reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The more extensive pathologic involvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011325'>pansynostosis</z:hpo> and craniofacial syndrome group is illustrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As compared with the isolated craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> group previously reported, the incidence of major secondary procedures (36.8 versus 13.5 percent), perioperative complications (11.3 versus 5.0 percent), follow-up complications (44.7 versus 7.7 percent), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (42.1 versus 3.9 percent), shunt placement (22.4 versus 1.0 percent), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (11.8 versus 2.9 percent) was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complex problems including those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e>, and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000262'>turricephaly</z:hpo> or cranial vault maldevelopment are repeatedly encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, that early fronto-orbital advancement-cranial vault remodeling failed to promote midface development and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of this region is almost a consistent finding in the craniofacial syndromic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average length of postoperative follow-up was 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to the classification of Whitaker et al., which assesses surgical results, 73.7 percent of patients were considered to have at least satisfactory craniofacial form (category I-II) at latest evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An algorithmic approach to the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> is presented utilizing early surgical intervention as the key element </plain></SENT>
