<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study took place at the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies of University of SÃ£o Paulo (HRAC-USP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sample was 19 patients with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> (10 Apert, 5 Crouzon, 2 Pfeiffer and 2 Saethre-Chotzen), aged 5 to 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An assessment of plaque, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> and gingival indices, and evaluation of the efficacy of toothbrushing was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The measurements included PHP index, dmft and DMFT indices, gingival index, comparison of PHP before and after non-supervised toothbrushing and between individuals with and without severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients displayed high plaque index and poor efficacy of toothbrushing, regardless of the presence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo>; despite the plaque accumulation, the gingival index was not proportionally high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was predominance of the D component for the DMFT index, which combined with the need for restorative treatment in 42.1% of the patients indicates poor access to dental care by these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results show the need for a dental follow-up programme for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Carers should be informed of the importance in aiding these patients during accomplishment of oral hygiene at home </plain></SENT>
