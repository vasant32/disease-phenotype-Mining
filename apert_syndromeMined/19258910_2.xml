<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technical and physiological principles of osteogenesis distraction are well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study documents the pattern of calcification at the osteotomy sites after distraction by analysis of serial three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CT scans of 25 patients (11 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, 6 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, and 8 with Pfeiffer syndrome) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven individual areas along the osteotomy lines were assessed for evidence of bone formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scores were assigned within 4 categories ranging from no bone, calcification without bridge formation, a bony bridge, to complete bony infill (&gt;95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The scans were reviewed on 2 separate occasions by 2 independent assessors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was high concordance both for intraobserver and interobserver scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rigid external distraction frame removal was undertaken after a 6-week consolidation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CT scan timings were calculated from this date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 25 patients studied, 16 patients had CT scans available at 3 to 6 months, 12 at 9 to 12 months, and 7 at or more than 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The scans were available in standard coronal slices with three-dimensional reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bone formation is most consistently seen in the pterygoid region with calcification consistently occurring earlier and more completely in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bone formation was often delayed in the orbital region and severely delayed or absent in the frontal region and zygomatic arches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the order or quality of bony union for the 3 underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">craniofacial dysostoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study confirms the clinical impression that bone formation after distraction is greatest in the pterygoid regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications of these findings are discussed </plain></SENT>
