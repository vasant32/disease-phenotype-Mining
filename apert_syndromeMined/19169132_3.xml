<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Pediatric tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twenty pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> were found; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (38/40 ears) had inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0000598'>ear anomalies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Computerized tomography of the head/temporal bone, pure-tone (including air and bone conduction) audiometry, and tympanometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Imaging demonstrating inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0000598'>ear anomalies</z:hpo>, including malformations of the cochlea, dilated vestibule, and/or semicircular canal; audiologic findings of air-bone gap(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hearing loss was found in 90% of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, and 80% of them had CHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Air-bone gaps were found at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> frequencies, with larger gaps at low frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent (20/40) of the ears had better than 0 dB hearing level bone conduction thresholds at 250 and/or 500 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> middle ear pressure and mobility were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ears with intact eardrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0000598'>ear anomalies</z:hpo> were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and 90% of them had bilateral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most frequently observed inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0000598'>ear anomalies</z:hpo> were dilated vestibule, malformed lateral semicircular canal, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000031'>cochlear dysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> may present with significant CHL that cannot be explained by minor middle ear pathologies alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This conductive loss may be, at least partially, attributed to the inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0000598'>ear anomalies</z:hpo>; however, these structural anomalies are usually not recognized in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Failure to close air-bone gap after surgical intervention may raise the suspicion of inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0000598'>ear anomalies</z:hpo>, and computed tomographic scan of the temporal bone can provide definitive proof </plain></SENT>
