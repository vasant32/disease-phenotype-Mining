<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Severe cases usually require emergency care at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, early diagnosis is often precluded by the rarity and consequent low awareness of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to clarify phenotypic expressions useful for the diagnosis of PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of PS type 2 or 3 according to Cohen's classification that were reported between 1980 and 2011 in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and genetic information were extracted from the patients' medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 23 patients with PS type 2 or 3 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 23 patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011304'>broad thumbs</z:hpo>, and wide great toes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FGFR2 mutations were confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 patients in whom genetic analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to classic symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003070'>elbow ankylosis</z:hpo> and sacrococcygeal defects were present in 70% and 30% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During an average follow-up of 22 months, 22% of patients died before 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003070'>Elbow ankylosis</z:hpo> and sacrococcygeal defects were the phenotypic features recognizable at a glance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These defects strongly suggest the presence of PS in newborns with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
