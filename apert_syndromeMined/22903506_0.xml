<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to determine the potential relationship between suture fusion and cranial base development in a model of syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and to assess the effects of the syndrome on resynostosis following suturectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To do this, posterior frontal and coronal suture fusion, postnatal development of sphenooccipital synchondrosis, and resynostosis in Twist1(+/+) (WT) and Twist1(+/-) litter-matched mice (a model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>) were quantified by evaluating Î¼CT images with advanced image-processing algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The coronal suture in Twist(+/-) mice developed, fused, and mineralized at a faster rate than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> littermates at postnatal days 6-30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, premature fusion of the coronal suture in Twist1(+/-) mice preceded alterations in cranial base development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of synchondrosis showed faster mineralization in Twist(+/-) mice at postnatal days 25-30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a rapid resynostosis model, there was an inability to fuse both the midline posterior frontal suture and craniotomy defects in 21-day-old Twist(+/-) mice, despite having accelerated mineralization in the posterior frontal suture and defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study showed that dissimilarities between Twist1(+/+) and Twist1(+/-) mice are not limited to a fused coronal suture but include differences in fusion of other sutures, the regenerative capacity of the cranial vault, and the development of the cranial base </plain></SENT>
