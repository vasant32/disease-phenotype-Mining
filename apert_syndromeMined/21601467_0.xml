<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most craniofacial abnormalities are non-syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e> due to premature fusion of one or more craniofacial sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functional impairment is caused either by a pathological growth pattern or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The indications for surgery are to increase intracranial volume and to correct aesthetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 172 patients who had been operated on for premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, including fronto-orbital advancement, from 1992 to 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, clinical follow-up findings, and regular photo documentation were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 6 years the overall outcome for those operated on within the first 6 months of life was satisfactory in 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3% were reoperated at between 4 and 6 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cephalometric indices normalized postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent SPECT studies which showed preoperative perfusion asymmetry corresponding to the fused sutures that were normalized following surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No severe perioperative complications were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Cephalometric parameters represent an excellent method to compare the postoperative outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Standard skull base procedures need to be adapted carefully to the individual form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> to avoid an unfavourable result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">Photon</z:chebi> Emissin Computed Tomography (SPECT) studies give evidence that correction of single cranial suture <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> allows for normalization of cerebral blood flow and should be performed within first 6-8 months of life </plain></SENT>
