<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that Twist haploinsufficiency caused by a Y103X nonsense mutation in SCS alters both proliferation and osteoblast gene expression in human calvarial osteoblasts, indicating that Twist is an important regulator of osteoblast differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that Twist haploinsufficiency alters osteoblast <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in SCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labelling (TUNEL) demonstrated increased osteoblast and osteocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in coronal sutures from two SCS patients with nonsense mutations (Y103X and Q109X) that result in the synthesis of bHLH-truncated proteins, and one patient with a missense mutation in the basic domain (R118C) that abolishes Twist DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the mechanisms involved, we studied osteoblast <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in mutant (M-Tw) calvarial cells bearing the Y103X mutation resulting in decreased Twist <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>M-Tw cells cultured in low serum conditions showed enhanced DNA fragmentation compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (Nl) age-matched calvarial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis showed increased activity of initiator caspases-2 and -8 and downstream effector caspases-3, -6 and -7 in mutant osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Caspase-2 was upstream of caspase-8 and effector caspases-3, -6 and -7 because their activities were suppressed by a specific caspase-2 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>M-Tw osteoblasts also showed increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release from the mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the activity of the downstream effector caspase-9 was not increased due to overexpression of the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> protein Hsp70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Detection of differentially expressed genes using cDNA expression array revealed increased Bax and TNFalpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in M-Tw compared to Nl cells, a finding confirmed by RT-PCR and western blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neutralization of TNFalpha overexpression using anti-TNFalpha or anti-TNF receptor 1 antibodies abolished the increased activity of caspase-2, caspase-8 and caspases-3, -6 and -7 in M-Tw osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These studies provide novel evidence that Twist haploinsufficiency in SCS promotes osteoblast <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by a TNFalpha-caspase-2-caspase-8-caspases-3, -6, -7 cascade, and uncover a molecular mechanism in which Twist plays an anti-apoptotic role in human calvarial osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
