These anatomic patterns are usually reported to occur in about 11% of whites and 20-25% of blacks and have been reported to have increased frequency in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002575'>tracheoesophageal fistula</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DGS">DiGeorge anomaly</z:e>, and anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery </plain></SENT>
