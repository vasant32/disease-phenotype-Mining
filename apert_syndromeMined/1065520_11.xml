<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A post-mortem examination of a 22-month-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A linear coronal craniectomy performed at 11 months of age had fused completely in spite of the insertion of <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> film between the bony edges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> of other cranial sutures was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the cranial base showed that the sphenofrontal suture was fused and that the entire cerebral surface, including the sella turcica, was characterized by bone resorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sphenooccipital synchondrosis was extremely wide and abnormally shaped, and the chondral growth activity seemed diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the patient exhibited primary as well as secondary growth distrubances in the calvarium and cranial base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The premature <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> of the coronal and sphenofrontal sutures and the anomaly of the sphenooccipital synchondrosis were interpreted as primary defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The altered shape of the calvarium and the marked resorption and shortening of the cranial base were considered secondary changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the investigation indicated that the conventional linear coronal craniectomy cannot be expected to improve the craniofacial growth pattern in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternative surgical procedures were suggested </plain></SENT>
