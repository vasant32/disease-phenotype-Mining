<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) have been associated with a number of such conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the cellular mechanism(s) involved remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed cell proliferation and differentiation in osteoblasts obtained from patients with three genetically and clinically distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e>: Pfeiffer syndrome carrying the FGFR2 C342R substitution, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> with FGFR2 P253R change, and a nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> without FGFR canonic mutations, as compared with control osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Osteoblasts from craniosynostotic patients exhibited a lower proliferation rate than control osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P253R and nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> osteoblasts showed a marked differentiated phenotype, characterized by high alkaline phosphatase activity, increased mineralization and expression of noncollagenous matrix proteins, associated with high expression and activation of protein kinase Calpha and protein kinase Cepsilon isoenzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the low proliferation rate of C342R osteoblasts was not associated with a differentiated phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although they showed higher alkaline phosphatase activity than control, C342R osteoblasts failed to mineralize and expressed low levels of osteopontin and osteonectin and high protein kinase Czeta levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of proliferation and inhibition of differentiation were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cultures on FGF2 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that an anticipated proliferative/differentiative switch, associated with alterations of the FGFR transduction pathways, could be the causative common feature in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and that mutations in distinct FGFR2 domains are associated with an in vitro <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> differentiative phenotype </plain></SENT>
