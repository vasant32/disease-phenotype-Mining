<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) 1 and 3 have distinct mitogenic activities in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In several cultured cell lines, FGFR1 transmits a potent mitogenic signal, whereas FGFR3 has little or no mitogenic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in other in vitro assays the FGFR3 intracellular domain is comparable with that of FGFR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo, FGFR3 negatively regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, and activating mutations are the molecular etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, FGFR1 transmits a proliferative signal in various cell types in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that inhibition of the proliferating chondrocyte could be a unique property of FGFR3 or, alternatively, a unique property of the proliferating chondrocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, FGFR1 signaling was activated in the growth plate in cells that normally express FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of transgenic mice with an activated FGFR1 signaling pathway with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>-like mouse that expresses a similarly activated FGFR3 signaling pathway demonstrated that both transgenes result in a similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that suppression of mitogenic activity by FGFR signaling is a property that is unique to growth plate chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we observed that in transgenic mice expressing an activated FGFR, some synovial joints failed to develop and were replaced by cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The defects in the digit joints phenocopied the symphalangism that occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and the number of affected joints was dependent on transgene dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the phenotype in the growth plate, the joint phenotype was more severe in transgenic mice with an activated FGFR1 signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The failure of joint development resulted from expanded chondrification in the presumptive joint space, suggesting a crucial role for FGF signaling in regulating the transition of condensed mesenchyme to cartilage and in defining the boundary of skeletal elements </plain></SENT>
