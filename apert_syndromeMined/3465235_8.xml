<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This was a cephalometric study of maxillary growth following LeFort III osteotomy in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, and Pfeiffer (CAP) syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen children who had undergone LeFort III advancement osteotomies were followed postoperatively for an average of 5.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data for horizontal and vertical maxillary growth increments were obtained and compared with data of a control group of unoperated CAP children and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that horizontal maxillary growth following surgical treatment is negligible (less than 0.1 mm/yr), and differs from unoperated CAP children (0.7 mm/yr) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children (1.3 mm/yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vertical maxillary growth following surgery is identical to that in unoperated CAP and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children, amounting to 1.3 mm/yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LeFort III osteotomy during childhood is a justifiable procedure for physiologic and psychologic reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Horizontal maxillary growth, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> practical purposes, is eliminated by this procedure and a subsequent maxillary advancement is invariably required at the completion of growth </plain></SENT>
