<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Signalling by fibroblast growth factor receptor type 2 (FGFR2) normally involves a tissue-specific alternative splice choice between two exons (IIIb and IIIc), which generates two receptor isoforms (FGFR2b and FGFR2c respectively) with differing repertoires of FGF-binding specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a unique chimeric IIIb/c exon in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, generated by a non-allelic homologous recombination event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We present a child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> in whom routine genetic testing had excluded the FGFR2 missense mutations commonly associated with this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was found to harbour a heterozygous 1372 bp deletion between FGFR2 exons IIIb and IIIc, apparently originating from recombination between 13 bp of identical DNA sequence present in both exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement was not present in the unaffected parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on the known pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, the chimeric FGFR2 protein is predicted to act in a dominant gain-of-function manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is likely to result from its expression in mesenchymal tissues, where retention of most of the residues essential for FGFR2b binding activity would result in autocrine activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report adds to the repertoire of rare cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> for which a pathogenesis based on atypical FGFR2 rearrangements can be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
