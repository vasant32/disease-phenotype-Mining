<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the volume changes of the upper airway and the respiratory outcome following midface (Le Fort I or III) or monobloc advancement in ten syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> patients are evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperatively, the airway volume was measured using a semi-automatic region growing method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Respiratory data were correlated to the volume measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nine patients the outcome of upper airway volume measurements correlated well to the respiratory outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients showed a minimal airway volume gain or even volume loss, and no respiratory improvement was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one monobloc patient improvement of the respiratory outcome without an evident volume gain of the upper airway was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with Le Fort III advancement showed respiratory improvement, which for the greater part correlated to the results of the volume analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In monobloc patients the respiratory outcomes and volume measurements were less obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preoperative endoscopy of the upper airway is advocated to identify the level of obstruction in patients with residual obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
