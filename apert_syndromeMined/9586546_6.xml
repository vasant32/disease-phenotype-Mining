<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects included 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e>, 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e>, and 3 patients with Pfeiffer's syndrome, as well as two control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genomic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> of each patient was extracted, and the mutation sites of the FGFR2 gene were amplified and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> showed a FGFR2 mutation of S252W (TCG--&gt;TGG), 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e> had a mutation of C342W (TGC--&gt;TGG), and the 3 patients with Pfeiffer's syndrome had mutations of T341P (ACG--&gt;CCG), C342S (TGC--&gt;<z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi>), and D321A (GAC--&gt;GCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of FGF families and the effect of FGFR2 mutations on craniofacial morphogenesis are discussed </plain></SENT>
