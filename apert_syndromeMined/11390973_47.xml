<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two activating mutations, Ser-252 --&gt; Trp and Pro-253 --&gt; Arg, in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) account for nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known cases of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism by which these substitutions cause AS, we determined the crystal structures of these two FGFR2 mutants in complex with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These structures demonstrate that both mutations introduce additional interactions between FGFR2 and FGF2, thereby augmenting FGFR2-FGF2 affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, based on these structures and sequence alignment of the FGF family, we propose that the Pro-253 --&gt; Arg mutation will indiscriminately increase the affinity of FGFR2 toward any FGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the Ser-252 --&gt; Trp mutation will selectively enhance the affinity of FGFR2 toward a limited subset of FGFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These predictions are consistent with previous biochemical data describing the effects of AS mutations on FGF binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alterations in FGFR2 ligand affinity and specificity may allow inappropriate autocrine or paracrine activation of FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the distinct gain-of-function interactions observed in each crystal structure provide a model to explain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> among AS patients </plain></SENT>
