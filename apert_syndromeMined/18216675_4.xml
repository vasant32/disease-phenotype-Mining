<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aesthetic and function problems arising from this can be corrected by frontofacial advancement, either by monobloc or bipartition osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significantly larger, safer advancements can be achieved using distraction osteogenesis when compared to conventional osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the stability of this technique has been questioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> who underwent frontofacial advancement osteotomies using the rigid external distractor system was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve were distracted on protocol 1 (24 hours after surgery at 1.5 mm/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine were distracted on protocol 2 (7 days after surgery at 1 mm/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 6-week consolidation period was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in frontofacial advancement in the sagittal plane were measured preoperatively, immediately, at 6 months, and where possible thereafter annually using lateral cephalograms and three-dimensional computed tomography scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The midface was distracted an average of 16.4 mm with a range of 12 to 22 mm as measured in the sagittal plain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relapse was seen only in 3 of 21 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients were distracted using protocol 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Distraction osteogenesis of the frontofacial skeleton using the rigid external distractor frame is generally stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this series, a longer latency period and reduced distraction rate resulted in greater stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overdistraction in the growing infant is recommended to allow for completion of growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overdistraction is not needed to compensate for potential relapse </plain></SENT>
