<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that Twist is expressed in the coronal suture during development, and therefore that it may play an important role in development and maintenance of the suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Twist-null mouse is lethal before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of osteogenesis, and the heterozygote exhibits coronal suture <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> postnatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the function of Twist in the development of the mouse coronal suture, by inhibiting Twist synthesis using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides in calvarial organ culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreased Twist production resulted in a narrow sutural space and fusion of bone domains within 48 h after the addition of the morpholino oligonucleotides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation activity in the sutural cells was decreased, and the expression of osteogenic marker genes such as Runx2 and Fgfr2 was up-regulated in the developing bone domain within 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that during establishment of the suture area, Twist is required for the regulation of sutural cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation </plain></SENT>
