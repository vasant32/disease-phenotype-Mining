<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study addresses this gap and explores speech, language, resonance/voice, attention <z:chebi fb="39" ids="29287">oro</z:chebi>-motor and cognitive skills in a group of 10 children (4;1-5;11) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The speech and language battery included: the CELF-Pre-school, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>-3, the Vocal Profile Analysis, GOS.SP.ASS, PACS; and the Brodsky <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>Drooling</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subscales of the BAS II-Early Years Version were used to assess cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were also collected on other factors that could influence developmental outcome such as audiological history and management; occlusion/dentition; respiratory problems and management; neuroanatomical abnormalities; the number and nature of cranial surgeries; and the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children for whom a Performance IQ was obtained (n = 8) had abilities within the average range and IQ scores were considerably higher than those reported in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight children had moderate or severe language difficulties and expressive language difficulties were the most frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These language difficulties were not associated with a general <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abnormal voice</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, a range of other associated factors that could affect functioning were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The discrepancies between the current study and previous investigations are outlined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Parameters for assessment are considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The implications of these findings for valid assessments of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Multidisciplinary assessment of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> across a broad range of dimensions is recommended to obtain a profile of each child's strengths and weaknesses to ensure that appropriate educational placements and early interventions are implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Considering patterns of development over time at key ages is also argued to be of central importance </plain></SENT>
