<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there has been no systematic examination for the management of the difficult pediatric airway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively examined the incidence of difficult airway in 13,557 pediatric patients who had undergone general anesthesia with tracheal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difficulties of the intubation were classified into grade 1 to 4; grade 1: intubated one time, grade 2: two times, grade 3: three times or more, grade 4: changed to another way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We defined grade 3 and 4 as "difficult airway" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (0.17%) are "difficult airway" among 13,557 patients in which 21 patients (0.15%) are classified as grade 3, and 4 patients (0.02%) are grade 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difficulties were significantly different among the syndromes (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of the incidence in the difficulty is high in Treacher Collins syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis</z:hpo> multiprex congenita and first and second brachial arch syndrome, but few is in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031900" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Pierre-Robin syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> which are known to accompany difficult airway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the incidence of difficult airway is different among the syndromes </plain></SENT>
