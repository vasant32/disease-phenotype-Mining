<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective evaluation was carried out to define the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and associated factors in 44 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> treated at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto over a 22-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-three of these patients underwent cranioorbital decompressive procedures within 1 year of birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 25 (60%) patients who had either a computed tomography scan or pneumoencephalogram had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo>, and 3 of the 25 (12%) had associated brain anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 44 (23%) patients had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts placed, 7 lumboperitoneal and 3 ventriculoperitoneal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of the shunts were placed early after cranioorbital procedures (CSF leaks in 5 cases and a subgaleal fluid collection in 1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average IQ of 15 patients evaluated by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale was 72.5, indicative of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>intellectual impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between IQ and ventricular size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> characterized by progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> is uncommon in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, postoperative problems related to impaired CSF circulation are common and may indicate an underlying CSF absorptive deficit </plain></SENT>
