<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Patients submitted to surgical advancement of the upper and middle facial third might have a relapse of the skeletal retraction after the removal of the distractor devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical signs related to this process are usually represented by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>Obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000303'>prognathism</z:hpo>; however, the analytic definition of the relapse is very difficult , conventional cephalometric methods being influenced by the spatial movement of "N" (nasion) or "Or" (orbital) points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors present a new cephalometric technique that could be used as a more objective mean of follow-up evaluation of patients undergoing craniofacial advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cephalometric analysis proposed is based on angles, lines, areas and distances between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32590">BaS</z:chebi> (Basion-Sella) axis and other craniofacial landmark points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have defined this cephalometric technique as "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32590">BaS</z:chebi> Analysis" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32590">BaS</z:chebi> analysis" is not influenced by splanchnocranium movements in the space; for this reason, it can be considered a useful method for cephalometric analysis in the follow-up of patients with craniofacial malformations </plain></SENT>
