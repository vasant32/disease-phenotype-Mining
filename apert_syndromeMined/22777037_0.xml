<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its premature fusion has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo> in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed computed tomographic scans of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> and Muenke syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo>, to assess premature fusion of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety head computed tomographic scans of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> patients and 31 head scans of Muenke syndrome patients were assessed, in addition to an equal number of control scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spheno-occipital synchondrosis fusion on axial images was graded as open, partially closed, or closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis focused on ages 7 to 14 years, as no control patient fused before age 7 or had failed to fuse after age 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 38 Apert syndrome patients aged 7 to 14 had some degree of spheno-occipital synchondrosis closure, compared with 29 of 38 matched controls (p = 0.0023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of 20 Muenke syndrome patients showed closure, compared with 14 of 20 matched controls (p = 0.4506) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Partial fusion was seen as early as age 2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and age 6 in Muenke syndrome patients; the earliest fusion was seen at age 7 in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with matched controls, the spheno-occipital synchondrosis closes significantly earlier in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> but not Muenke syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This correlates well to reported incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo> in these syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although causality cannot be concluded from this study, an association exists between midface phenotype and degree of spheno-occipital synchondrosis closure </plain></SENT>
