<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Wnt signaling is essential for many developmental processes, including skeletogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effects of Wnt signaling during skeletogenesis we studied the effects of Wnt on cultured chondrocytic cells and differentiating limb-bud mesenchyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We showed that Wnt3a strongly repressed chondrogenesis and chondrocyte gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Canonical Wnt signaling was responsible for the repression of differentiation, as evidenced by results showing that inhibition of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3 or expression of beta-catenin caused similar repression of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly, we showed that the transcription repressor Twist1 is induced by canonical Wnt signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of Twist1 strongly inhibited chondrocyte gene expression and short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> knockdown of Twist1 transcript levels caused increased expression of the chondrocyte-specific genes aggrecan and type II collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Twist1 interfered with BMP2-induced expression of aggrecan and type II collagen expression and knockdown of Twist1 augmented BMP2-induced aggrecan and type II collagen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the conclusions that Twist1 contributes to the repression of chondrogenesis and chondrocyte gene expression resulting from canonical Wnt signaling and that Twist1 interferes with BMP-dependent signaling </plain></SENT>
