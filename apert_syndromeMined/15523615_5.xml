<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mutational spectrum tends to be narrow with the majority of mutations occurring in either exon IIIa or IIIc or in the intronic sequence preceding exon IIIc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations outside of this hotspot are uncommon and the few identified mutations have demonstrated wide clinical variability, making it difficult to establish a clear-cut genotype-phenotype correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To better delineate the clinical picture associated with these unusual mutations, we describe a severely affected patient with Pfeiffer syndrome and a missense mutation in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
