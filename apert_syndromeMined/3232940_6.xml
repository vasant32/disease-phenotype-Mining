<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of this congenital anomaly could not be verified in this series because the number of cases was limited and the cause could not be concluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The less frequent site of constriction band was the thumb, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">acrocephalosyndactyly</z:e> was the most common associated anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 30 cases were treated with surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-stage Z-plasty encircling the limb was performed for those with pure constriction band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">acrocephalosyndactyly</z:e> were treated with staged separation of the digits as well as local flap and skin grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Good results were achieved in 16 of 20 patients with constriction band alone and in 4 of 10 acrosyndactyly cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No compromised circulation of the distal limb or total flap loss was encountered in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This type of surgery certainly gives encouraging results </plain></SENT>
