<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> hand is complex and numerous procedures are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to propose a strategy for hand management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> hands were submitted to early surgery which included opening of the first web, separation of the fingers, realignment of the thumb and correction of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006253'>clinodactylies</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed an average of six operations per child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the first web depended on the classification of Upton: for the severe stages, we used a dorsal hand flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radical <z:mp ids='MP_0006253'>clinodactyly</z:mp> was treated by osteotomy of the delta phalanx and Z-plasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We treated nine hands with four fingers and seven hands with five fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was always bilateral opposition and symphalangism, excluding the fifth finger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the children have a rudimentary but functional pinch grip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Revision of the webs was necessary in 16% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> hand requires early and specialised treatment that aims to provide a functional hand before two or three years, with the least surgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The functional prognosis is darkened by symphalangism </plain></SENT>
