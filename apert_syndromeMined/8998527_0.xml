<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>POPULATION AND METHODS: Sixty patients (32 males, 28 females) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient age at the last examination was over 3 years (mean 10 years, range 3-28 years) in 38 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IQ was assessed from psychometric tests adapted for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> was studied by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age at operation and quality of familial environment were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IQ was over 70 in 12 patients (32%), over 90 in five (13%) and the mean IQ was 62 (10-114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent of patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001273'>abnormalities of the corpus callosum</z:hpo>, 43% of the cerebral ventricles and 55% of the septum pellucidum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no anomaly in 28% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One or more operations were performed in 53 patients, before one year of age in 37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten children were institutionalized or in deleterious family situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The main factor influencing the mental prognosis was the age at operation: the final IQ was over 70 in 50% of the children operated on before one year of age versus 8% in those operated on later (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only the anomalies of the septum pellucidum seemed to play a role: 50% of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> septum had an IQ &gt; 70 compared to 18% in those with septum anomalies (P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The quality of the familial environment also influenced the mental development: 12.5% of the patients who were institutionalized or in difficult familial situation had an IQ &gt; 70 compared to 39% of those who live in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Careful investigation including MRI is necessary for detecting associated brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The patients must be operated on early, if possible before the age of nine months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Attention has also to be paid to quality of the sociofamilial environment </plain></SENT>
