<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The records of 76 patients were reviewed, 27 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, 47 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e>, and two with Pfieffer's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 172 operations, 148 were done for cosmetic reasons, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, or papillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, and 24 were done for airway distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty patients (23%) were children less than 13 years of age, and 22 underwent midface advancement procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 13 of these operations had been done for airway distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two were cured by operation and seven improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After operation had failed to relieve the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e>, a nasal continuous positive airway pressure device (nCPAP) was fitted to seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nCPAP relieved or improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> recorded by a sleep study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As midface advancement in childhood rarely results in lasting improvement in breathing or aesthetics, it may well be advisable to postpone operation until the early teens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that with nCPAP operation can in most cases be deferred until a time when a permanent result can be achieved </plain></SENT>
