<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of a large number of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and multiple splice forms of their receptors (FGFRs) in higher vertebrates makes the three-dimensional (3D) analysis of FGF interactions with their receptors a formidable task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The situation differs in Caenorhabditis elegans (worm) and Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), where only one or two FGF and FGFR sequences have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Structural studies of the FGF-FGFR complexes in such primitive organisms should reveal the basic features of the ligand-receptor interactions as they first emerged through evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have analysed the sequences of worm and fly FGFs and FGFRs and used the recently determined crystal structure of the human FGF1-FGFR2-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> ternary complex [Pellegrini, L., Burke, D.F., von Delft, F., Mulloy, B. and Blundell, T.L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2000) Nature 407, 1029-34] to construct 3D models of the homologous complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In spite of a low sequence similarity with their human counterparts, key structural features required for ligand-receptor and protein-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding in humans are conserved in the fly and worm FGF-FGFR-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the models show that tertiary interactions that are not conserved in sequence are maintained through novel interactions or complementary mutations in the fly and worm sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall charge distributions observed in the human FGF-FGFR-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> complex are retained in the fly and worm models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residue</z:chebi> at position 253 in the linker region between the Ig-like domains D2 and D3 in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> fly and worm sequences is particularly striking, as the Pro253Arg mutation in humans is responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This change may enhance the affinity of receptors for their FGF molecules as observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> mutants </plain></SENT>
