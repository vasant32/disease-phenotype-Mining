<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A paternal-age effect and the exclusive paternal origin of mutations have been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> (AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> AS births increases exponentially with paternal age, we hypothesized that the frequency of AS mutations in sperm would also increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the frequency of two common FGFR2 mutations in AS, we developed allele-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48021">peptide nucleic acid</z:chebi>-PCR assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyzing sperm DNA from 148 men, age 21-80 years, we showed that the number of sperm with mutations increased in the oldest age groups among men who did not have a child with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These older men were also more likely to have both mutations in their sperm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, this age-related increase in mutation frequency was not sufficient to explain the AS-birth frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the mutation frequency observed in men who were younger and had children with AS was significantly greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, our data suggest selection for sperm with specific mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, contributing factors to the paternal-age effect may include selection and a higher number of mutant sperm in a subset of men ascertained because they had a child with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No age-related increase in the frequency of these mutations was observed in leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Selection and/or quality-control mechanisms, including DNA repair and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, may contribute to the cell-type differences in mutation frequency </plain></SENT>
