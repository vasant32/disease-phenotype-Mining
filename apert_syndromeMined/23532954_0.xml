<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of cases are caused by heterozygous mutations in the third immunoglobulin-like domain (IgIII) of FGFR2, whilst a small number of cases can be attributed to mutations outside this region of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A mild form of Pfeiffer syndrome can rarely be caused by a specific mutation in FGFR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on the clinical and genetic findings in a three generation British family with Pfeiffer syndrome caused by a heterozygous missense mutation, p.Ala172Phe, located in the IgII domain of FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported case of this particular mutation since Pfeiffer's index case, originally described in a German family in 1964, on which basis the syndrome was eponymously named </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis demonstrated the two families to be unrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarities in phenotypes between the two families are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Independent genetic origins, but phenotypic similarities in the two families add to the evidence supporting the theory of selfish spermatogonial selective advantage for this rare gain-of-function FGFR2 mutation. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
