<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike the majority of FGFR2 mutations, S252W and P253R AS mutations and a D321A PS mutation retain ligand-dependency and are also associated with severe limb pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a recently identified ligand-dependent S252L/A315S double mutation in FGFR2 was shown to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyze the effect of the canonical AS mutations, the D321A PS mutation and the S252L/A315S double mutation on FGFR2 ligand binding affinity and specificity using surface plasmon resonance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both AS mutations and the D321A PS mutation, but not the S252L/A315S double mutation, increase the binding affinity of FGFR2c to multiple FGFs expressed in the cranial suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four pathogenic mutations also violate FGFR2c ligand binding specificity and enable this receptor to bind FGF10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on our data, we propose that an increase in mutant FGFR2c binding to multiple FGFs results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, whereas binding of mutant FGFR2c to FGF10 results in severe limb pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Structural and biophysical analysis shows that AS mutations in FGFR2b also enhance and violate FGFR2b ligand binding affinity and specificity, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that elevated AS mutant FGFR2b signaling may account for the dermatological manifestations of AS </plain></SENT>
