<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Base substitution mutations are far more common in human males than in females, and the frequency increases with paternal age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both can be accounted for by the greater number of pre-meiotic cell divisions in males, especially old ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, small deletions do not show any important age effect and occur with approximately equal frequency in the two sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in most genes include both types, and the sex and paternal age effect depends on the proportion of the two types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A few traits, of which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert Syndrome</z:e> is best understood, are mutation hot spots with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the mutations occurring in one or two codons, usually at one nucleotide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They occur with very high frequency almost exclusively in males and the frequency increases rapidly with paternal age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the mutant cells have a selective advantage in the male germ-line prior to meiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evidence for this surprising, but important, hypothesis is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A possible mechanism is the conversion of asymmetrical stem-cell divisions into symmetric ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some traits with complex etiology show a slight paternal age effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is also a short discussion of the high deleterious mutation rate and the role of sexual reproduction in reducing the consequent mutation load </plain></SENT>
