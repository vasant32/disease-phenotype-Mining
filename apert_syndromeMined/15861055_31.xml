<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 5-year period, 51 Le Fort III osteotomies were performed; 41 of these were by halo distraction for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, 25; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, nine; Pfeiffer syndrome, four; other, three) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient records were reviewed and 104 cephalograms were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average treatment age was 8 years, and the average hospitalization was 5.3 days (3.6 days for the second half of this series) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average distraction was 26 mm (range, 14 to 44 mm), the sella-nasion-subspinale angle increased from 70 degrees to 87 degrees, the upper incisal edge advanced 18 mm, and the vertical distance between nasion and point A increased by 7 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no maxillary relapse at 1 year and no measurable forward maxillary growth for up to 5 years, although the maxilla did grow vertically (p &lt; or = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent tracheostomy removal; sleep studies showed the average respiratory disturbance index improved from 24 to 11 (p = 0.004) and the minimum oxygen saturation increased from 81 to 89 (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three early patients had incomplete advancements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The maxilla remained stable after Le Fort III halo distraction without any relapse, and no anterior growth was observed up to 5 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This procedure effectively eliminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> in most children, and had a low overall complication rate that declined with experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most distracted patients will likely avoid the traditional second Le Fort III </plain></SENT>
