<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This procedure, through highly complex, has had some significant associated complication, such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage, <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and bone resorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distraction has been successfully used to gradually elongate bone and soft tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method seems to provide improved results over conventional surgery, with less morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> who underwent monobloc advancement using the Rigid External Device (RED) device and who developed a transient bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amaurosis</z:e> on the fourth postoperative day before distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second procedure was performed to push back the frontal bandeau, maintaining the device in position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> was resolved with this procedure as well as treatment with systemic steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distraction was started thereafter, and the desired improvement was acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first case of transient bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amaurosis</z:e> in a patient undergoing monobloc distraction </plain></SENT>
