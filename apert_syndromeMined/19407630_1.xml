<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Monobloc distraction has been demonstrated to be an efficacious, safe, and stable method of providing functional and aesthetic improvement in children with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the movement of bony structures following monobloc distraction has been quantitatively assessed before, objective analysis of the movement of soft tissues, such as the globe, has not been published previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors present a method that assesses globe movement following monobloc distraction, using computed tomographic scan data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The preoperative and postoperative computed tomographic scans of 10 patients with Pfeiffer's and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndromes</z:e>, undergoing monobloc distraction, were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scan data were loaded into voxel image-rendering software that produced a three-dimensional reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct measurements between preoperative and postoperative images were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An average upper face osseous distraction distance of 12.94 mm, with an average lower face distraction of 14.19 mm, was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors measured average globe movements on three planes and calculated an average left eye forward movement of 5.28 mm and average right eye forward movement of 6.33 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, globe advancement was approximately two fifths of the distance advanced by the surrounding bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Forward movement of the globe following monobloc distraction has not previously been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although there is no current evidence for optic nerve stretch and compromise in monobloc surgery, the functional implications of these findings should be formally assessed </plain></SENT>
