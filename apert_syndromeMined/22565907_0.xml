<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) scan images have given the opportunity to compare with accuracy the real anatomic changes and potentially the functional improvements that resulted after a surgical treatment.Three-dimensional CT scan images processed by DICOM files in Dolphin 3D Software were used to assess orbital volume and surface in 12 subjects affected by craniofacial syndromic malformations treated with Le Fort III advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preoperative (T0) and postoperative (T1: 6 months after surgery) three-dimensional craniofacial CT scans of the subjects were collected and retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Image segmentation of the anatomic orbital cavity and the three-dimensional graphic rendering were done by using the Dolphin Imaging Plus 11.0 software.The orbital volume was increased after surgery, with statistical significance, from 22,267 to 22,706.3 mm(3) in the right eye and from 26,511 mm(3) to 26,256.4 mm(3) in the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surface of both bony orbits had an expansion, which is statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study showed that the orbital advancement in white subjects after Le Fort III advancement was significant and produced a significant augmentation of the orbital volume and surface area with correction of the ocular bulb <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
