<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The MNM angle is defined as the angle between the intersection of the maxilla-nasion and mandible-nasion lines in the exact mid-sagittal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After assessing reproducibility, the MNM angle was measured in 3D volumes in 241 fetuses cross-sectionally and in 11 fetuses longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MNM angle was then tested in 18 pathological cases with facial malformations or syndromes with specific facial features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MNM angle could be measured in 92.3% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intra- and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) variability was 0.92 and 0.81, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference between paired measurements performed by one or two observers was less than 2.5° and 3.6°, respectively in 95% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean MNM angle was 13.5° and did not change significantly during pregnancy (r = - 0.08, P = 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MNM angle was above the 95(th) centile in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000278'>retrognathia</z:hpo> and maxillary alveolar ridge interruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MNM angle was below the 5(th) centile in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and in two of the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility and reproducibility of measurement of the MNM angle is good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The MNM angle can be used to evaluate the convexity of the fetal profile by enabling an objective assessment of the anteroposterior relationship of the jaws and it may therefore be of help in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000278'>retrognathia</z:hpo>, maxillary alveolar ridge interruption and flat profile </plain></SENT>
