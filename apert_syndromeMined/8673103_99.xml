<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of new mutations, estimated as 1 per 65,000 live births, implies germline transversion rates at these two positions are currently the highest known in the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a novel application of the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS), we have determined the parental origin of the new mutation in 57 Apert families: in every case, the mutation arose from the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This identifies the biological basis of the paternal age effect for new mutations previously suggested for this disorder </plain></SENT>
