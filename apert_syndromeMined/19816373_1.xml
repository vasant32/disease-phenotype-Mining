<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reossification of the cranium and zygomatic bone in monobloc frontofacial advancement with distraction has not been assessed previously on long series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 40 patients, 22 Crouzon, 11 Apert, and 7 Pfeiffer syndrome who underwent a frontofacial monobloc advancement by distraction osteogenesis, were retrospectively reviewed, after a mean of 2.1 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bone linkage between both margin of the coronal and zygomatic osteotomy gap was evaluated on three-dimensional computed tomographic scan postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlations between reossification and some clinical situations (diagnosis, existence of previous anterior craniofacial procedure, use of bone paste, and the age at operation) were studied to determine factors that influence on reossification. "Good" or "fair" reossification on coronal gap was demonstrated by 68.2% of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and 54.5% of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 85.7% of those with Pfeiffer syndrome had "poor" or "absent" reossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rebridging of the zygomatic arch in Pfeiffer was also the poorest among 3 syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previous operations performed before the frontofacial monobloc advancement decreased reossification of distraction gap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients in whom autologous bone paste on coronal osteotomy gap was applied, the bone formation was improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> syndromes significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reossification of the coronal osteotomy gap in patients with Pfeiffer syndrome is poor compared with those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bone paste is extremely effective on increasing osteogenesis even in patients with Pfeiffer syndrome or the patients with previous surgery </plain></SENT>
