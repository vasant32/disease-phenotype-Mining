<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: In this study the authors investigated whether patterns of intracranial venous drainage in children with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) were abnormal and, thus, could support the theory that venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is a major contributor to raised ICP that can lead to impaired visual function or even <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors analyzed the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of intracranial venous drainage as demonstrated in the results of 24 angiography studies obtained in 23 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had either a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>-related syndrome (18 patients) or a nonsyndromic multisutural <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> (five patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had experienced raised ICP (in 19 patients diagnosis was based on invasive ICP monitoring and in two patients on clinical grounds alone) 1 to 6 weeks before undergoing angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the two remaining patients (both with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>) whose ICP monitoring was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immediately before angiography, each had undergone two previous cranial vault expansion procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On results of 18 angiography studies a 51 to 99% stenosis or no flow at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> could be observed in the sigmoid-jugular sinus complex either bilaterally (11 patients) or unilaterally (seven patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 11 of these patients a florid collateral circulation through the stylomastoid emissary venous plexus was also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two angiography studies were performed in one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the two studies demonstrated a progression of the abnormal venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> in that case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors found no obvious correlation between each patient's baseline ICP and the degree of abnormality of their venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, as judged on the basis of a venous-phase angiography severity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on their findings, the authors assert that in children with complex forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> in whom other factors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, are absent, abnormalities of venous drainage that particularly affect the sigmoid-jugular sinus complex produce a state of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> that, in turn, is responsible for the majority of cases of raised ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of these changes is unknown, but an analysis of the ages of the children in this study indicated that the period of particular vulnerability to the effects of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> lasts until the affected child is approximately 6 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After that age the collateral venous drainage through the stylomastoid plexus will likely become sufficient to allow ICP to normalize </plain></SENT>
