<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiologic examinations showed malformations at the level of the calvarium, the base, orbital cavities, and, sometimes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002813'>limb abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlations between these findings and the microradiographic analysis of nondemineralized sections elucidate this trilobular appearance of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Premature temporoparietal suture closure terminates at a constricted surface of the lateral sides of the skull during the fetal life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extension of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> to coronal and frontal sutures and thickening of the occipital bone squama block lengthening of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The consecutive reduction in skull volume is compensated by the maintenance of the permeability during the neonatal period of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microradiographic examination shows that this anomaly may be of vascular origin and associated with abnormal osteoclastic resorption </plain></SENT>
