<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genealogical studies and estimation of population incidence of individual malformations are also necessary for diagnosis of genic syndromes of MCM and identification of new syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An etiological classification of MCM and that of genic syndromes of MCM are considered on the basis of isolation of similar clinical forms, which are of important for differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
