<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Both monobloc and facial bipartition distraction are important tools for correcting functional and aesthetic problems in patients with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional computed tomographic reconstructions have become increasingly useful in planning and analyzing surgical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study measured the differential deformation of the facial skeleton following distraction osteogenesis with the rigid external distractor frame, looking especially at correction of the midface concavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correction of the midface concavity aims to not only improve the appearance but also increase the upper airway volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten children with syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> underwent monobloc distraction and three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> underwent facial bipartition distraction using the rigid external distractor frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients' ages ranged from 4 months to 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The medial advancement and the lateral advancement of the facial skeleton were compared by landmarking three-dimensional computed tomographic reconstructions using the sella turcica as the fixed point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To compare the shape of the monobloc segment from the preoperative to postoperative scans, a color map was generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the seven patients who underwent monobloc distraction, the mean medial advancement of the face was 4.9 mm greater than the lateral advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With the bipartition distraction, the mean central area advancement was 11.4 mm farther than the lateral aspect of the facial skeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both monobloc and in particular the facial bipartition distraction differentially advance the central part of the face more than the lateral areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This bending of the face appears to have both cosmetic and functional advantages </plain></SENT>
