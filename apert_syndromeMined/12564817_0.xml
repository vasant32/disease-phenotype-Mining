<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> (syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> with symmetrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo>) and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010442'>polydactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a small fixator with a ball joint and successfully corrected the angular deformity after lengthening the proximal phalanx by distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This single inclusive procedure was extremely useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found the optimal distraction regimen for the digital phalanx was a one day waiting period and lengthening at 1 mm/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean healing indexes were 37.2 days/cm (range 24.2 to 41.5) in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and 64.3 days/cm in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010442'>polydactyly</z:hpo> (62.5 and 66.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that osteogenesis at the distraction site may be quicker in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010442'>polydactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
