<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although considerable phenotypic overlap exists, these syndromes are considered by most investigators to be the result of different (although possibly allelic) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes the clinical and roentgenologic manifestations in a family wit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">acrocephalosyndactyly</z:e> (ACS) showing considerably variation in phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two different types of ACS were clinically identified in this single family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proband presented with the classic stigmata of Pfeiffer syndrome while her cousin was considered to be a typical case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further family study revealed that, in addition to these two individuals, seven other family members also have unusually shaped heads and have the facial appearance remiscent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hand and foot anomalies were seen clinically in some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the observations made in this family and from previous reports in the literature, we feel that there is a substantial reason to reevaluate the ACS classification and to consider that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> and Pfeiffer types of ACS may be one and the same </plain></SENT>
