<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are usually found as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> finding with limited clinical symptoms but may cause concern for parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They can occur spontaneously or be inherited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral acromial dimples may occasionally be present as part of more complex syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article reports an 18-month-old girl with congenital bilateral acromial dimples and presents a classification of this unusual entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A literature review of English and non-English publications was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report the second case of bilateral acromial dimples seen in the context of maternal cocaine use during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our case is probably <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and nonsyndromal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that bilateral acromial dimples be classified as syndromal or nonsyndromal and that nonsyndromal cases be subdivided into inherited and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although bilateral acromial dimples can be seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0432443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">18q deletion syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, Say syndrome, and a recently described syndrome in Brazil, our review of the literature does not support the association with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 9 syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dermatologists need to be aware of this unusual cutaneous finding and potential syndromal associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The significance of the association with fetal exposure to cocaine during pregnancy has yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The biological mother was not available for assessment for bilateral acromial dimples </plain></SENT>
