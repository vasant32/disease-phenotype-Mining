<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndrome further characterized by distinctive facial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002813'>limb abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It shows complete penetrance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable expressivity</z:hpo> and has been linked to the TWIST gene on chromosome 7p21; more than 80 different intragenic mutations and, recently, large deletions have been detected in Saethre-Chotzen patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to genetically and phenotypically characterize patients with a clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis as well as those with a genetic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> (n = 34) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study showed that the important features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> (occurring in 74 percent of patients), a broad, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005280'>depressed nasal bridge</z:hpo> (65 percent), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000348'>high forehead</z:hpo> (56 percent), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> (53 percent), and prominent auricular crura (56 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using different molecular techniques, pathogenic mutations in the TWIST gene were identified in 71 percent of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with deletions of the TWIST gene did not differ from those with intragenic TWIST mutations in frequency or severity of craniofacial abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, they did distinguish themselves by the presence of many additional anomalies and diseases and--most importantly--the high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, which was borderline significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that when using stringent inclusion criteria for studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, patients who have a pathogenic mutation of the TWIST gene should be excluded </plain></SENT>
