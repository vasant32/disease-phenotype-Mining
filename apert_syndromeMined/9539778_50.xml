<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Multiple human skeletal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> disorders, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, Pfeiffer, Jackson-Weiss, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndromes</z:e>, result from numerous point mutations in the extracellular region of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of these mutations create a free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi> that potentially leads to abnormal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond formation and receptor activation; however, for noncysteine mutations, the mechanism of receptor activation remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of two of these mutations, W290G and T341P, on receptor dimerization and activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mutations resulted in cellular transformation when expressed as FGFR2/Neu chimeric receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in full-length FGFR2, the mutations induced receptor dimerization and elevated levels of tyrosine kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, transformation by the chimeric receptors, dimerization, and enhanced kinase activity were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abolished if either the W290G or the T341P mutation was expressed in conjunction with mutations that eliminate the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond in the third immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate a requirement for the Ig-3 cysteine residues in the activation of FGFR2 by noncysteine mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Molecular modeling also reveals that noncysteine mutations may activate FGFR2 by altering the conformation of the Ig-3 domain near the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond, preventing the formation of an intramolecular bond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This allows the unbonded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> to participate in intermolecular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonding, resulting in constitutive activation of the receptor </plain></SENT>
