<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are created to guide the mobile bone segments into position based on the ideal or planned dental and facial relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For conventional orthognathic cases and maxillofacial trauma scenarios involving the dentition, a nasal endotracheal tube is required, allowing the teeth to be closed into intermaxillary fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in situations where access to the nasal cavity is required, such as concurrent rhinoplasty, or when higher osteotomies involving the midface are performed requiring advancement or manipulation of the nasal region, the nasal tube needs to be converted into an oral tube (J Clin Anesth 2011;23:342) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This requires time and inconvenience and is a potentially dangerous maneuver in the setting of existing surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, fluids, and manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report on a novel oral splint design allowing for both intermaxillary fixation to be established using an oral endotracheal tube while allowing for manipulation of the midface via the nasal cavity and not requiring a tube change intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
