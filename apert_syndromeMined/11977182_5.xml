<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large Indian family has been recently identified as carrying a nonsense TWIST mutation (Q28 X) in 17 members, of whom 16 were examined in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 4 (25%) of the patients showed patent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e>, namely, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000263'>oxycephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The penetrance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> in this family is lower than previously reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (93%) had moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor limb and external ear abnormalities were present in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eyelid features were the hallmark of the disease for 12 members of the family, suggesting that mutations in TWIST may lead to a phenotype with mainly palpebral features and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical analysis of this large family clearly illustrates the significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable expressivity</z:hpo>, probably related to haploinsufficiency because of the TWIST mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> remains unclear but could be the result of modifier genes and/or genetic background effect, as noticed previously in the transgenic twist-null heterozygous mice </plain></SENT>
