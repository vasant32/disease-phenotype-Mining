<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Affected persons have extensive structural and functional impairments, some of which can be life threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Management requires team care from infancy to adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this article are to assess the outcomes in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> after completion of treatment and to review current protocols for craniofacial team care and dental, orthodontic, and orthognathic surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 8 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cephalograms at 2 time points were compared: adolescence (before midface advancement) and at least 1 year after advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cephalometric values were compared with paired t tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Team protocols are delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Measurements indicating forward positioning of the maxilla increased significantly: SNA by 10.7° (P = 0.002) and midface length by 9.6 mm (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sagittal jaw relationship improved significantly as well: ANB by 14° (P = 0.004) and the Wits appraisal by 8 mm (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vertical dimensions also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals had significantly improved and stable positions of the midface and normalized facial profiles after treatment </plain></SENT>
