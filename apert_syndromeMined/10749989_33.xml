<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated recently that mutations in H-TWIST account for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS)</z:e>, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndrome characterized by premature fusion of coronal sutures and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002813'>limb abnormalities</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable severity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although insertions, deletions, nonsense and missense mutations have been identified, no genotype-phenotype correlation could be found, suggesting that the gene alterations lead to a loss of protein function irrespective of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess this hypothesis, we studied stability, dimerization capacities and subcellular distribution of three types of TWIST mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that: (i) nonsense mutations resulted in truncated protein instability; (ii) missense mutations involving the helical domains led to a complete loss of H-TWIST heterodimerization with the E12 bHLH protein in the two-hybrid system and dramatically altered the ability of the TWIST protein to localize in the nucleus of COS-transfected cells; and (iii) in-frame insertion or missense mutations within the loop significantly altered dimer formation but not the nuclear location of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that at least two distinct mechanisms account for loss of TWIST protein function in SCS patients, namely protein degradation and subcellular mislocalization </plain></SENT>
