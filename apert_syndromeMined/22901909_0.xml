<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive children with craniofacial syndromes, including both bony deformities of the skull and face, in which a bronchoscopy was performed between 1995 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (22 boys, 14 girls; mean age, 39 months) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> was present in 21 patients (Crouzen syndrome, 11; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, 7, Pfeiffer syndrome, 3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> in 15 (Goldenhart syndrome, 8; Treacher Collins syndrome, 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 30 patients (83.3%), bronchoscopy was performed because of respiratory symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apneic episodes</z:hpo>, 22; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo>, 13; <z:hpo ids='HP_0010307'>stridor</z:hpo>, 6; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo>, 1) and, in the remaining 6 (asymptomatic children), during guided tracheal intubation before a surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Airway anomalies were found in 69.4% of patients (70% in symptomatic patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Management consisted of tracheotomy in 13 patients, adenoidectomy/tonsillectomy in 13, glossopexy in 5, antireflux surgery in 3, and supraglottoplasty in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Airway anomalies occurred in 70% of children with severe craniofacial syndromes and respiratory symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bronchoscopy should be performed routinely in this selected group of patients, and the entire airway must be examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment should be tailored to each individual patient </plain></SENT>
