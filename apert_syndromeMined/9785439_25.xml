<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 6-month-old boy with multiple premature <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e> and extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0000262'>turricephaly</z:hpo> underwent surgery of limited extensiveness but supplemented with a set of indwelling springs for gradual postoperative skull reshaping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At spring removal three months later the skull was normalised both clinically and on cephalogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 5-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011800'>midface retrusion</z:hpo>, exorbitism, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> underwent a monobloc full face disjunction without repositioning, but was fitted with two springs for postoperative facial advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three months postoperatively cephalometric analysis revealed 14 mm advancement at incisor level and at least 16 mm in the frontal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no more exorbitism or clinically noticeable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011800'>midface retrusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sleep studies revealed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> was significantly improved, meaning complete cure except when sleeping flat on the back </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was concluded from these first clinical applications of spring assisted craniofacial distraction that springs hold significant promise for the future in many respects </plain></SENT>
