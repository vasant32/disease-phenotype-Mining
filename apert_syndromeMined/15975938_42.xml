<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of affected individuals have a S252W mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the pathogenesis of this condition, we generated a knock-in mouse model with this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Fgfr2(+/S252W) mutant mice have abnormalities of the skeleton, as well as of other organs including the brain, thymus, lungs, heart and intestines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the mutant neurocranium, we found a midline sutural defect and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> with abnormal osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We noted <z:mp ids='MP_0003869'>ectopic cartilage</z:mp> at the midline sagittal suture, and cartilage abnormalities in the basicranium, nasal turbinates and trachea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, from the mutant long bones, in vitro cell cultures grown in osteogenic medium revealed chondrocytes, which were absent in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that altered cartilage and bone development play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
