<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene have been associated with several <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> conditions including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, Jackson-Weiss, and Pfeiffer syndromes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the mutational spectrum in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is remarkably narrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations detected thus far in Caucasian patients with this syndrome are exclusively transversions from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> at either nucleotide position 934 (C934G) or 937 (C937G) in the FGFR2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To examine the possibility that the narrow mutational spectrum in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> was a result of racial or environmental predilection, we studied three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> patients from two unrelated Japanese families for C934G and C937G mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The C934G mutation was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration of FGFR2 gene mutations in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our evidence that the C934G mutation identified in Caucasian patients also occurs among Japanese patients excludes the possibility of racial or environmental predilection for this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide position 934 is a mutational hotspot of the FGFR2 gene in Japanese patients as well, although the mechanism by which the mutation occurs remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether C937G is a mutational hotspot in Japanese patients as well remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
