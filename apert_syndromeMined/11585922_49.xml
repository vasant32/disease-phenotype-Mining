<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the involvement of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors in differentiation of osteoblasts using the human osteoblastic cell line MG63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum starvation induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> at G1 phase, accompanied by expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/Cip1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reporter assays with the p21 gene promoter demonstrated that the combination of E2A (E12 or E47) and coactivator CBP was responsible for p21 induction independent of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twist inhibited E2A-CBP-dependent activation of the exogenous and endogenous p21 promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ids similarly inhibited the exogenously transfected p21 promoter; however less antagonistic effect on the endogenous p21 promoter was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twist was predominantly present in nuclei in MG63 cells growing in complete medium, while it localized mainly in the cytoplasm after serum starvation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), which generates signals leading to differentiation of osteoblasts, was found to be controlled by the same transcriptional regulation as the p21 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>E2A and Twist influenced alkaline phosphatase expression, a consensus marker of osteoblast differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of E2A and FGFR3 was seen at the location of osteoblast differentiation in the calvaria of mouse embryos, implicating bHLH molecules in physiological osteoblast differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that a common regulatory system is involved in at least two distinct steps in osteoblastic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results also provide the molecular basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, caused by mutations of the TWIST and FGFR3 genes </plain></SENT>
