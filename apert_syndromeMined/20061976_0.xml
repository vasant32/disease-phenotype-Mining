<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Pyrexia</z:hpo> after surgical procedure is a commonly observed phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not easy to distinguish <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> related to a postoperative complication from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> temperature increase after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to establish a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> template for postoperative temperature course after transcranial surgery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and to investigate the correlation between the pattern of temperature increase and etiological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-seven sequential case notes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> were retrospectively reviewed to collect postoperative temperature courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean change of temperature was plotted on a graph with trend line to compare the feature of the course in each possible factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A separate group of those who underwent fronto-orbital advancement was independently evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The temperature course had a bimodal distribution during the first 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, those who underwent longer surgery, fronto-facial advancement, or those accompanied by complication seemed to have the more obvious third temperature peak around 50 hours postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding was also true in the independent fronto-orbital advancement group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Temperature courses without postoperative complication seemed to have bimodal distribution of temperature course; on the other hand, those with postoperative complication seemed to have the obvious third temperature peak around postoperative 50 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Together with our previous study, it was concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> after transcranial surgery had a bimodal distribution as a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> course within the first 48 hours postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was suggested that the third temperature peak around 50 hours postoperatively could be an indicator for a postoperative complication </plain></SENT>
