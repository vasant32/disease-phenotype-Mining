<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic tertiary care pediatric hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Eleven patients with Pfeiffer syndrome, 6 of whom were severely affected, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of tracheal anomalies, need for tracheotomy, and length of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 6 severely affected patients had mutations in genes that code for fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (S351C [3 patients]; C342S [2 patients]; and W290C [1 patient]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of these patients were diagnosed during bronchoscopy or tracheotomy as having a congenital tracheal cartilaginous sleeve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, supportive care was withdrawn at 2 weeks of life, and the patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining 5 patients required tracheotomy because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients died (at ages 9 months and 7 and 15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two are still alive at ages 23 and 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Pfeiffer syndrome manifest significant airway pathologic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>Upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001742'>nasal obstruction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Tracheal anomalies have been infrequently reported </plain></SENT>
