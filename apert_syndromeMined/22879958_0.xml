<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous analyses of DNA from randomly selected cadaveric testes showed that the levels of the corresponding FGFR2, FGFR3 and RET mutations exhibit very uneven spatial distributions, with localised hotspots surrounded by large mutation-negative areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies imply that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> testes are mosaic for clusters of mutant cells: these clusters are predicted to have altered growth and signalling properties leading to their clonal expansion (selfish spermatogonial selection), but DNA extraction eliminates the possibility to study such processes at a tissue level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a panel of antibodies optimised for the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_319'>spermatocytic seminoma</z:mpath>, a rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> of spermatogonial origin, we demonstrate that putative clonal events are frequent within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> testes of elderly men (mean age: 73.3 yrs) and can be classed into two broad categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found numerous small (less than 200 cells) cellular aggregations with distinct immunohistochemical characteristics, localised to a portion of the seminiferous tubule, which are of uncertain significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However more infrequently we identified additional regions where entire seminiferous tubules had a circumferentially altered immunohistochemical appearance that extended through multiple serial sections that were physically contiguous (up to 1 mm in length), and exhibited enhanced staining for antibodies both to FGFR3 and a marker of downstream signal activation, pAKT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings support the concept that populations of spermatogonia in individual seminiferous tubules in the testes of older men are clonal mosaics with regard to their signalling properties and activation, thus fulfilling one of the specific predictions of selfish spermatogonial selection </plain></SENT>
