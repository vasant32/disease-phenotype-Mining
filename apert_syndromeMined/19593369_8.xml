<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of this disease increases with the age of the father (paternal age effect), and this increase is greater than what would be expected based on the greater number of germ-line divisions in older men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We use a highly sensitive PCR assay to measure the frequencies of the two causal mutations in the sperm of over 300 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors with a wide range of ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutation frequencies increase with the age of the sperm donors, and this increase is consistent with the increase in the incidence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both the sperm data and the birth data, the increase is non-monotonic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, after normalizing for age, the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> mutation frequencies are correlated within individual sperm donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We consider a mathematical model for germ-line mutation which reproduces many of the attributes of the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This model, with other evidence, suggests that part of the increase in both the sperm data and the birth data is due to selection for mutated premeiotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is likely that a number of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> have similar features </plain></SENT>
