<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>Craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, the premature fusion of 1 or more sutures of the skull, is a common congenital defect, with a prevalence of 1 in 2500 live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Untreated progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> leads to inhibition of brain growth and increased intracranial and intraorbital pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of clinical phenotypes and the overlap of the various associated syndromes render the correct diagnosis of the different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e> particularly difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To identify 10 common mutations in the genes for fibroblast growth factor receptors 2 and 3 (FGFR2 and FGFR3), we developed a microelectronic microchip assay that exploited the PCR multiplexing format and coupled it with serial addressing and probe hybridization on the same pad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the molecular characterization of patients who tested negative in the microchip screening, we also developed conditions for denaturing HPLC (DHPLC) analysis of the most mutated regions of FGFR2 and FGFR3 and the entire coding region of the TWIST1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our cohort of 159 patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes, mutations were found in 100% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, 83.3% with Pfeiffer syndrome, 72.7% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, 50.0% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, 27.7% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>plagiocephaly</z:hpo>, 31.8% with brachicephaly, 20% of complex cases, and 6.9% of mixed cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found in syndromic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combined microchip-DHPLC strategy allows rapid and specific molecular diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and is an effective tool for the medical and surgical management of these common congenital anomalies in a newborn or an infant with a developmental defect of the cranial vault </plain></SENT>
