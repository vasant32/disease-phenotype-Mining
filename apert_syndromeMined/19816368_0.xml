<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some surgeons believe that midface advancement can improve respiratory outcome dramatically, but others think it does not predictably result in the cure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the structural and functional changes of the upper airway before and after Le Fort III DO; we hope these studies can improve future protocols for midface advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of 11 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011800'>midface retrusion</z:hpo> who underwent Le Fort III osteotomy with midface external distractor system was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients had an average of 5.4 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional volumetric assessment of the upper airway was used before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the two-dimensional cross-sectional area of the upper airway to show the changes in different airway levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients with preoperative evidence of OSA were evaluated both preoperatively and postoperatively by overnight polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The midface was distracted for an average of 20.27 +/- 8.04 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison between preoperative and postoperative three-dimensional computed tomographic data showed an average 64.30% increase in upper airway volume, an improvement of 9.13 +/- 6.94 mL (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The two-dimensional measurement also showed that the cross-sectional area at the posterior nasal spine and uvula airway level increased (P &lt; 0.05), but the cross-sectional area at the epiglottis level and the separation of airway and esophagus level did not increase (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients with preoperative evidence of OSA had both preoperative and postoperative sleeping studies that showed improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Le Fort III DO can significantly improve the upper airway space in the cases of syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The upper airway space above the uvula level was significantly enlarged after Le Fort III DO according to two-dimensional and three-dimensional image measurements, and according to the polysomnography, the OSA was alleviated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Le Fort III DO is a promising procedure in the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011800'>midface retrusion</z:hpo> with OSA in young patients </plain></SENT>
