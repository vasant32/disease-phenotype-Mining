<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling is an important mechanism regulating osteoblast function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain an insight into the regulatory role of FGF receptor-2 (FGFR2) signaling in osteoblasts, we investigated integrin-mediated attachment and cell survival in human calvarial osteoblasts expressing activated FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FGFR2 activation reduced osteoblast attachment on fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was associated with reduced expression of the alpha5 integrin subunit normally expressed in human calvarial osteoblasts in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52722">lactacystin</z:chebi>, a potent inhibitor of proteasome, restored alpha5 integrin levels in FGFR2 mutant osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that alpha5 integrin interacts with both the E3 ubiquitin ligase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> and ubiquitin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry revealed that alpha5 integrin colocalizes with FGFR2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> at the leading edge in membrane ruffle regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transfection with the 70Z-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> mutant lacking the RING domain required for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>-ubiquitin interaction, or with the G306E <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> mutant that abolishes the binding ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> phosphotyrosine-binding domain restored alpha5 integrin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>-mediated ubiquitination plays an essential role in alpha5 integrin proteasome degradation induced by FGFR2 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced alpha5 integrin expression was associated with an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and increased caspase-9 and -3 activities in FGFR2 mutant osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forced expression of alpha5 integrin rescued cell attachment and corrected both the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities in FGFR2 mutant osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> recruitment induced by FGFR2 activation triggers alpha5 integrin degradation by the proteasome, which results in reduced osteoblast attachment on fibronectin and caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This identifies a functional role of the alpha5 integrin subunit in the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> triggered by FGFR2 activation in osteoblasts, and reveals that a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>-dependent mechanism is involved in the coordinated regulation of cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by alpha5 integrin degradation </plain></SENT>
