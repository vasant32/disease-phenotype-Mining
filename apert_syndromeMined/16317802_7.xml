<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the possible association of skull deformity and the development of the cranial sutures in fetuses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound was used to examine the metopic and coronal sutures in seven fetuses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> at 22-27 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gap between the frontal bones in the transverse plane of the head at the level of the cavum septi pellucidi was measured and compared to findings in 120 anatomically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetuses undergoing routine ultrasound examination at 16-32 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, the gap between the frontal bones in the metopic suture at the level of the cavum septi pellucidi, decreased significantly with gestation from a mean of 2.2 mm (5th and 95th centiles: 1.5 mm and 2.9 mm) at 16 weeks to 0.9 mm (5th and 95th centiles: 0.3 mm and 1.6 mm) at 32 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the seven cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, two-dimensional ultrasound examination demonstrated the characteristic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002007'>frontal bossing</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005280'>depressed nasal bridge</z:hpo> and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On 3D examination there was complete closure of the coronal suture and a wide gap in the metopic suture (15-23 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetuses, cranial bones are believed to grow in response to the centrifugal pressure from the expanding brain and proximity of the dura to the suture is critical in maintaining its patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002007'>frontal bossing</z:hpo> may be a mere consequence of a genetically predetermined premature closure of the coronal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, there is a genetically predetermined deformation of the brain, which in turn, through differential stretch of the dura in the temporal and frontal regions, causes premature closure of the coronal suture and impaired closure of the metopic suture </plain></SENT>
