<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About 85% of the affected patients present de novo mutations in the TBX5 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to propose a molecular strategy to diagnose patients with clinical suspicion of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="37859">HOS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A sequence analysis of 7 patients from exon 2 to exon 8 of the TBX5 gene was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MLPAp179 and MLPAp180 were performed in those cases in which no mutation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p.Arg270X and p.Ala34Glyfsx27 mutations were identified in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cases fulfilled the strict clinical criteria, had a family history of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="37859">HOS</z:chebi> and had similar clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In other three cases, MLPA results showed deletions of the GLI3 coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In order to increase the TBX5 mutation detection rate, an exhaustive physical examination focused on the strict clinical criteria may be necessary to rule out clinical overlapping syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that molecular analysis of GLI3 may be performed in patients with clinical suspicion of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="37859">HOS</z:chebi> without mutations in TBX5 </plain></SENT>
