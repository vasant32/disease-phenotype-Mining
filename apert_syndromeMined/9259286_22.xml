<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The TWIST gene maps to 7p21 and mutations in the gene have been reported in the Saethre-Chotzen form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The position of the Saethre-Chotzen gene has previously been refined by FISH analysis of four patients carrying balanced translocations involving 7p21 which suggested that it was located between D7S488 and D7S503 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that the breakpoints in four translocation patients do not interrupt the coding sequence of the TWIST gene and thus most likely act through a positional effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve Saethre-Chotzen cases were found to have TWIST mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of these families had been used as part of the linkage study of the Saethre-Chotzen locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutations detected included missense and nonsense mutations and three cases of a 21 bp duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although phenotypically diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, three families were found to have a pro250arg mutation of FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
