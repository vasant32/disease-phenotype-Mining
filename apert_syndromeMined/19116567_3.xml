<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> deformity are known to have high morbidity and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physical anomalies include a misshapen, trilobar skull, with a high "bossed" forehead, a bulging temporal region, and a flat posterior skull from multiple cranial suture fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> deformity treated at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1990 to 2006 (n = 14) underwent early cranial vault remodeling (group 1) or staged correction with ventriculoperitoneal shunt (neonate), fronto-orbital advancement (3 to 6 months), and posterior vault remodeling (1 year) (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morbidity, necessary revisions, and neurologic (developmental testing) and aesthetic (Whitaker score) outcomes were assessed at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnoses included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, Pfeiffer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">syndrome, Saethre-Chotzen</z:e> syndrome, and nonsyndromic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early cranial vault remodeling patients had more complications than staged correction patients [<z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, and excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (each 66 percent versus 9 percent); wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (66 percent versus 18 percent); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (100 percent versus 0 percent)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early cranial vault remodeling patients had prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stays compared with staged correction patients (13 versus 2 days and 27 versus 5 days, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Whitaker score showed acceptable results at 18 months in group 2 (1.4, no revisions necessary) but not in group 1 (2.8, minor to major bony recontouring) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Developmental tests showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> early cranial vault remodeling patients had lower scores in both preschool tests and global evaluations compared with normative data (mean preschool receptive scores, 95 versus 85; mean preschool expressive scores, 94 versus 87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Staged correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> provided acceptable neurologic and aesthetic outcomes in the authors' series of patients </plain></SENT>
