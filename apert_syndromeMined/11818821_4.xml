<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reconstructive dilemmas consist of shortened, deviated phalanges and extensive skin deficits following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a 10-year review of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">acrocephalosyndactyly</z:e> who were treated with a simplified surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between 1986 and 1996, 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> underwent reconstructive surgery of their hands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall strategy involved early bilateral separation of syndactylous border digits at 1 year of age, followed by sequential unilateral middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> mass separation with thumb osteotomy and bone grafting as needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these 10 patients, a total of 53 web spaces were released, 49 of which involved osteotomies for complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only local flaps and full-thickness skin grafts from the groin were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases to achieve soft-tissue coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To date, seven of the 53 web spaces have needed revision (revision rate, 13 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven thumb osteotomies (nine opening wedge and two closing wedge) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bone grafts from the proximal ulna or from other digits were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To date, none of these thumb osteotomies have needed revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This early, simplified approach to the complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001155'>hand anomalies</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">acrocephalosyndactyly</z:e> has been successful in achieving low revision rates and excellent functional outcomes as measured by gross grasp and pinch and by patient and parent satisfaction </plain></SENT>
