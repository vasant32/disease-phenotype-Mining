<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have generated a mouse model (Fgfr2(+/P253R)) mimicking human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> resulting from fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 Pro253Arg mutation using the knock-in approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This mouse model in general has the characteristic skull <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> similar to that in humans with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To characterize the detailed changes of form in the overall skull and its major anatomic structures, euclidean distance matrix analysis was used to quantitatively compare the form and growth difference between the skulls of mutants and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were substantial morphological differences between the skulls of mutants and their controls at 4 and 8 weeks of age (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutants showed shortened skull dimensions along the rostrocaudal axis, especially in their face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The width of the frontal bone and the distance between the two orbits were broadened mediolaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurocrania were significantly increased along the dorsoventral axis and slightly increased along the mediolateral axis, and also had anteriorly displayed opisthion along the rostrocaudal axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, the mutant mandible had an anteriorly displaced coronoid process and mandibular condyle along the rostrocaudal axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We further found that there was catch-up growth in the nasal bone, maxilla, zygomatic bone and some regions of the mandible of the mutant skulls during the 4-8-week interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The above-mentioned findings further validate the Fgfr2(+/P253R) mouse strain as a good model for human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The changes in form characterized in this study will help to elucidate the mechanisms through which the Pro253Arg mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 affects craniofacial development and causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
