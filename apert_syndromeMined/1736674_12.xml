<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A biological form consists of size and shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several approaches for comparing biological forms using landmark data are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If the two biological forms are demonstrated to be different, the next important issue is to localize the differences by identifying those areas which differ most between the two objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper we suggest a technique to detect influential landmarks, those which contribute most to the difference between forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We study the effectiveness of the technique using three-dimensional simulated data sets and two examples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that the technique is useful in the study of biological form and its variation </plain></SENT>
