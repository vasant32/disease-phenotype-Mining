<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a clinically variable disorder and has been divided into three subtypes [Cohen, 1993: Am J Med Genet 45:300-307] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 1 represents the less severe cases, while types 2 and 3 are the more severe cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These latter types tend to have a higher risk for neurodevelopmental problems and a reduced life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we review the clinical course of seven children with PS type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these children had severe manifestations of PS; however, development was essentially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in three, mild delay was noted in two, and moderate delay in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcomes in children with types 2 and 3 PS were also documented by Moore et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>[1995: Cleft Pal-Craniofac J 32:62-70] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cases illustrate that while children with PS types 2 and 3 have an increased risk for neurodevelopmental difficulties, a favorable outcome can be achieved in some cases with aggressive medical and surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, although such management should be the rule for PS types 2 and 3, it needs to be remembered that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> outcome is not the rule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for favorable neurodevelopmental outcome and/or life expectancy remains guarded in most cases </plain></SENT>
