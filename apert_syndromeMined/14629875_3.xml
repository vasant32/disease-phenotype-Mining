<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite this, however, mutations cannot be identified in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study reports the first comprehensive screen of mutations in TWIST, FGFR-1, FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 genes in a cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has led to the identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> to be a new microdeletion disorder and reports the first example of a gene-environment interaction leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, investigation of the expression patterns of the Fgfr and Twist genes in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> developing mouse coronal suture has identified the TWIST protein to be important in cranial suture initiation and biogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings have significant clinical implications and will form the basis of future attempts to develop novel therapies aimed at inhibiting cranial suture fusion </plain></SENT>
