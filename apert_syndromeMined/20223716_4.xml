<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to assess the health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with syndromic or complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and to determine the impact of these syndromes on parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prospective study was performed in 111 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Health-related quality of life was measured by international standardised quality-of-life questionnaires, the Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire (ITQoL), Child Health Questionnaire Parental Form 50 (CHQ-PF50), Child Health Questionnaire Child Form 87 (CHQ-CF87) and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we used Dutch population norms of health-related quality-of-life-scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Parents' scores for patients with syndromic or complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> were significantly lower than those for the norm population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> had the largest impact on the different domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Scores on the CHQ-PF50 scales for 'physical functioning', 'parental impact emotional' and 'family activities' for these patients were significantly lower than scores for patients with other syndromes, possibly due to the complexity of the syndrome, which includes complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and behaviour problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Parents reported a reduced health-related quality of life for themselves, mostly psychosocial with clearly significantly lower general health perceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> has a large impact on the health-related quality of life of these children and their parents, both physical and psychosocial </plain></SENT>
