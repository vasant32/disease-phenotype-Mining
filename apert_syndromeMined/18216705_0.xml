<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that sequence variation in those exons predisposes toward developmental bone deformation, we assayed 160 children with nonsynostotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>plagiocephaly</z:hpo> by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No sequence variation was found, indicating that mutations in the "hot spot" exons are not associated with this common developmental condition; however, we did not assay most of the exons or related genes </plain></SENT>
