<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the advent of new internal devices, monobloc (M) and facial bipartition (FB) DO are feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rationale behind M and FB distraction is (1) gradual advancement of the M segment is not associated with a substantial retrofrontal dead space; (2) because 5 to 7 days elapse prior to distraction, the nasofrontal opening, in theory, is allowed to remucosalize; (3) gradual expansion of the soft tissues takes advantage of skin creep, potentially limiting relapse; (4) the procedure appears to be less invasive with decreased blood loss and operative time, enabling its use in infants; (5) overdistraction may eliminate or reduce the frequency of subsequent procedures; and (6) the procedure may be combined with FB and skull vault remodeling to provide excellent results in more complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five children underwent M advancement (N = 3) and M with FB (N = 2) at 9 months to 5 years of age to correct functional abnormalities such as corneal exposure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>, as well as severe craniofacial disfigurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent from 22 to 30 mm of distraction with the Modular Internal Distraction (MID) system, developed by the first author (SRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> late in the series along the DO cable track </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of epidural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MDO, with and without FB, appears to be a safe and effective technique for transcranial frontofacial advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The morbidity of the procedure appears to be less than that of conventional M advancement </plain></SENT>
