<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thin slice (2 mm), abutting, high resolution axial computed tomography (CT) foot scans were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CT data were post processed, using Analyze, to generate three-dimensional surface shaded and volumetric reformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reformatted images were evaluated by a bone and joint radiologist to identify abnormalities of bone shape, size, and orientation, of joint <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and of the foot as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five consistent findings were observed among the three pairs of feet: (1) anomalous great toes with phalangeal and metatarsal pathology; (2) simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001770'>syndactyly of toes</z:hpo> 2-5; (3) fusions between matatarsals; (4) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">tarsal coalitions</z:e>; and (5) limitations in commercial footwear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent bilateral fifth metatarsal wedge osteotomies to facilitate the wearing of shoes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dysmorphology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> foot is a combination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> and postnatal deformations, secondary to progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic foot surgery may be indicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> patients to facilitate shoe fitting </plain></SENT>
