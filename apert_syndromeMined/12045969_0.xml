<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e>, four of whom belonged to a three-generation family, were examined systemically, ophthalmologically and roentgenographically; five of these cases were additionally evaluated with computed tomography and compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On radiologic evaluation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases had <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cranial sutures and fontanelles and brachycephalic skulls, crowding of the upper teeth due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000327'>maxillary hypoplasia</z:hpo>, and serious nasal septum deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral ethmoidal, maxillary and sphenoidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011109'>chronic sinusitis</z:hpo> was found in 50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> and two others had a tendency toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The typical facial appearance with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000586'>shallow orbits</z:hpo>, globe protrusion and exorbitism was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of them had V-pattern <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo> while the other four were orthophoric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The single case with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> had bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e> can present with different findings and must be evaluated multidisciplinarly </plain></SENT>
