<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Skeletal fixation is a critical component of successful distraction osteogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a report on the development of a new approach to bone fixation for distraction osteogenesis of the midface, based on circumferential suspension of the entire midfacial skeleton using surgical wires placed through the soft palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique offers the advantages of (1) complete control of the attitude of the midface in terms of a precise dispersion of forces that can determine the desired pitch, yaw, and roll of this skeletal complex during the active phase of distraction, (2) being compatible with young children in the deciduous dentition stage because it obviates the need for rigid fixation devices on the maxillary lateral walls in the proximity of numerous dental follicles of the unerupted adult dentition, (3) actually serving as the instrument for posterior maxillary "lift" in cases of skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0010807'>open bite</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000689'>malocclusions</z:hpo> (frequently seen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e>), thereby allowing the clinician to determine the final occlusal and palatal planes and simultaneously close the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010807'>open bite</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An illustrative case of a 5(1/2)-year-old girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is presented wherein her ventilatory obstruction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>ocular proptosis</z:hpo> were significantly improved </plain></SENT>
