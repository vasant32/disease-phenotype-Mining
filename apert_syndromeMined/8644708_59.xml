<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, mutations were described in the exons IIIa and IIIc, which form the extracellular, third immunoglobulin-like domain (IgIII) and adjacent linker regions, both of which are normally involved in ligand binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three conditions, mutations were found in exon IIIc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> were mutations identified in exon IIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, 39 cases with one of these three conditions were screened for exon IIIa or IIIc mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven mutations are reported in 17 unrelated cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in exon IIIa are identified for not only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> but also Jackson-Weiss and Pfeiffer syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four mutations in either exon IIIa or exon IIIc reported only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> are present also in one of the other two syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two insertions, one in exon IIIa in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> patient and the other in exon IIIc in a Pfeiffer syndrome patient, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latter mutation has the same alternative <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing effect as a reported synonymous mutation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A missense mutation was detected in one Pfeiffer syndrome family in which two members had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> without limb anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The inter- and intrafamilial variability in expression of FGFR2 mutations suggests that these three syndromes, presumed to be clinically distinct, are instead representative of a spectrum of related craniosynostotic and digital disorders </plain></SENT>
