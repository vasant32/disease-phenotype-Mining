<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, they are used in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> in pediatric patients affected by Pfeiffer syndrome, where the resorption time of 1 year or less does not interfere with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the mechanism how <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53407">polylactide</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53492">polyglycolide</z:chebi> (PLPG) acid plates can induce osteoblast differentiation and proliferation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> osteoblasts and in osteoblasts derived from a patient with Pfeiffer syndrome, the expression levels of bone-related genes were analyzed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Osteoblasts grown on the PLPG acid plates resulted in significant upregulation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of many genes related to osteodifferentiation during the treatment, indicating that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53407">polylactide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53492">polyglycolide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33694">biopolymers</z:chebi> enhance proliferation, differentiation, and deposition of matrix in osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study also revealed some differences in gene expression between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> osteoblasts and osteoblasts derived from patients with Pfeiffer syndrome, cultivated on PLPG acid plates </plain></SENT>
