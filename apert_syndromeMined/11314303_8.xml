<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied this procedure in eight patients who were more than 5 years old with different types of craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> and who had not received previous treatment, and with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> frontal shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During monobloc advancement, major complications were encountered in older patients, especially the impossibility of the brain to expand rapidly to fill the retrofrontal dead space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distraction osteogenesis of the craniofacial skeleton en bloc (without craniectomy) is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Miniplates and screws are avoided as well as the possibility of frontal relapse or fractures of the frontozygomatic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients did not need skull vault remodeling, except for a small cranioplasty at the bregma zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results obtained were satisfactory and stable at the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This procedure avoids any kind of osteosynthesis, there is no extradural dead space, the operative time is brief, and blood loss is minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inconvenience is the necessity of a second operation to remove the distractor </plain></SENT>
