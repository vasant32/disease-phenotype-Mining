<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been used in adult patients for difficult airway management; however, there are few reports available on its use in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the use of the air-Q ILA in predicted difficult airway management in a 16-month-old patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> characterized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">acrocephalosyndactyly</z:e> undergoing a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was somewhat difficult to keep his airway with a facemask, and an air-Q ILA was inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the ventilation via air-Q ILA, tracheal intubation guided by a tracheal fiberscope was attempted through the air-Q ILA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five months after this operation, the patient again underwent the same operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We managed his airway in the same way as previously, and the tracheal was intubated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case shows that the air-Q ILA can be an alternative device in pediatric difficult airway management </plain></SENT>
