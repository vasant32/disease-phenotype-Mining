<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mutations have been identified rarely in cases of nonsyndromic, single suture <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, two studies confirming <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> with local expression of an FGFR mutation have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigates whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> could account for nonsyndromic, single suture <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight individuals with single suture <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> who were negative for known mutations in FGFR1-3 and TWIST after screening in their leucocyte DNA were tested for the presence of pathogenic mutations in suture cell-derived DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five had sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp>, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011330'>metopic synostosis</z:hpo>, and the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011315'>unicoronal synostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Osteoprogenitor cells from surgically excised fusing sutures and an adjacent open suture were cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA from the cultured cells grown to passage 3 was then examined for underlying FGFR and TWIST mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No mutations within the exons of the FGFR or TWIST genes studied were identified in any suture cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study found no evidence to support the notion that mosaicism for FGFR or TWIST mutations, normally associated with syndromal forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, occur in single suture <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, any underlying genetic defects must occur in regions outside those normally implicated in syndromal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, or this disorder could arise as a consequence of some other epigenetic modification </plain></SENT>
