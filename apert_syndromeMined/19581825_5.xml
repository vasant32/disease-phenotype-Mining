<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the cellular and molecular basis of this phenotype in a mouse model of AS (Fgfr2c(+/Delta) mice), which shows ectopic expression of Fgfr2b in mesenchymal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002777'>tracheal stenosis</z:hpo> is associated with increased proliferation of mesenchymal cells, where the expression of Fgf10 and its upstream regulators Tbx4 and Tbx5 are abnormally elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that Fgf10 has a critical inductive role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002777'>tracheal stenosis</z:hpo>, as genetic knockdown of Fgf10 in Fgfr2c(+/Delta) mice rescues this phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These novel findings demonstrate a regulatory role for Fgf10 in tracheal development and shed more light on the underlying cause of tracheal defects in AS </plain></SENT>
