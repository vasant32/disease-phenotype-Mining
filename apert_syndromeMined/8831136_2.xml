<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cenani-Lenz syndrome has been delineated as a type of complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> resembling the spoon hand seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, with as important additional feature, the fusion of metacarpals and disorganization of the phalanges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the observation of the syndrome in at least two affected siblings born to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parents and the consanguinity in one family <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo> was proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings in the present family could indicate that Cenani-Lenz syndrome may be genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another possible explanation could be that the occurrence in affected siblings born to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parents could be explained by gonadal mosaicism for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> gene </plain></SENT>
