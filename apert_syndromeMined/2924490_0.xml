<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This fact has been fully demonstrated in recent years by different authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An inconvenience of early correction of major craniofacial deformities is relapse at the maxillary level, mainly because of the lack of adequate dental occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rigid fixation methods have been used in surgical correction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> in order to preserve the position of the mobilized segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>'s cases conventional monoblock advancements were performed, using anchor wire osteosynthesis at the frontal region and two metal plates attached to the temporal bone to support the middle third of the face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> cases, a monoblock advancement modified by the facial bipartition concept was the selected procedure to obtain a three-dimensional correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because a midfacial vertical elongation was necessary, a third plate joins the hemi faces, fixing them to the intermediate frontal bar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Advantages of this method have been demonstrated over the past 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixteen children had a one-stage reconstruction by multiple osteotomies and extensive, combined mobilizations of the craniofacial complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Successful long-lasting corrections attest to the efficacy of this fixation method </plain></SENT>
