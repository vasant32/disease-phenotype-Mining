<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo> are often treated with Le Fort III advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors present four patients with extraordinarily long-term follow-up (in excess of 20 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with syndromic craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> who underwent Le Fort III advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with greater than 20 years of cephalometric and photographic records were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lateral cephalograms were obtained preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, at 1-year follow-up, and at long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cephalograms were traced, digitized, and averaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty cephalometric landmarks were identified for serial measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the four patients identified, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and three had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average age at the time of Le Fort III advancements was 11 years (range, 4 to 20 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average length of postoperative follow-up was 25 years (Â± 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient had significant anterior midfacial growth following Le Fort III advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both young patients (&lt;10 years) had substantial vertical inferior midfacial growth after advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the Le Fort III segment of children with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> does not grow significantly forward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the traditional Le Fort III osteotomy does not provide the amount of midface advancement necessary to avoid phenotypic recidivism in these syndromic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study also suggests that patients undergoing Le Fort III advancement appear to have zygomatic effacement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> of the overlying soft tissue with deepening of the facial folds; collectively, it is suggested that these changes give the appearance of accelerated facial aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, V </plain></SENT>
