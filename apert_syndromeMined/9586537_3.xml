<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedure requires a prolonged operating time, several osteotomies with a significant blood loss, and wide surgical exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the principles of bone lengthening, we performed midfacial advancement by bone distraction in 4 patients with midfacial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> to reduce the operative time and complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e> we performed a Le Fort III osteotomy and placed the distraction device behind the malar eminence and screwed it on the temporal bone bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other 2 children, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e>, we performed frontal advancement and remodeling before placing the device during the same surgery behind the malar bone without any midfacial osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It appears to us that patients with more severe deformities will need surgical procedures to offer more satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these patients, distraction is an initial therapy to reduce the severity of the deformity, making it possible to effect a better treatment afterward </plain></SENT>
