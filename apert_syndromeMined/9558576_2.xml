<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent genetic studies have shown that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> results from mutations of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We were interested in investigating the expression of FGF receptor 2 at the tissue level in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied FGF receptor activity in cranial sutures of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> and nonsyndromic, isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen children between the ages of 6 months and 12 months were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of these children had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> with coronal suture stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine children had an isolated, nonsyndromic coronal stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stenosed and nonstenosed cranial sutures were removed at the time of cranioplasty, fixed, decalcified, and paraffinized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed with labeled, specific anti-FGR receptor 2 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found lower levels of FGF receptor 2 staining in both stenosed and unstenosed sutures of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> compared with those from children with a nonsyndromic suture stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fused sutures from children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> demonstrated lower levels of FGF receptor 2 staining than unfused sutures from the same sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> correlates with low FGF receptor 2 activity in cranial sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with and similar to our findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e>, and support genetic studies showing localized mutational changes occurring at the FGF receptor 2 gene for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>'s and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the findings suggest the possibility that variable expression of FGF receptor 2 occurs at the tissue level in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
