<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our report deals with 8 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>'s and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndromes</z:e> followed longitudinally with roentgencephalometric examinations during the growth period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to analyze: presurgical facial growth, the displacement of the maxillary complex in connection with Le Fort III advancement, the stability of the surgical result, and postsurgical facial growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presurgical facial growth was characterized by lack of maxillary sutural growth and abnormal remodeling of the maxilla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surgical displacement of the maxilla consisted of an average advancement of about 10 mm and a backward rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maxilla remained stable following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, onlay bone grafts tended to resorb over the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postsurgical facial growth revealed lack of maxillary displacement with development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000303'>relative mandibular prognathism</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000689'>malocclusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it was concluded that the positive effects of early craniofacial surgery in patients with severe forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>'s and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndromes</z:e> outweigh these disadvantages </plain></SENT>
