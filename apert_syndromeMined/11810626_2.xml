<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The anomalous insertion of the abductor pollicis brevis tendon to the distal phalanx radially is released and reattached to the radial base of the proximal phalanx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A radial <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> joint capsulotomy is performed; excision of a cartilaginous prominence on the ulnar aspect of the metacarpal head is required to assist in joint alignment, which is temporarily maintained with a K-wire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two children underwent bilateral thumb reconstructions using this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 1.5 and 5.6 years after surgery the thumbs were straight and radiographs revealed no residual lateral angulation at the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> joint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The parents were satisfied with the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This technique of correction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>'s thumb radial angulation is simple and reliable and produces satisfactory clinical results </plain></SENT>
