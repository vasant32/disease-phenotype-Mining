<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In cases of surgery for syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> with posterior flattering, it is not possible to achieve sufficient expansion of the skull through fronto-orbital advancement alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is necessary to expand the occipital region, the surgery is risky and highly invasive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied the distraction osteogenesis technique for skull expansion and performed occipital expansion and fronto-orbital advancement in succession </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three patients with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> (2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, 1 with Pfeiffer syndrome) were treated in Juntendo University Hospital between 2002 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the distraction osteogenesis technique, we performed occipital advancement followed immediately by fronto-orbital advancement for 2 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> and performed fronto-orbital advancement followed by occipital advancement for a case of Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases, we were able to perform bone extension of 25 mm or more and achieve sufficient skull expansion for both of the frontal and occipital regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within 1 year after the surgery, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases, favorable osteogenesis was observed in the distraction gap, and there were no bone defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: By using the distraction osteogenesis technique, the difficult procedure of occipital advancement can be performed relatively safely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, as active expansion of the cranium is possible after the surgery, sufficient expansion of the cranium can be successfully performed to a degree that cannot be achieved through conventional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New bone is formed in the distraction gap, and there are no bone defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present method is extremely useful for skull formation in cases of syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> with posterior flattering </plain></SENT>
