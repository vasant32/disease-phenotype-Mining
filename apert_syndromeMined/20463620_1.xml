<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, and Pfeiffer syndromes who have severe midfacial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> are treated by Le Fort III midface advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine long-term (10-year) midface skeletal stability and growth following Le Fort III midface advancement in growing children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A review of 192 patients with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> treated by classic (nondistracted) Le Fort III advancement osteotomy between 1973 and 1998 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients met the inclusion criteria (age at surgery &lt; 11 years and availability of cephalograms of diagnostic quality before treatment, after surgery, and at 1-, 5-, and 10-year follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the time of surgery was 5.8 years and the diagnosis was either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> (n = 10), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> (n = 9), or Pfeiffer (n = 6) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After surgery, point A advanced sagittally 10.72 mm and moved downward 3.77 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, point A moved forward 0.10 mm and downward 0.47 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 5 years, point A moved back 0.18 mm, whereas at 10 years it advanced 0.12 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the same periods, however, pogonion came forward 5.72 mm and 7.32 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Le Fort III midface advancement in growing children with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> is stable after the first year postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is minimal horizontal growth of the midface between postoperative years 5 and 10, although the mandible continues to grow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Due to the differential growth rate of the midface and mandible, the facial profile becomes concave, thereby necessitating secondary midface surgery at the completion of skeletal growth </plain></SENT>
