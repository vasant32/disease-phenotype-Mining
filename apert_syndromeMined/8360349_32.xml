<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>12 Apert patients and 19 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age range was 0 to 23 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CT-scannings were carried out according to the same protocol with a slice thickness of 2 or 4 mm and 3-D reconstructions of the craniofacial region included midsagittal and horizontal cuts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of qualitative characteristics of the calvaria and cranial base were recorded and the cranial base angle was measured on the 3-D models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndromes</z:e> are very different in cranial development and their dysmorphology is highly age dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that cartilage abnormalities, especially in the anterior cranial base, play a primary role in cranial development in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> from very early intrauterine life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several cranial anomalies observed postnatally, however, are caused by the resultant dysmorphic and compensatory growth and are probably compounded by early cranial deformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary abnormality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> appears to be premature fusion of sutures and synchondroses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the findings at birth and early infancy it would seem that such fusions occur relatively late in fetal life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The adult cranial form in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>'s patients is explainable by resultant dysmorphic and compensatory growth changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Very early release of the coronal suture areas with advancement of the frontal bone is advocated in both syndromes but for somewhat different reasons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
