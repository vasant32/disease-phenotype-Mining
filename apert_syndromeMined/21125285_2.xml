<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study distraction osteogenesis of the posterior cranial vault in children requiring increased intracranial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients were treated with cranial distractors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five children had previously been operated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000268'>scaphocephaly</z:hpo> and one child for Saether-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Chotzen syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients had bilateral coronal suture <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> with Muenke syndrome and two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At surgery, the cranial bones were mobilized, the head was widened during surgery, and the segments fixed to each other with distractors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further expansion at a rate of 1 mm/day was performed over 2-4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cranium was distracted posteriorly from 20 to 30 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tolerated surgery and distraction well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the parents were able to perform the distraction at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no technical problems with the distraction devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two cases had minor cutaneous problems, where the distractor penetrated the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These cases responded to gentle local wound care measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the time of distractor removal, ossification had occurred sufficiently in one of these two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the other case, the device was removed and replaced with a resorbable plate, without any harmful effect on the result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, sufficient expansion was achieved without causing more cosmetic deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Ossification occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This method seems effective, as the calculated increase in intracranial volume was a mean of 20.2% (range 10.2-28.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary series shows that cranial bone distraction is a useful method for cranial expansion with low morbidity in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
