<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report four boys and a girl who were presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000243'>trigonocephaly</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011330'>metopic synostosis</z:hpo>, in association with pre- and post-axial <z:hpo ids='HP_0010442'>polydactyly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010554'>cutaneous syndactyly</z:hpo> of hands and feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cases had additional sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five children, the diagnosis of GCPS was confirmed by molecular analysis of GLI3 (two had intragenic mutations and three had complete gene deletions detected on array comparative genomic hybridisation), thus highlighting the importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000243'>trigonocephaly</z:hpo> or overt metopic or sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> as a distinct presenting feature of GCPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations confirm and extend a recently proposed association of intragenic GLI3 mutations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011330'>metopic synostosis</z:hpo>; moreover, the three individuals with complete deletion of GLI3 were previously considered to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275078,C1305108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Carpenter syndrome</z:e>, highlighting an important source of diagnostic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
