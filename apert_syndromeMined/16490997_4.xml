<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE AND METHODS: A 19-year-old woman was referred to us at 29 weeks of gestation for prenatal management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography of the fetus showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000825'>dilated lateral ventricles</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000158'>macroglossia</z:hpo>, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricle</z:hpo> of the heart in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed at 30 weeks of gestation and revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000825'>dilated lateral ventricles</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011304'>broad thumb</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fetal karyotyping indicated 46,XY, but DNA sequence analysis showed a single sequence variation (Nt 1198A&gt;G) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2 gene (exon 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, the baby was diagnosed in utero with Pfeiffer syndrome type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following counseling, the pregnancy was terminated because <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> made the patient's symptoms more severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient delivered her baby vaginally at 34 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The baby's birth weight was 2,298 g; the baby was declared dead at 25 min after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The detailed findings obtained by a combination of ultrasound that included three-dimensional and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and confirmation sought via molecular testing led to an accurate diagnosis of Pfeiffer syndrome type II in utero </plain></SENT>
