<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of cultured fibroblasts from patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e>, a rare connective disorder, differs from that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells in its extracellular matrix <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33839">macromolecule</z:chebi> composition (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi>, collagens and fibronectin) and is further modulated by treatment with interleukins (ILs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the mechanisms responsible for the changes are unknown, we used our recently described model system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> periosteal fibroblasts to ascertain whether the pattern of ILs they secrete into the medium is comparable to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) show that the levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> media, whereas levels of IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra), the natural inhibitor of IL-1, were markedly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-1 specific bio-activity on thymocyte proliferation was also decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As we provided also evidence that active transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta1), an IL-1 antagonist, was not secreted in greater amount in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> media with respect to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, the enhancement of IL-1ra appeared critical in down-regulating IL-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis of cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> revealed no detectable IL-1 or IL-6 gene expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts, but high amounts of IL-6 mRNA transcripts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the increased IL-6 gene expression did not translate into a parallel increase of secreted IL-6, the control of IL-6 secretion may be mainly post-transcriptional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the result that a treatment of the cultures with IL-1ra was able to induce a decrease of IL-6 secretion, suggests that the observed decreased secretion of IL-6 may be due to the autocrine action of overproduction of IL-1ra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed imbalance in the production of ILs which we show for the first time suggests ILs may be the natural autocrine regulators of ECM production in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that in vitro differences previously reported in fibroblast phenotypes and several clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> may correlate with different cytokine patterns </plain></SENT>
