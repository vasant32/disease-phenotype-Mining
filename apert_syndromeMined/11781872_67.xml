<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been known for several years that heterozygous mutations of three members of the fibroblast growth-factor-receptor family of signal-transduction molecules-namely, FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3-contribute significantly to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005940" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disorders of bone</z:e> patterning and growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FGFR3 mutations, which predominantly cause short-limbed bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three major regions (i.e., extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular) of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, most mutations described in FGFR2 localize to just two exons (IIIa and IIIc), encoding the IgIII domain in the extracellular region, resulting in syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, or Pfeiffer syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of this apparent clustering of mutations in FGFR2 has been hampered by the absence of any complete FGFR2-mutation screen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have now undertaken such a screen in 259 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> in whom mutations in other genes (e.g., FGFR1, FGFR3, and TWIST) had been excluded; part of this screen was a cohort-based study, enabling unbiased estimates of the mutation distribution to be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the majority (61/62 in the cohort sample) of FGFR2 mutations localized to the IIIa and IIIc exons, we identified mutations in seven additional exons-including six distinct mutations of the tyrosine kinase region and a single mutation of the IgII domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with atypical mutations had diagnoses of Pfeiffer syndrome or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, FGFR2 mutations were present in 9.8% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> who were included in a prospectively ascertained sample, but no mutations were found in association with isolated fusion of the metopic or sagittal sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the spectrum of FGFR2 mutations causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> is wider than previously recognized but that, nevertheless, the IgIIIa/IIIc region represents a genuine mutation hotspot </plain></SENT>
