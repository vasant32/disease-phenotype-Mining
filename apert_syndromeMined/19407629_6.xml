<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pfeiffer syndrome is rarely encountered, even at major craniofacial centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Published reports indicate high mortality rates (25 to 85 percent) for severely affected subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed their surgically treated patients to improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors conducted a 17-year, single-center, retrospective outcome assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children treated for Pfeiffer syndrome, with data summarized using descriptive statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 802 patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, 28 were identified with Pfeiffer syndrome: 17 were classified as type I (61 percent), seven were classified as type II (25 percent), and four were classified as type III (14 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 10 years (range, 12 months to 39 years), with an average of 9.3 operations per child (2.5 cranial vaults, 1.1 Le Fort III procedures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine percent had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000413'>external auditory canal atresia</z:hpo> (100 percent of type III patients), and 29 percent had some visual disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tracheostomies were recommended in 100 percent of type II and III patients, and two type II patients required <z:hpo ids='HP_0002777'>tracheal stenosis</z:hpo> repairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four percent had acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformations</z:hpo> (100 percent of type II and III patients), and 61 percent required treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of shunted patients (mean age, 7 years) have required Chiari decompressions, but no patients undergoing endoscopic third ventriculostomies (mean age, &lt;3 years) have required treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 7 percent, with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurring at home without proximity to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors' mortality rates for type II and III Pfeiffer syndrome are lower than those previously published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The authors believe a preemptory tarsorrhaphy strategy can prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and that further reductions in mortality rates are possible with aggressive airway management (early tracheostomies) and more frequent screening (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, sleep studies) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
