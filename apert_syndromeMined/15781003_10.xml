<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biologic activity of TWIST1 has been implicated in the inhibition of differentiation of multiple cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, premature fusion of cranial sutures (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>) in SCS may be mediated by altered differentiation of calvarial osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated osteoblasts derived from calvarial bone of three patients with SCS and three unaffected individuals as controls to investigate the principle stages of osteoblast differentiation: (1) proliferation, (2) matrix maturation, and (3) mineralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a BrdU-Hoechst flow cytometry assay, we found that the percent of proliferating cells was significantly reduced in cells derived from patients with SCS compared with those derived from controls (P &lt; or = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the matrix maturation stage, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity and the expression of extracellular matrix genes, collagen I alpha 2 (COL1A2), osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OC), and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>runt</z:mp>-related transcription factor RUNX2 were examined by enzymatic assay and real-time quantitative RT-PCR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified no significant differences in the expression of matrix related transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, we found significant reductions in ALP activity on days 3 and 7 and in RUNX2 expression on days 14 and 21 (P &lt; or = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantitative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40863">alizarin red S</z:chebi> mineralization assays showed a trend toward increased mineralization in osteoblasts derived from patients with SCS at days 21 and 28, although not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations of TWIST1 led to reduced proliferation regardless of the functional domain affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We did not find any conclusive differences in matrix maturation or mineralization in these primary osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is plausible that mutations in different functional domains of TWIST1 have divergent effects on these later stages of differentiation </plain></SENT>
