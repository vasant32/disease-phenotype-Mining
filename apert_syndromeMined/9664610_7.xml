<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a fibroblast growth factor receptors 2 (FGFR2) mutation, either C934G or C937G, was identified in exon IIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our report documents an affected mother and son in whom one of the two mutations in AS had occurred sporadically in the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosed of AS was based on associated abnormal physical features and on molecular genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A C-to-G transversion at position 937 of the cDNA resulting in a proline-to-arginine substitution at codon 259 was found in the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In her second pregnancy, prenatal diagnosis by both restriction analysis and direct sequencing was undertaken and this showed that the female fetus had not inherited the mutation </plain></SENT>
