<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, only small series of patients with Pfeiffer's syndrome who exhibit abnormalities have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective was to assess the incidence and pattern of radiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0003319'>cervical spine abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients with Pfeiffer's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cervical spine radiographs of 22 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Pfeiffer's syndrome treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital during the last 10 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the radiographs were reviewed by the craniofacial team along with a pediatric radiologist with experience in the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiological abnormalities included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the neural arches, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002937'>hemivertebrae</z:hpo>, and a "butterfly" vertebra as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>vertebral fusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>vertebral fusion</z:hpo> was present in 16 (73%) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fusion of both the vertebral bodies and the posterior elements were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>C2-C3 was the level most commonly involved, although fusion was noted at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels within the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Block fusions involving multiple vertebrae were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of sequential radiographs in 11 patients revealed evidence of progression in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results reveal an incidence of anomalies that is higher than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The older age of the patients in our study demonstrates the progressive nature of the cervical fusions in Pfeiffer's syndrome </plain></SENT>
