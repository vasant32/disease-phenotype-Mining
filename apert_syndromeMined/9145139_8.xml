<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is due to the grossly abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of both the skeletal and soft-tissue structures associated with a progressive disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper presents a clinical, radiologic, and histologic analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> hand <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and correlates it with the clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It also links hand and <z:mp ids='MP_0000428'>craniofacial dysplasia</z:mp> to other regions of the skeleton as well as the overall disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From our analysis, we conclude that there is a genetic anomaly causing variable and uncoordinated differentiation of the mesenchyme at the time of embryologic separation into its various skeletal components, particularly in the distal limb bud and craniofacial skeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This disease process continues postnatally in endochondral bone growth center malformation and malfunction as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0003869'>ectopic cartilage</z:mp> ossification in soft tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We discuss the role of abnormal musculotendinous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and altered biomechanical forces in relation to these processes </plain></SENT>
