<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Le Fort III osteotomy has been employed through coronal route on patients with midface <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then a REDII distraction device was set up, and the device bars directed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distraction begins 6.4 days after the surgery, with a rate of 1 mm per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When midface approaching the right position, i.e. an slightly over correction of occlusion is reached, the distraction stops and the device is held for the next 2-4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There are 8 cases completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the therapy with an average age of 11.9 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The midface had been moved averagely 9.7 mm forwards and 1.6 mm downwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The features had been improved obviously and the occlusions reach nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo> reduced from 20.3 mm to 11.9 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cephalometry, SNA was averagely enlarged 9 degrees, and ANB enlarged 8.8 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The snore during sleeping was also improved in 87.5% cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No serious complication had occurred except minor one such as 1 case of seroma and 1 case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> around pin on scalp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to 5 months averagely follow-up, there is no recurrence in our list </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Midface distraction osteotogenesis is propitious to teenage or severe cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
