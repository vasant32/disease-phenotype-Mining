<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main features were discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> but without associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> was seen in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No shunt procedures were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also studied the changes in the ventricular size after transcranial corrective procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in the ventricular size, the increase in the skull volume was compensated by expansion of the brain tissue and to some extent by increase in the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two cases with unusual features are also described </plain></SENT>
