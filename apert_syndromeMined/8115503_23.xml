<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience with eight infants or young children (less than 2 years of age) who presented sequentially with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a method of 14 measurements taken from the cranio-orbitozygomatic region in preoperative and postoperative CT scans of these patients, we documented their presenting skeletal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and the results of surgical correction at least 1 year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant preoperative findings included a wide anterior cranial vault at 110 percent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, a maximum cranial length that averaged only 90 percent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, a substantially widened anterior interorbital distance of 117 percent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, an increased lateral interorbital distance (112 percent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), and a widened bitemporal width at 122 percent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Globe protrusion was significant at 121 percent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and the medial orbital wall distance (length) was less than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 92 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the upper midface (zygomatic) region, both the distance between the zygomatic buttresses and the interarch distance were found to be increased at 109 percent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, while the zygomatic arch lengths were substantially shortened at 79 percent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of surgical correction, as documented by CT scan measurements, showed that more than a year after surgery, skeletal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> had changed from preoperative measurements but that none of the craniofacial measurements had significantly improved (p &lt; 0.05) in comparison with those of age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative measurement of CT scans of the cranio-orbitozygomatic region confirmed clinically observed findings in these patients before cranio-orbital reconstruction in infancy and early childhood and proved useful in assessing the surgical results over time </plain></SENT>
