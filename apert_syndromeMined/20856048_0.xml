<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distraction osteogenesis is associated with lower relapse rate and less complications compared with standard Le Fort III osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>General complications in using rigid external distraction include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized infection</z:e>, loosening of pins, and pin displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 24-year-old female patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> who underwent Le Fort III distraction osteogenesis is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard Le Fort III osteotomy was performed, and external distractor was placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 7-day latency period, the distractor was activated at the rate of 1 mm/d and finished after 20 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized infection</z:e> was recognized at the eighth week of consolidation period, and debridement was carried out at the left side of pin fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Obvious displacement of distractor occurred 1 week later while the patient was sleeping, and emergency operation was performed to remove the distractor and depress the left temporal skull bone fracture after clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was asymptomatic clinically, and the advancement of the midface was stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Le Fort I osteotomy was performed 3 years later to obtain a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> occlusion, and the patient was satisfied with the final outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that an unwanted trauma might cause severe complications such as skull bone fracture secondary to related local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and close follow-up and management are necessary for those cases </plain></SENT>
