<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only some 40 cases have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variable clinical signs have been described including prolonged retention of primary teeth and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the oral and dental findings in a family containing two affected brothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The family pedigree is informative, as the mother has had children by three partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two affected individuals are full brothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first affected brother has <z:hpo ids='HP_0000684'>delayed dental development</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> and small tooth crown size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mesio-distal and bucco-lingual dimensions were measured on the study models and compared with population data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The younger brother also has <z:hpo ids='HP_0000684'>delayed dental development</z:hpo> but only mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their half sister has severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> but no signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275078,C1305108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Carpenter Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This family study demonstrates two affected individuals with typical clinical features and a pedigree compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Small tooth crown size has been shown by standardized measurement and evidence advanced that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> is not part of the syndrome but a coincidental finding which segregates independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that the marked delay in emergence of teeth is associated more with problems of tooth eruption, possibly related to the bony abnormalities, than to a generalized delay in dental development </plain></SENT>
