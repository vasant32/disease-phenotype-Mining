<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Gradual midfacial advancement, applying the principle of distraction osteogenesis, reduces the restriction of the soft tissues and results in bony consolidation without need for grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The midface can be distracted by either pushing it forward, using semiburied devices, or pulling it forward by a rigid external device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each method there are inherent technical problems, such as controlling the vector of movement, symmetry of advancement, and differential movement of the upper/lower face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used a combination of the 2 methods, called "push-pull," in an effort to control the distraction process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to describe our push-pull distraction technique and summarize our early experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients (5 males and 5 females) with a mean age of 11 years 2 months underwent midfacial advancement using push-pull distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two orthodontists, blinded for landmark identification, traced preoperative and postoperative cephalograms and determined linear and angular measurements of midfacial position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Student t test was used to assess differences between the cephalometric measures on the 2 radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interexaminer reliability was calculated by an intraclass correlation coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postdistraction cephalograms were taken a mean of 10 months (range, 3 to 20 months) after removal of the devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients exhibited improvement at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels of the midface after distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant sagittal advancement from the infraorbital rim to dentoalveolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The central midface was sufficiently advanced as shown by an improved convexity, nasolabial angle, and upper labial protrusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between examiners for any of the measurements in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Push-pull distraction permits 1) equal movement at both the upper and lower facial levels, 2) advancement of the central midface, and 3) symmetric movement of the zygomaticomaxillary complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This method also provides a backup, in case one device malfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In combination, the advantages of each device are additive; whereas the weaknesses are not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The push-pull technique is a practical method for midfacial distraction until a better single device is fabricated </plain></SENT>
