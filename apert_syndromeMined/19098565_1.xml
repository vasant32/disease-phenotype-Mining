<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dry cornitis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo> can be seen often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When conventional fronto-orbital advancement is attempted in these cases, side walls of the orbit cannot go forward, because the width of bony orbit is smaller than the eyeball </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To expand bony orbits and cranial volume, supralateral rim of the orbit was expanded laterally at the time of operation and gradually advanced foward postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a coronal skin incision approach, frontal bone was taken off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Supralateral orbital rim bone was detached and cut at the centers of the orbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lateral expansion, 5 to 10 mm, was made and fixed with polylactate plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pair of distraction devices was fixed between the orbital rim and the temporal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frontal bone was let floating on the dura mater and tied loosely with the orbital rim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Advancement of 1 to 1.5 mm/d was carried out, and the devices were taken off after 1-month consolidation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients with Pfeiffer syndrome, 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, and 1 with Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome were treated with this method </plain></SENT>
