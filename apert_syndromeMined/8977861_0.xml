<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proband presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His mother and grandmother showed minor features of the syndrome including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes can include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000381'>stapes ankylosis</z:hpo>, a fixed ossicular chain in a too small epitympanum, and small or even absent mastoids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proband was treated with a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) instead of reconstructive middle ear surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Current literature on the results of ear surgery is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, reconstructive middle ear surgery should be considered if congenital anomalies of the middle ear are the only presenting symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases with additional anomalies such as atresia of the ear canal or damage due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0699744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear infections</z:e>, the outcome of reconstructive surgery to correct the anomalous ossicular chain is unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In such cases of the BAHA is probably the best solution </plain></SENT>
