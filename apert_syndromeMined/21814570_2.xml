<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The developmental pathways involved in horn development are complex and still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the description of a new dominant inherited syndrome in the bovine Charolais breed that we have named type 2 scurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination revealed that, despite a strong <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected individuals show both horn abnormalities similar to classical scurs phenotype and skull interfrontal suture <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on a genome-wide linkage analysis using Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip genotyping data from 57 half-sib and full-sib progeny, this locus was mapped to a 1.7 Mb interval on bovine chromosome 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within this region, the TWIST1 gene encoding a transcription factor was considered as a strong candidate gene since its haploinsufficiency is responsible for the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, characterized by skull coronal suture <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the TWIST1 gene identified a c.148_157dup (p.A56RfsX87) frame-shift mutation predicted to completely inactivate this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotyping 17 scurred and 20 horned <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founders</z:e> of our pedigree as well as 48 unrelated horned controls revealed a perfect association between this mutation and the type 2 scurs phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent genotyping of 32 individuals born from heterozygous parents showed that homozygous mutated progeny are completely absent, which is consistent with the <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> reported in Drosophila and mouse suffering from TWIST1 complete insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, data from previous studies on model species and a fine description of type 2 scurs symptoms allowed us to propose different mechanisms to explain the features of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this first report on the identification of a potential causal mutation affecting horn development in cattle offers a unique opportunity to better understand horn ontogenesis </plain></SENT>
