<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case clearly shows that expression of the disease can vary widely within a given family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One member affected as a fetus had a severe form suggesting Langer <z:hpo ids='HP_0008845'>mesomelic dwarfism</z:hpo> syndrome, whereas his mother was free of clinical symptoms and his maternal aunt had a typical form of Reinhardt-Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations in the other affected family members were perfectly consistent with dyschondrosteosis syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The very broad spectrum of clinical patterns in this family suggests that there may be connections between the various types of mesomelic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Establishing clear-cut distinctions between these entities, although useful in practice, may not accurately reflect molecular anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the family member affected as a fetus also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e>, which may have contributed to the severity of his condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possibility of identifying severe mesomelic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> antenatally by ultrasonography should be pointed out </plain></SENT>
