<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, the distractors for expansion are tooth-borne devices, i.e. hyrax appliances, which may have some serious disadvantages such as tooth tipping, cortical fenestration, skeletal relapse and loss of anchorage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, with bone-borne distractors most of the maxillary expansion is orthopedic and at a more mechanically desired level with less dental side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A new bone-borne palatal distractor has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By activation the nails of the abutments plates automatically stabilizes the device and no screw fixation is necessary anymore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This new distractor is presented and the data of five acquired deformity and eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital deformity</z:e> patients that were treated with this distractor are reported </plain></SENT>
