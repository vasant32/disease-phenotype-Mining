<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of this stiffness, the author has used split-thickness skin grafts when correcting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e> that contraction of such grafts post-operatively would not cause any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contracture</z:hpo> or finger deviation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Separation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> digits was accomplished before the age of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A dorsal rectangular flap and interposing triangular digital flaps were utilised to create the web space and partially cover the skin defects in the fingers </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At final follow-up (1-6 years), the areas covered by skin grafts have reduced in size significantly because of skin graft contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this did not result <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contracture</z:hpo> or digital deviation </plain></SENT>
