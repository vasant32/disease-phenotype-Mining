<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the study were to quantify presurgical growth, surgical results, and surgical stability as well as long-term postsurgical growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 31 patients operated on during their growth period (less than 10 years of age), 17 had sufficient records to be included in the study: at infancy, before the Le Fort III osteotomy (average age=7.3 years, range: 4.8-10 years), and immediately after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of the patients were followed radiographically long term for an average of 6.1+/-2.7 years (range: 4.5-10.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presurgical abnormal midfacial vertical growth pattern was accurately described with a progressive class III discrepancy and an increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remarkable postoperative stability of the maxillary segment was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After surgery, growth of the midface was measured, together with minimal, if any, anterior growth, similar to the presurgical growth pattern and rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No actual detrimental or beneficial effect of surgery on subsequent growth was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study quantitatively confirms that the standard Le Fort III osteotomy is a stable and effective but generally not definitive procedure in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study might also serve as a control sample to compare with groups of patients undergoing distraction osteogenesis to verify the actual advantages and shortcomings of this alternative technique </plain></SENT>
