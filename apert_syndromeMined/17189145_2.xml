<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study's goal was to determine ophthalmic phenotype/genotype correlations in patients with either mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review of demographic and ophthalmologic data was performed for 18 children carrying either the S252W (11) or the P253R (7) mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fisher exact tests were performed to determine significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotypes</z:hpo> between the two mutation groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the P253R group, 85% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> (14% required surgery), 71% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo>, 43% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo>, 14% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000579'>nasolacrimal duct obstruction</z:hpo>, 14% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo>, 14% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000540'>hyperopia</z:hpo>, and 14% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000483'>astigmatism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the S252W group, 91% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> (64% required surgery), 73% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo>, 73% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo>, 100% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000579'>nasolacrimal duct obstruction</z:hpo>, 36% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo>, 9% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000540'>hyperopia</z:hpo>, and 82% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000483'>astigmatism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, S252W and P253R groups showed significantly different numbers of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> requiring surgery (p = 0.039), superior rectus muscle underaction (p = 0.024), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000579'>nasolacrimal duct obstruction</z:hpo> (p = 0.0002), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000483'>astigmatism</z:hpo> (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients with the P253R mutation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> patients with the S252W mutation may have more severe ocular phenotypes with a higher likelihood of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo>, especially vertical deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They also are more likely to develop astigmatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">refractive errors</z:e> and tearing secondary to nasolacrimal system anomalies </plain></SENT>
