<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little data exist concerning the effect of midface advancement on mandibular growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective study of 38 patients from two craniofacial centers who had Le Fort III osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of this investigation were to document the size and shape of the mandible in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndromes</z:e> and to determine the effect on these parameters of downward and forward movement of the midface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The syndrome patients had increased gonial angle, increased MP-SN, increased ramus height, and increased ratio of ramus height to body length when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients operated during growth and those operated when growth was completed had similar mandibular size and shape indicating that Le Fort III osteotomy had no measurable effect on these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inclination of the mandible to the anterior cranial base was increased by the operation and remained unchanged during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that the size and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the mandible are similar in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of growth is more vertical in the syndrome patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Le Fort III osteotomy in growing children does not result in altered mandibular size and shape despite backward rotation of the mandible as a result of midface advancement </plain></SENT>
