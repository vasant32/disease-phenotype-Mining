<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the genetic alterations identified in TWIST, nonsense mutations, frameshifts secondary to small deletions or insertions, and large deletions implicate haploinsufficiency as the pathogenic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified three novel intragenic mutations and six deletions in our patients by using a new strategy to screen for TWIST mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with subsequent sequencing to identify point mutations and small insertions or deletions in the coding region, and real-time PCR-based gene dosage analysis to identify large deletions encompassing the gene, with confirmation by microsatellite and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The size of the deletions can also be analyzed by using the gene dosage assay with "PCR walking" across the critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 55 patients with features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, 11% were detected to have deletions by real-time gene dosage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a translocation or inversion at least 260 kb 3' of the gene, suggesting they had position-effect mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 37 patients with classic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, the overall detection rate for TWIST mutations was 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> in patients with deletions involving the TWIST gene is approximately 90% or eight times more common than in patients with intragenic mutations </plain></SENT>
