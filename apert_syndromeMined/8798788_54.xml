<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the consequences of these mutations on receptor function, we have made mutations in Xenopus FGFR1 (XFGFR1) and FGFR2 (XFGFR2) that correspond to several of the mutations identified in these dysmorphic syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of mutant receptor proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one have elevated tyrosine kinase activity relative to their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those mutations that give an unpaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residue</z:chebi> in the extracellular domain result in intermolecular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond formation and covalent receptor dimerization </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that different point mutations may activate FGFRs by distinct mechanisms and that ligand-independent FGFR activation may be a feature in common to many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
