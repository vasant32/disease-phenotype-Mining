<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of its rarity, limited insight into the anomalies associated with this syndrome exist and little long-term follow-up of affected patients is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of the clinical history, medical imaging, and therapeutic interventions for three full siblings with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275078,C1305108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Carpenter syndrome</z:e> over an 18-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The medical records were abstracted for kindred analysis, gestational and delivery history, health issues related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275078,C1305108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Carpenter syndrome</z:e>, and therapeutic interventions, including indications for, age at, and outcome of </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, acral deformities, and other associated anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, at birth, varied among the three siblings: one had fusion of the metopic and sagittal sutures and the other two had bilateral coronal, metopic, and anterior sagittal synostoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three siblings demonstrated marked absence or underdevelopment of the anterior cranial fossa and bulging of the middle cranial fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the degree of craniofacial dysmorphology and brain dysmorphology in any of the three individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic scan data of osseous and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and clinical photographs of treatment outcomes are provided to demonstrate the long-term craniofacial development and growth in treated individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275078,C1305108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Carpenter syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diverse anatomical variation seen in these three individuals supports the notion of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> within this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This spectrum of information should aid members of craniofacial teams in appreciating this variability and thereby facilitating the diagnosis and management of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275078,C1305108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Carpenter syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
