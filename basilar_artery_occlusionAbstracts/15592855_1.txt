Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is generally associated with a high mortality rate and a poor functional outcome in survivors. Recently, we encountered a patient with BAO, initially manifesting as vertigo and rebound nystagmus, subsequently followed by bilateral sudden deafness and dysarthria and terminating in a coma state within an interval of 6 h. A review of his history showed he had had two episodes of transient vertigo 2 weeks before the major stroke, and the neurological decline of BAO was heralded by the vertiginous symptoms. Restated, patients with BAO often have transient vertiginous attacks preceding fatal stroke. Therefore, those with vertigo and nystagmus may be signaling a forthcoming stroke event, something that should be considered for clinicians seeing vertiginous patients.
