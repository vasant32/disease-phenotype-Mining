The direct surgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms is not always possible, especially in posterior circulation aneurysms. This is usually because of their complex anatomy and location next to the skull base and brain stem, where proximal vascular control is usually not attainable. Four patients at our institution underwent intraoperative transfemoral catheterization of the basilar artery with a nondetectable endovascular balloon for proximal control of the basilar artery. The flow control in the basilar artery was excellent and facilitated the surgery. Before surgery, each patient underwent the placement of a 10-cm 8-French femoral introducer sheath and were taken to the operating room where they were placed in a supine position and a subtemporal or pterional craniotomy was performed. After the initial exposure and before aneurysm manipulation, a nondetachable silicone balloon catheter was passed through an introducer catheter and was placed into the rostral basilar artery, using flow direction, microguidewires, and angiographic "road-mapping" techniques. In two patients, temporary basilar occlusion was used to collapse the aneurysm and to facilitate clip placement. In the third patient, intraoperative aneurysm rupture occurred and was controlled by temporary basilar artery occlusion. Using intraoperative angiography, complete aneurysm obliteration and vessel patency was confirmed in all four patients. All patients made a complete recovery except for initial postoperative third nerve palsies in three patients. This technique achieves intraoperative control of the basilar artery proximal to an aneurysm by the use of a nondetachable occlusive balloon in the basilar artery. An added benefit is the ease with which intraoperative angiography can be obtained in this context.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
