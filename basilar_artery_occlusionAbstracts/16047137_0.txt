Despite the introduction of local thrombolytic therapy, there is still a very high mortality rate in basilar thrombosis. We report three cases of successful intra-arterial thrombolysis of acute basilar artery occlusion and consecutive interventional endovascular therapy. In all cases, the acute thrombosis of the basilar artery probably developed from preexisting atherosclerotic stenoses. The clinical outcomes were excellent. We discuss early consecutive stenting as a possible therapeutic option in cases of residual stenosis after successful intra-arterial lysis of basilar artery occlusion.
