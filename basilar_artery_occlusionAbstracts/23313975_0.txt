BACKGROUND:: A subset of basilar apex aneurysms is unsuitable for either primary microsurgical clipping or endovascular coiling. Treatment of these complex aneurysms can performed through terminal basilar artery occlusion, but only if collateral circulation is adequate. To circumvent these complications, a high flow VA-PCA or MCA-PCA bypass may be performed to create an adequate collateral circulation, to allow the treatment of the aneurysm by basilar artery occlusion and/or clipping. OBJECTIVE:: The operative nuances of this approach are discussed in the case of a 47-year-old man with progressive hemiparesis due to brainstem compression from a giant, unruptured basilar apex aneurysm with absent PCoA collaterals and incorporation of bilateral SCAs and PCAs within the aneurysm neck. METHODS:: The patient underwent a staged bypass from V3 to P2 coupled with terminal basilar artery occlusion. RESULTS:: The patient initially presented as mRS 2 with right hemiparesis. The aneurysm ruptured following the first stage of the operation, and underwent a V3 to P2 bypass the following day. His post-procedural neurologic decline improved at 14 months follow-up to mRS 2, with substantial reduction in aneurysm size observed at 9 months. The outcomes for three other bypass cases for basilar apex aneurysms are also summarized. CONCLUSION:: We discuss the indications, preoperative diagnostic work-up, operative management and post-operative outcomes in managing challenging basilar apex aneurysms. In our experience, high flow bypass procedures combined with or without Hunterian ligation in the treatment of these aneurysms are well tolerated with good long-term results.
