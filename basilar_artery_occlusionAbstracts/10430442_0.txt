A 49-year-old woman presenting with recurrent, reversible brainstem symptoms and a distal basilar artery aneurysm underwent balloon test occlusion. Five minutes after balloon inflation she developed a reversible isolated dysarthria. Despite failing the test occlusion (and after an additional brainstem event), the patient underwent surgery with placement of a clip across the basilar artery. The operation was tolerated without complication. The authors conclude that 1) pure dysarthria may be a symptom of temporary basilar artery occlusion and 2) balloon testing may overestimate the risk of basilar artery clipping.
