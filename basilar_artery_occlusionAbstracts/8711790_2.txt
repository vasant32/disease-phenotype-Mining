BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many patients with acute basilar artery occlusion may require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The circumstances and predictive value for outcome in these patients are not well documented. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 25 patients admitted into the intensive care unit with a clinical diagnosis of acute basilar artery occlusion and need for mechanical ventilation. The medical records were reviewed for clinical features, breathing patterns, mode of mechanical ventilation, ability to wean from the ventilator, and neurological outcome. RESULTS: Apneic episodes resulted in endotracheal intubation in 8 patients. In the remaining 17 patients, intubation was needed for airway protection. Seven of 8 patients presenting with apneic episodes lost all brain stem reflexes. All 17 patients intubated for airway protection could be successfully weaned to a T-tube circuit. Outcome was generally poor and 22 patients died, of whom 7 died of early systemic complications. Only 3 of 25 patients, all with locked-in syndrome, survived. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is high in patients who require mechanical ventilation after acute basilar artery occlusion. No neurological improvement beyond a locked-in syndrome occurred in survivors. Recurrent apnea appears to predict further progression to brain stem death.
