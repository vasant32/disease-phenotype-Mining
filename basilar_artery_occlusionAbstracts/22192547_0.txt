Mechanical clot disruption for the treatment of acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is known to provide a benefit. We aimed to determine the safety, recanalization rate and time-to-flow restoration of mechanical clot disruption and low dose urokinase (UK) infusions for the treatment of patients with acute BAO. Between June 2006 and June 2010, 21 patients with acute BAO underwent endovascular treatment that included angioplasty or stent placement. The time to treatment, duration of the procedure, dose of urokinase (UK), recanalization rates and symptomatic hemorrhages were analyzed. Clinical outcome measures were assessed at admission and at the time of discharge using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and at three months after treatment using the modified Rankin Score (mRS). On admission, the median NIHSS score was 13.2. Median time from symptom onset to arrival at hospital was 356 minutes, and median time from symptom onset to intraarterial thrombolysis (IAT) was 49 minutes. We used the following interventional treatment regimens: Intra-arterial (IA) UK and a minimal mechanical procedure (n=14), IA UK with angioplasty (n=1), IA UK with angioplasty and stent placement (n=3) and IA UK with HyperForm (n=3). The recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia grade II or III) rate was 90.5% (19/21). There was symptomatic hemorrhage in one patient (4.8%). The median NIHSS score at discharge was 6.3. The three-month outcome was favorable (mRS: 0-2) for 14 patients (66.7%) and poor (mRS: 3-6) for seven patients (33.3%). The overall mortality at three months was 14.3% (three patients died). Low-dose IAT with mechanical clot disruption is a safe and effective treatment for treatment for acute BAO.
