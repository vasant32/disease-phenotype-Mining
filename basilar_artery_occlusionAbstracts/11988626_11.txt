BACKGROUND: Acute vertebrobasilar occlusion remains a disease with a high mortality even after treatment by local intra-arterial fibrinolysis. Adjunctive treatment with platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors such as abciximab may facilitate recanalization and improve the neurological outcome. Results after treatment of 3 patients by combined intravenous abciximab and local intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) are reported. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Treatment was performed within 6 hours of stroke onset. Angiography revealed embolic occlusion of the basilar artery in 2 patients and atherothrombotic occlusion at the vertebrobasilar junction in 1 patient. Therapy consisted of intravenous abciximab bolus administration (0.25 mg/kg) followed by 12-hour infusion therapy (0.125 microg/kg per minute) and local intra-arterial thrombolysis with tPA (10 mg/h). Heparin was only applied for catheter flushing (500 IU/h). The patient with the atherothrombotic occlusion was treated with additional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting. Complete recanalization of the basilar artery occurred in 2 patients, whose conditions improved clinically to functional independence. In the third patient only partial recanalization was seen, with only slight clinical improvement. This patient died of cardiac failure 2 months later. Besides a subtle subarachnoid hemorrhage (n=1), no intracranial or extracranial bleeding complication was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor with local intra-arterial tPA might be a promising therapy for patients with acute vertebrobasilar occlusion. Further studies are necessary to define the clinical benefit and the bleeding rate of this new pharmacological approach.
