BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke is an uncommon sequela of Wegener's granulomatosis, resulting primarily from vasculitic infiltration of small to medium-sized vessels. We describe a young patient with Wegener's granulomatosis and basilar artery occlusion. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old man with histopathologically confirmed Wegener's granulomatosis suffered a brain stem stroke 24 hours after open lung biopsy. Angiography revealed midbasilar artery occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Wegener's granulomatosis may experience premature large cerebral vessel occlusion. Putative etiologies in our patient include vasculitis, postoperative hypercoagulability, and/or intraoperative neck positioning leading to embolization.
