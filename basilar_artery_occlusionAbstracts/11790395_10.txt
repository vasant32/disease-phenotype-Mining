Bilateral deafness is a rare but possible symptom for ischemia of the vertebrobasilar system, primarily derived from occlusion of anterior inferior cerebellar arteries or their branches. Patients 1 and 2 developed sudden bilateral deafness, soon followed by coma. The proximal segment of the basilar artery was occluded due to atherothrombosis in Patient 1 and arterial dissection in Patient 2. Thrombolytic therapy failed to recanalize the basilar arterial flow. Both patients died of extensive infarction in the vertebrobasilar arterial territory. Sudden bilateral deafness can be a warning sign of imminent brainstem ischemia by occlusion of the basilar artery regardless of age. Prompt and intensive management for stroke is needed for patients with sudden bilateral deafness.
