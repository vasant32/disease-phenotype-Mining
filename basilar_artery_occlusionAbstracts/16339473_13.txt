BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To report results of mechanical disruption or retrieval of thrombus as first-line treatment in patients with stroke attributable to occlusion of the basilar artery, in particular regarding efficiency and safety. METHODS: In 12 consecutive patients with acute stroke attributable to basilar occlusion, mechanical disruption or thrombus retrieval using various loop-shaped tools was tried before eventually starting local intra-arterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA). Main inclusion criteria were: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score >8 or Glasgow Coma Scale score <12; onset or worsening of symptoms <8 hours; no hemorrhages or large hypodensities on computed tomography scan; and occlusion of the basilar artery matching clinical symptoms. Efficiency included recanalization, procedure time, and r-tPA dose; safety was defined as rate of procedure-related complications. Outcome was evaluated at 3 months. RESULTS: Mechanical recanalization was successful in 6 patients. A single brain infarction, possibly attributable to distal embolization, occurred. Three patients had good outcomes. In 5 of 6 remaining patients, the artery was recanalized using r-tPA. A single asymptomatic hemorrhage occurred; 3 patients had good outcomes. Procedure time and r-tPA were significantly less in patients with successful mechanical thrombolysis (43.33 minutes and 13.33 mg versus 112.33 minutes and 55.83 mg, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical recanalization was effective in half of the patients and at least as safe as local intra-arterial thrombolysis. It allowed to save r-tPA and time. Although the low success rate remains a limit, the excellent and quick anatomical recanalization obtained after successful procedures makes this approach promising.
