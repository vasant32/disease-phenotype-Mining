Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) were recorded during surgery as a monitor of brainstem function in three patients undergoing posterior fossa surgery for clipping of basilar aneurysms. In two patients, ligation of the basilar artery, and of a vertebral artery, was associated with deterioration in BAEP and resulted in postoperative brainstem dysfunction. In the third patient, postoperative transient neurological dysfunction occurred following temporary occlusion of the basilar artery and this correlated with intra- and postoperative changes in BAEP. BAEP monitoring is recommended where temporary or permanent occlusion of the vertebrobasilar system is planned.
