Basilar artery thrombosis should be diagnosed immediately, as intra-arterial thrombolysis might improve the outcome. Diffusion-weighted (DWI)-MRI and three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography (3D TOF Turbo MRA) may provide additional insight into the extent of ischemia and the level of the occlusion. These methods could be helpful in the early classification of vertebrobasilar stroke, thus reserving the use of conventional angiography and possible intra-arterial thrombolysis for patients who had a severe clinical picture explained by preliminary assessments. We report the case of a 74-year-old woman who experienced a basilar artery occlusion; DWI-MRI and 3D TOF Turbo MRA provided noninvasive information concerning the level of arterial occlusion and its parenchymal ischemic impact, this leading to an intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy. These data suggest the feasibility of a noninvasive urgent diagnostic and prognostic approach with DWI-MRI and 3D TOF Turbo MRA in basilar occlusion.
