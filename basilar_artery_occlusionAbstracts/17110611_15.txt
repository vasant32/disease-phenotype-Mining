BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recanalization rates after the intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment have been poorly studied in acute stroke. METHODS: CT angiography was performed before IV rt-PA in all patients and digital subtraction angiography was undertaken for intra-arterial thrombolysis in cases of no improvement after rt-PA infusion. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were treated with IV rt-PA. Initial CT angiography showed relevant arterial occlusions in 35 patients. Recanalization after rt-PA therapy was demonstrated by digital subtraction angiography in 7 of the 31 patients with the occlusion on initial CT angiography: 2/16 in the internal carotid or proximal middle cerebral artery, 3/11 in the distal middle cerebral artery and 2/4 in the basilar artery occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: The early recanalization rate after IV rt-PA use was very low in cases with large proximal arterial occlusions. CT angiography before IV rt-PA may be useful for the prediction of its efficacy.
