We report on a 27-year-old female patient who developed a progressive neurological disorder (anisocoria, dysarthria and facial nerve paresis) after participating in a marathon race. She was admitted to a maximum care level hospital after endotracheal intubation with a provisional diagnosis of intracranial bleeding. Imaging studies (computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography) revealed basilar artery occlusion. A successful outcome was achieved following thrombolysis within two hours of the initial onset of symptoms.
