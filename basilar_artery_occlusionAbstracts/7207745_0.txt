The authors report a patient who sustained delayed occlusion of the basilar artery (BA) after an automobile accident. This report illustrates the clinical temporal profile of angiographically verified thromboembolic occlusion of the BA. Further propagation of thrombosis and/or late embolization in the proximal BA and distal vertebral artery resulted in fatal brain stem infarction.
