Summary: Basi-parallel anatomical scanning (BPAS)-MRI is a simple MRI technique that we designed to reveal the surface appearance of the vertebrobasilar artery within the cistern. Because it requires only 2 cm-thick heavily T2-weighted coronal imaging with gray-scale reversal, we can obtain BPAS-MRI with any MR machine of any company. BPAS-MRI can easily show the outer contour of the vertebrobasilar artery even if occluded. Therefore, BPAS-MRI can also reveal the occluded basilar trunk and the shape of basilar top branching that we cannot see with any other imaging modality before the recanalizing interventional procedure. To avoid a dangerous blind manipulation of guidewires or micro-catheters, BPAS-MRI should be obtained prior to the interventional procedure in cases of acute basilar artery occlusion.
