A case of basilar artery occlusion is reported. The patient suddenly developed dizziness and weakness of the right side. Computed tomography scanning showed focal low attenuation in the left quadrangular lobule of the pons. Cerebral angiography demonstrated proximal occlusion of the basilar artery and significant collateral flow in the posterior fossa from the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), which arose from the vertebral artery far below the foramen magnum. The literature concerning the origin of the PICA is reviewed.
