A 61-year-old male developed acute cerebellar swelling after thrombolytic therapy for basilar artery occlusion. He was treated with intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator 12 hours following symptomatic onset, and did well in the immediate post-treatment period but deteriorated the next day. Computed tomography demonstrated acute cerebellar edema and hydrocephalus. Suboccipital external decompression and ventricular drainage were performed. He survived and 1 year later he could perform daily activities at home. Computed tomography and angiography are essential to monitor the post-treatment course following thrombolysis of vertebrobasilar occlusive disease.
