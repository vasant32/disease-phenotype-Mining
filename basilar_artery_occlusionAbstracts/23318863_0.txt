We herein report the case of a 32-year-old woman with sudden onset ataxia, limb dysmetria and somnolence. Emergency radiological findings showed bilateral cerebellar and thalamic infarctions as a result of a basilar artery occlusion. The patient was treated with intra-arterial (IA) and mechanical thrombolysis 12 hours after symptom onset and showed an excellent recovery. A diagnostic workup revealed a tumor mass on the mitral valve that was surgically removed, while a histological analysis confirmed a diagnosis of cardiac papillary fibroelastoma.
