Acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a condition producing high rates of morbidity and mortality. Intravenous thrombolysis or intra-arterial thrombolysis are therapeutic options; however, the clinical outcomes remain poor. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate feasibility, safety, and efficacy of emergency stent placement following intra-arterial thrombolysis for patients with acute BAO. Thirty-six consecutive patients were treated for acute BAO using intra-arterial therapy from September 2004 to October 2009. Nine patients, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ranging from 8 to 12, underwent emergency stent placement following inadequate revascularization after thrombolysis. Neurological status prior to treatment was evaluated using the GCS score. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 90 days post-treatment were used to assess functional outcome and we reviewed clinical records for frequency of procedure-related complications. Stents were deployed at the target lesion in all patients. Successful revascularization was achieved in eight of nine (88.9%) patients (residual stenosis <50%). The median GCS score prior to thrombolysis was 9 (range: 6-12) and prior to stent placement was 10 (range: 8-12). Four patients (44.4%) achieved good outcomes as determined by the mRS scale (0-2 at 90 days). Mortality was 33.3% in all procedures with one patient (11.1%) experiencing acute intrastent thrombus formation. No patient developed symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Data from our small case series demonstrates that emergency stent placement following intra-arterial thrombolysis is a feasible treatment for patients with acute BAO and may reduce mortality and prevent re-occlusion of the basilar artery.
