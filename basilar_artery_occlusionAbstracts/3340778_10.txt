During a 20-month period, fractures of the clivus occurring after craniocerebral trauma were diagnosed with computed tomography (CT) in 11 patients. Five patients had longitudinally oriented fractures; these were fatal in four patients due to either vertebral-basilar artery occlusion, brain stem trauma, or both. Six other patients had transversely oriented fractures that extended through the carotid canal and petrous temporal bone. While less frequently contributing directly to mortality, transverse fractures were also associated with cerebrospinal fluid leaks (two patients) and a cavernous sinus-carotid fistula (one patient). They were not as frequently associated with Horner syndrome or cranial nerve deficits as suggested in the current literature. This retrospective evaluation reveals two distinct injury patterns that demonstrate a difference in related morbidity and mortality.
