This case concerns a stroke in the basilar artery territory that was successfully treated with a tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). A 44-year-old man suddenly lost consciousness. It took fifty minutes to arrive to our hospital after the onset. On admission, his consciousness was in a coma state. A head CT revealed normal findings but a cerebral angiography showed complete occlusion in the basilar artery. We gave 240,000 units t-PA intravenously for 60 minutes. The intravenous t-PA dramatically improved his state of consciousness. After treatment, the brain CT scan showed low-density areas in the left occipital area and right pons. The cerebral angiography showed arterial sclerosis in the basilar artery. There was no parenchymal hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction in the patient. The hitherto reports showed the intravenous infusion of t-PA may be particular value in patients with thromboembolic occlusion in the middle cerebral artery. In contrast, our results support its efficacy in strokes in the basilar artery territory.
