BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been approved for acute stroke therapy within 3 hours, the optimum management of basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is still a matter of debate. We compared intraarterial thrombolysis with the combined bridging approach of intravenous abciximab and intraarterial thrombolysis with rt-PA (bridging therapy) in an observational, longitudinal, monocenter study. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2006, information for 106 patients with acute BAO were prospectively entered into a local database. Patients eligible for treatment received either intraarterial thrombolysis with rt-PA alone (intraarterial thrombolysis) or were treated with intravenous abciximab and intraarterial rt-PA (bridging therapy). Outcome parameters were recanalization of the basilar artery according to Trial in Myocardial Infarction criteria, survival, and reduction of severe disability and death at 3 months. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors for recanalization, survival, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Of a total of 106 patients with confirmed BAO, 87 patients underwent subsequent angiography. Among those, 75 patients were identified who received the full treatment protocol. Patients in the bridging group had a better recanalization rate (83.7% vs 62.5%; P=0.03), a higher survival rate (58.1% vs 25%; P=0.01), and a better chance for an outcome with no or only mild to moderate disability (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3; 34.9% vs 12.5%; P=0.02). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rates were comparable in both groups (14% in the bridging group vs 18.8%; P=0.41). Independent predictors for recanalization were age (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99), atrial fibrillation (OR, 6.53; 95% CI, 1.14-37.49), and bridging therapy (OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.02 to 11.18). Independent prognostic factors for outcome were Glasgow coma scale score at presentation (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.03-1.45) and the combination of bridging therapy with successful recanalization (OR, 3.744; 95% CI, 1.04-13.43). CONCLUSIONS: Bridging therapy for acute BAO with intravenous abciximab and intraarterial rt-PA appears to be safe and yields higher recanalization and improved survival rates, as well as an overall improved chance for a better outcome.
