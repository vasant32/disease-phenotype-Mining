BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute basilar artery occlusion portends high risk of stroke and death. Thrombolysis or endovascular therapy has been limited to patients who present within hours of symptom onset. Without recanalization, acute basilar artery occlusion almost always results in death or severe disability. SUMMARY OF CASE: We report a case of basilar artery occlusion and successful endovascular recanalization 80 days after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular therapy can be feasible and safe for symptomatic basilar artery occlusion at chronic stage.
