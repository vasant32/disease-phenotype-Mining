A case is presented with distal basilar artery occlusion diagnosed by computed tomography (CT). The normal basilar artery imaged on plain CT scans has an attenuation value not higher than that of whole blood. If the CT attenuation value of the vessel is higher than that of blood, basilar artery occlusion is probably present. In the case presented the cause was traumatic thrombo-embolic occlusion of the basilar artery.
