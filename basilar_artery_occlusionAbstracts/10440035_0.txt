Patients with cerebrovascular disorders generally undergo computerized tomography (CT), even though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is available. We investigated the efficacy of three dimensional CT angiography (3D-CTA) for a first diagnosis of occlusive cerebrovascular disorders. Sixty-two patients, who were suspected of occlusive cerebrovascular disorder on the basis of neurological findings or initial plain CT findings, were reviewed. 3D-CTA was performed at the first medical examination. As a result, two patients were diagnosed with ICA (internal carotid artery) occlusion, nine with MCA (middle cerebral artery) occlusion, and one with BA (basilar artery) occlusion. All twelve patients underwent cerebral angiography immediately after those 3D-CTA in every case. Angiographical findings were the same as 3D-CTA. Interventional superselective thrombolytic therapy was performed in ten of the twelve patients, and recanalization resulted in four of them. 3D-CTA may also be able to determine whether the occlusive vessel is the chief cerebral artery or the perforating artery.
