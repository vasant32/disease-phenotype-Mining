Based on published case series, intra-arterial thrombolysis for basilar artery occlusion reduces mortality and improves outcome even when performed after considerable delays. In contrast, the current use of intravenous thrombolysis is limited to a 3-hour time window. The longer time window for intervention in patients with basilar artery occlusion may vary based on individual clinical features, such as collateral circulation and the site of the occlusion. Clinicopathologic evidence is presented from a patient with a distal basilar artery occlusion treated with local thrombolysis who later expired from a myocardial infarction complicated by cardiac tamponade. Autopsy showed infarction limited to the right pons despite symptom duration of over 72 hours and directly observed neurologic deficits for 27 hours.
