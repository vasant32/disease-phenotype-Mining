 PURPOSE: To study retrospectively the prognostic factors for acute basilar artery occlusion treated with intraarterial thrombolysis and stent placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within 3-48 hours of disease onset, 52 patients with basilar artery occlusion were treated with emergency intraarterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) or urokinase (UK) or intraarterial thrombolysis combined with stent placement. Sixteen patients simultaneously received stent placement for the partial recanalization of basilar artery occlusion after intraarterial thrombolysis. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of the patients were estimated. RESULTS: A favorable clinical outcome occurred in 22 patients (42.3%), and 20 patients (38.5%) died. The survival rate was 61.5% (32 patients). Successful recanalization of basilar artery occlusion was achieved in 24 patients (46.2%), and partial recanalization was achieved in 16 patients (30.7%). The rate of recanalization was 76.9%. NIHSS scores less than 14, treatment time window less than 24 hours, and a good recanalization were markedly correlated with good clinical prognosis. NIHSS scores less than 14 and treatment time window less than 24 hours were significantly correlated with recanalization. NIHSS scores less than 14 and good recanalization could act as independent predictors for clinical prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: NIHSS scores less than 14 on admission and successful recanalization can predict favorable outcome for patients with basilar artery occlusion. This study shows that intraarterial thrombolysis and stent placement may be a useful treatment for acute basilar artery occlusion.
