A 40-year-old man suffered chronic progressive symptoms of brainstem compression after undergoing endosaccular coil placement in a ruptured large basilar bifurcation aneurysm. Radiographical examinations showed coil compaction and regrowth of the aneurysmal mass with perifocal mesencephalic edema. The symptoms did not resolve even after additional clip occlusion of the upper basilar artery and the patient died of rerupture. At present, direct surgical clipping using a skull base technique with or without hypothermic circulatory arrest or upper basilar artery occlusion with or without bypass surgery may be a better choice as an initial treatment for giant or large basilar bifurcation aneurysm with a wide neck.
