Basilar occlusions treated with conventional therapy (anticoagulants or antiplatelets) have a poor outcome (80p. cent mortality). This unfavorable outcome may require a treatment within 6 hours by intra-arterial thrombolysis, sometimes followed by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in case of atherothrombotic occlusion due to a tight atherosclerotic stenosis. A 48 year-old patient, presented with left hemiparesis, left multimodal hypoesthesia, paralytic dysarthria. CT-scan showed a spontaneous hyperdensity of the basilar artery and arterial occclusion was confirmed by angiography, which showed an atherothrombotic occlusion involving the proximal part of the vessel. Intra-arterial thrombolysis began five hours after the onset with 0,25mg/kg of Rt-Pa (Actilyse((R))), given by bolus followed by 4 others bolus of 10mg. After a total dose of 60mg, arterial recanalization was obtained showing a tight atherosclerotic stenosis involving the proximal part of the basilar artery. PTA was performed 18 hours later with a ballon inflation at 6 atmospheres during 20 seconds. It allowed to decrease the stenosis from 80p. cent to 60p. cent. The patient recovered and MRI at D20 showed a small right lateral infarct involving the pons. Our study confirms the usefulness of intra-arterial thrombolysis in basilar artery occlusion. Consecutive PTA may be proposed in case of associated atherosclerotic stenosis, and the interest of PTA is further discussed.
