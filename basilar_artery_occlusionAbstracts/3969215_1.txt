Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were recorded in the acute and chronic phases of two patients with basilar artery occlusion. BAEPs in the acute phase showed disappearance of the waves before CT evidence of a definite low-density area in the brainstem. In one patient, the waves reappeared in the chronic phase, suggesting the importance of monitoring BAEPs in the acute phase.
