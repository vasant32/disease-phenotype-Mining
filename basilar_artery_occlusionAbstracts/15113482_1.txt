OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: To describe a novel therapeutic approach (endovascular basilar artery occlusion) to a notoriously difficult-to-manage clinical condition (actively symptomatic high-grade basilar artery stenosis) on the basis of assessment of the patient-specific mechanism of disease. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old woman presented with recurrent episodes of brainstem ischemia refractory to aggressive medical therapy. Cerebral angiography revealed a high-grade proximal basilar artery stenosis. On the basis of clinical presentation and angiographic findings, the pathogenesis of this complex of symptoms was thought to be embolic rather than hemodynamic. INTERVENTION: Endovascular coil occlusion of the basilar artery was used, with excellent outcome (cessation of ischemic symptoms and independent level of functioning at 1 yr). CONCLUSION: Successful endovascular management of intracranial occlusive disease requires understanding of the mechanism responsible for the patient's symptoms.
