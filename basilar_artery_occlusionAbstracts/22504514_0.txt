A male with atrial fibrillation for 30 years underwent embolectomy in his right leg at age 78 years. Postoperatively, he received enoxaparin 60 mg/twice a day (bid), and on day 5, phenprocoumon was started. The patient's son, a general practitioner, changed phenprocoumon to dabigatran 110 mg/bid on day 8. Pain in his left calf induced readmission after 5 days. International normalized ratio was 2.5 and D-dimer was 20 μg/mL. Dabigatran was stopped and dalteparin 5000 International Units/bid and 40 μg alprostadil infusions were started. After 8 hours, he became comatose due to basilar artery occlusion and eventually died. This tragic case raises the issue of postoperative use of dabigatran, a recently introduced thrombin inhibitor.
