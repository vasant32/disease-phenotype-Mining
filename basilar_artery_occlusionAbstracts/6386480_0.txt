We have investigated 6,380 patients with directional c-w Doppler sonography within the last 3 1/2 years, and have suspected obstruction of the basilar artery or of both distal vertebral arteries in 7 cases. Either bilateral sonographic silence or an absent diastolic flow component of the vertebral arteries were employed as criteria in the sonographic evaluation. Angiography of the vertebro-basilar system, performed in 6 cases, confirmed the diagnoses: basilar artery occlusion was found in 4 patients, 1 patient revealed tight stenosis of the basilar artery in its entire length, and 1 patient exhibited occlusion of both distal vertebral arteries. Three further basilar artery occlusions were detected by means of angiography despite initially negative Doppler sonography within the same period of time; 1 of those patients, however, met the above criteria for basilar artery occlusion upon sonographic reevaluation on the following day. Thus, we believe that directional c-w Doppler sonography is very useful in the diagnosis of basilar artery obstruction.
