Three consecutive patients with embolic basilar artery occlusion were treated with endovascular mechanical thrombus extraction. Recanalisation was rapidly obtained in one patient, who had a good initial recovery, and in another patient who made a complete recovery. By contrast, recanalisation failed in the third patient, who made no recovery. No haemorrhagic complications were detected. This technique may have advantages over thrombolysis in both efficacy and safety.
