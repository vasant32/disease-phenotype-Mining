Non-parenchymal neuro-Behçet disease generally affects cerebral venous sinuses, whereas intracranial intracerebral arterial involvement has been rarely reported. But co-involvement of both intracranial intracerebral artery and venous vascular systems in a patient at the same time has not been mentioned before. To the best of our knowledge, this case involving a 25-year-old male with a 7-year history of Behçet disease is the first reported of this type of involvement. He developed occlusion of the basilar artery together with thrombosis of the left sigmoid sinus, distal internal jugular vein, and straight sinus. He was successfully treated with a combination of high-dose steroid and cyclophosphamide. Cranial magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated the resolution of these abnormalities.
