In 28 patients with vertebro-basilar or basilar artery thrombosis brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) have been recorded. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded in 7 of these 28 patients. In 24 patients the diagnosis was angiographically proven and in 4 patients Doppler sonography and computerized tomography suggested this diagnosis. The BAEP and SEP findings were correlated to clinical and angiographical signs. BAEPs could be classified into 6 different patterns. In more than half of the patients different BAEP patterns from the two ears could be found. A pathological IV/V complex was most often found in comatose patients and in patients with a basilar artery occlusion distal to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Prolonged interpeak latency of I-III was mainly found in alert or drowsy patients with caudal occlusions. The frequent occurrence of a BAEP with only wave I preserved, or with no waves preserved, in patients with brain-stem functions suggests that BAEPs are not useful in the diagnosis of brain death when basilar artery thrombosis is suspected. SEPs were either absent bilaterally or else severely altered on one side in all comatose patients. In alert patients, including those with 'locked-in' syndrome, SEPs were never absent bilaterally. Increased N13-N20 interpeak latency was an uncommon finding in this series. There was no correlation between the SEP and the angiographically proven location of the occlusion. In the 'locked-in' syndrome both SEP and BAEP findings were non-uniform. Normal SEPs were sometimes found in combination with severely altered BAEPs, suggesting partial deafferentation. Since basilar artery thrombosis is now a treatable condition, early diagnosis and documentation of functional deficits moves into a more important clinical area than heretofore.
