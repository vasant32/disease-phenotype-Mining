Intraarterial thrombolytic therapy decreases mortality in the treatment of acute basilar artery occlusion. An acute decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) (<12 mL/100 g per minute) has been reported to invariably result in infarction. We report a case of acute basilar artery occlusion, recanalized within 90 minutes, with reversal of CBF of less than 6 mL/100 g per minute. After reperfusion, areas with persistent CBF of 6 mL/100 g per minute resulted in infarctions on subsequent CT studies. Parenchymal viability is possible after 90 minutes of posterior CBF of 6 mL/100 g per minute.
