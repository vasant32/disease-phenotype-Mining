 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multimodal recanalization therapy in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion provides high recanalization rates. A substantial subset of treated patients survives with only minor or moderate functional handicap. However, long-term functional outcome and quality of life in these patients have rarely been systematically analyzed. METHODS: In this monocentric retrospective study, we analyzed mortality, long-term functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale), and quality of life (36-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire) in all consecutive patients who had been treated for acute basilar artery occlusion in our institution between December 2002 and December 2009. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients (57 male; median age, 65 years; range, 20-89 years) were treated by multimodal recanalization therapy. This included intravenous thrombolysis (n=32) with consecutive on-demand intra-arterial therapy (n=23) or intra-arterial therapy alone (n=59). The overall recanalization rate was 89%. After a median observation time of 4.2 years (range, 0.5-7.4 years), the mortality rate was 59%. Among the 35 survivors, 26 patients (74%) had a good or moderate long-term functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤3). Health-related quality of life was better than that of unselected patients with stroke. Backward stepwise logistic regression identified intravenous thrombolysis (P=0.002) and female sex (P=0.001) as predictors of favorable functional long-term outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤3). Coma at admission (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8) was associated with poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≥4; P=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival is achieved in approximately 40% of patients with basilar artery occlusion treated with multimodal recanalization therapy. Approximately 75% of the survivors have a favorable functional long-term outcome with an acceptable quality of life.
