An 18-year-old adolescent girl died of an extensive pontine infarction. At postmortem examination she was found to have a thrombosis of the basilar and intracranial vertebral arteries with associated focal hyperplasia of the intima. Her ovaries were grossly small and inactive, with absent corpora lutea. Based on these findings, we suspect she was taking oral contraceptives. In cases of unexplained fatal strokes in young females, careful pathologic examination of the ovaries may provide etiological clues.
