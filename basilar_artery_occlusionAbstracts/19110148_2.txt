Stroke caused by acute occlusion of basilar artery (AOBA) produces high risk of death. In eligible patients, thrombolysis significantly reduces mortality and disability rate. In most hospitals, thrombolysis is limited to intravenous (IV) route of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, without any therapeutic alternative in cases of treatment failure. We report a case of cardioembolic AOBA, not responsive to a conventional regimen of IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. A sequential combination of IV tenecteplase (0.4 mg/kg) led to a complete recanalization of basilar artery, with a very good clinical outcome. The potential for a combination of two successive IV regimens should be evaluated in AOBA.
