OBJECTIVE: The authors report their experience in endovascular treatment of basilar artery (BA) trunk aneurysms by intra-aneurysmal and BA occlusion. METHODS: Four patients were referred to our hospital from 1995 until 2002 with variable clinical presentations and radiologic appearances. All the patients were subjected for tolerability to balloon BA occlusion test to verify the collateral supply from the posterior communicating arteries. The patients were treated by intra-aneurysmal embolization together with basilar artery occlusion. RESULTS: All the aneurysms were successfully isolated from the circulation. Transient postoperative neurologic deficits were constant findings in all the cases. Outcome was finally good for all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of complex BA trunk aneurysm by intra-aneurysmal embolization and BA occlusion method is a valuable alternative for management and successful isolation in patients with good collateral arterial flow.
