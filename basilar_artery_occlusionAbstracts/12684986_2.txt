The author describes a case of basilar artery occlusion caused by vertebral artery dissection with vertebral fracture. A 61-year-old man was admitted with neck pain after a traffic accident. His symptoms suddenly deteriorated and cerebral angiography revealed an occlusion of the right vertebral artery, and complete occlusion of the basilar artery. Local-arterial fibrinolysis with urokinase for basilar artery occlusion and angioplasty with the use of a self-expandable stent for the site of the vertebral artery dissection was performed, and the basilar artery was partially recanalized. The patient's symptoms gradually improved. It should be emphasized that in cases of acute cervical spine injury after major trauma, vertebral artery dissection should be considered. Local-arterial fibrinolysis and angioplasty using a self-expandable stent was regarded as a useful treatment for basilar artery occlusion caused by vertebral artery dissection, in the acute stage.
