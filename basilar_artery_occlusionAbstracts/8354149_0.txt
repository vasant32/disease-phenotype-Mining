A 32-year-old woman with migraine for several years again had a migraine attack with headache, nausea, vomiting and eye-muscle disorder, 14 days after an uncomplicated delivery. Within 24 hours a left-dominant hemiparesis developed, followed 12 hours later by tonic-clonic seizure and deep unconsciousness (Glasgow score: 3); the patient could not be aroused. Cranial computed tomography revealed extensive infarction of the brainstem and cerebellum. Angiography demonstrated occlusion of the basilar artery but not other abnormalities of other vessels. There was no evidence for vascular anomalies and the clotting tests were normal. Transoesophageal echocardiography demonstrated an atrial septal aneurysm. But any interatrial shunt (e.g. through a patent foramen ovale) was excluded by colour Doppler sonography, making it highly unlikely that a paradoxical embolus was the cause of the infarction. The brainstem infarction resulting from the basilar artery occlusion did not respond to treatment and the patient died 10 days after the initial seizure.
