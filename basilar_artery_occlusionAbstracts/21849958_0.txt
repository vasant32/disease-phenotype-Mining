It presents a case of a 39-year old woman with acute symptomatic occlusion of basilar artery proximal segment, which was manifested by severe neurological symptomatology and deficits. The patient was treated conventionally (anticoagulant, then antiplatelet agent therapy) with excellent short-term and long-term outcome. In spite of serious acute neurological symptomatology of basilar artery occlusion, proximal localization of the occlusion, fluctuating symptomatology flow, younger age and development of collateral circulation can suggest a good outcome in conventionally treated patients.
