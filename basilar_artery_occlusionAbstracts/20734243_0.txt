 BACKGROUND: Perfusion-computed tomography (CTP) is a relatively new technique that allows rapid semiquantitative noninvasive evaluation of cerebral perfusion aiding in the diagnosis of cerebral ischemia and infarction. There is a paucity of data on its application within the posterior circulation, especially, the brainstem. We describe a case of basilar artery thrombosis with cerebellar and brainstem CTP mismatch and discuss possible future applications of CTP for acute posterior fossa circulation and infarction. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: Successful use of CTP to aid in decision to proceed with neurointervention in acute basilar artery occlusion and confirm its resolution after mechanical clot retrieval. CONCLUSION: Perfusion-computed tomography can successfully be used to define cerebral ischemia and infarction within the posterior fossa and aid in decisions to proceed with neurointervention.
