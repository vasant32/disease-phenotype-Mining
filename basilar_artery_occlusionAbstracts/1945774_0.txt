Magnetic resonance (MR) images of 10 patients with pontine infarction were reviewed. A total of 17 examinations were performed on a 1.5 Tesla high-field scanner (GE) within two weeks after ictus. The infarcted area was detected by MR as early as 20 hours after stroke in one case. However, MR images obtained in two cases three and nine hours after onset were unremarkable. It is therefore suggested that follow-up study should be performed when initial MR images within 20 hours postictus are normal. T1-weighted images at four, nine and twelve days after ictus were interpreted as normal. In two of these three examinations, the infarcted areas were clearly demonstrated as hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images. In the other examination, however, an area of mildly increased signal intensity was seen on T2-weighted images. This case suggests that the fogging effect is also observed on MR imaging and that a small pontine infarction may be overlooked during the subacute stage. Basilar artery occlusion was detected as an absence-of-flow void in three of the ten patients. In conclusion, MR imaging proved to be a relatively useful diagnostic modality for evaluating acute and subacute pontine infarctions.
