Intraarterial urokinase infusion therapy with superselective catheterization was performed on 11 patients for acute occlusive cerebrovascular disease. The subjects were five men and six women with a mean age of 70 years (range, 48-83 years). Nine of 11 patients had middle cerebral artery occlusion and two had basilar artery occlusion. The interval from onset to infusion ranged from 3.5 to 9 hours, and the total dosage of urokinase from 24 x 10(4) to 150 x 10(4) IU. Recanalization of the occluded artery was achieved in nine patients (82%), and favorable clinical outcome was achieved in seven patients (64%). Six of whom were discharged with no neurologic deficits. Hemorrhagic infarction occurred in two patients without clinical deterioration. Our observations suggest that intraarterial urokinase infusion therapy with superselective catheterization may be very useful in the acute stage of occlusive cerebrovascular disease.
