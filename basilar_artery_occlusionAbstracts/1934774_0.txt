Nineteen patients (15 men, 4 women) with occlusion of the vertebrobasilar artery were studied in order to identify possible pathomechanism and to define the site of arterial occlusion and the topography of ischemic lesion of the cerebellum. Their mean age at onset was 66.7 years and the final clinicopathological diagnosis were thrombosis of the basilar artery (BA) in 15 patients and embolism in 4. The occlusion of the BA was contiguous to that of the vertebral artery in ten patients. Of these, the occlusion was localized to the caudal portion of the BA in two, to the middle portion in six, and extended to the rostral portion in two. In eight patients, the arterial occlusion was restricted to the BA. Occlusions of the middle portion were observed in four and that of rostral portion in two; in the other two patients, the whole BA was occluded. In one patient, there was no occlusion in the vertebro-basilar artery at the postmortem examination, but infarctions of the base of pons, bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and occipital lobes were confirmed, suggesting recanalization of the occluded BA. Cerebellar lesions were observed in all nineteen patients. Involvements of the area supplied by the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) were found in seventeen, while that of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) only in ten. Eight patients had cerebellar lesions supplied by both SCA and PICA. These facts suggest that cerebellar lesions are rather frequent and the SCA areas are more involved than those of the PICA in fatal patients with occlusion of the BA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
