Locked-in syndrome is characterized by upper motor neuron quadriplegia, paralysis of lower cranial nerves, bilateral horizontal gaze palsy and anarthria, with preserved consciousness. It is due to a ventral pontine lesion following a basilar artery occlusion. We report the first Indian case report of locked-in syndrome, a 10-year old girl in whom the syndome was preceded by a 'herald hemiparesis'. Although the exact etiology for the basilar artery occlusion could not be determined, treatment with low molecular weight heparin and warfarin was followed by partial recovery.
