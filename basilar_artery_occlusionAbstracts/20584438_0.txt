Summary: We demonstrate endovascular stent deployment for the treatment of atherosclerotic basilar artery occlusion with acute thrombosis. Application of a microstent without previous balloon dilatation resulted in vessel reopening and good clinical improvement. Emergency primary stent application can be technically feasible and improve the outcome in acute basilar artery occlusion and clinical status.
