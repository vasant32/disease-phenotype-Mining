BACKGROUND: The therapeutic efficacy of low-dose intravenous alteplase (0.6 mg/kg) for basilar artery occlusion (BAO) remains unknown. METHODS: BAO patients enrolled from the Japanese multicenter registry involving 600 stroke patients treated with the low-dose intravenous alteplase were studied. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients had BAO (8 women ranging from 32-92 years of age; mean baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score 16). The stroke subtype was cardioembolic in 15 patients and atherothrombotic in 4 patients. BAO was recanalized during hospitalization in 18 (78%) of 23 patients undergoing follow-up angiography. Within the initial 24 hours, 14 patients (56%) had a ≥8-point decrease in the NIHSS score, being more common than 267 patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCO) from the same registry (odds ratio [OR] 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-5.97) after adjustment by sex, age, and baseline NIHSS score. In addition, 4 patients (16%) had a ≥4-point increase in the score, being marginally more common than MCO patients (OR 3.13; 95% CI 0.81-10.25). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within the initial 36 hours (8% v 5%), independence at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale score ≤2, 48% v 52%), and mortality at 3 months (4% v 6%) were similar when comparing BAO and MCO patients. When compared with previous studies of BAO, vital and functional outcomes at 3 months were relatively better in our study. CONCLUSIONS: The use of low-dose alteplase resulted in similar outcomes when comparing acute BAO and MCO patients.
