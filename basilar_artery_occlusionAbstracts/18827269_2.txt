Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ischemic stroke in patients > 18 years of age who present within 3 hours of stroke onset and meet certain criteria. We report a case of a 16-year-old, previously healthy female who presented with a basilar artery occlusion and pontine ischemic stroke. She was treated with intravenous t-PA approximately 4 hours after the onset of symptoms. The patient demonstrated a remarkable recovery 6 hours after onset of her symptoms and had minimal deficits on discharge from the hospital 1 week later. She was found to have a lupus anticoagulant and was heterozygous for the prothrombin gene G2010A mutation. These were likely contributing causes for her stroke. She was also homozygous for plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) 4G/4G, which at present is a controversial stroke risk factor.
