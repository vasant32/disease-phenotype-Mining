The interventional management of stroke may consist of the use of angioplasty, stenting or mechanical thrombus removal technique. For this purpose several retrieval devices are being used. Recently the new alternative device - EkoSonicSV has been introduced, which is particularly suitable for recanalization of the occluded basilar artery (BA). Here we are presenting a complete recanalization of BA using this device in two patients with stroke over a short period of time together with the intra-arterial use of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and application of intravascular ultrasound.
