Basilar artery occlusion has a poor prognosis, but intra-arterial revascularization therapy has been shown to improve outcome. We report the case of a 32-year-old patient who suffered recurrent basilar artery occlusion and was successfully treated first with mechanical and pharmacological thrombolysis, then with stenting, in 2 separate angiographic sessions. An etiology of vascular dissection may account for the early postprocedural recurrence.
