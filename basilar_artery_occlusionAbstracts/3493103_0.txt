The role of SPECT imaging with N-isopropyl-p iodoamphetamine (I-123 IMP) in the detection of angiographically documented occlusive cerebrovascular diseases was evaluated in 24 patients, and the results of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were compared with x-ray CT. Twelve patients had internal carotid occlusion, ten had intracranial occlusion beyond the circle of Willis, one had common carotid occlusion, and one had basilar artery occlusion. SPECT images were obtained with a gamma camera, which was rotated 360 degrees around the patient's head 30 minutes after an intravenous injection of 3 mCi of I-123 IMP. CT images in the transverse plane were obtained, and the regions of reduced attenuation were identified for comparison of topographic extension of the lesion with the regions of decreased rCBF seen on SPECT. In six cases, the lesions seen on the SPECT images were distinctly more extensive than those seen on CT. In the remaining 18 cases, the extent of the lesion was identical on both CT and SPECT images. Radiochemical and radionuclide impurities, the distance of the detector from the head, and the nature of the collimator affected the SPECT results. I-123 IMP SPECT imaging complements CT findings in detecting the ischemic zones beyond the regions identified on CT images, and may have a major rule in the management of patients with occlusive cerebrovascular diseases.
