Nimodipine, isopropyl (2-methoxy-ethyl) 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate, is a new calcium antagonistic vasodilator with a preferential effect on brain vessels. Nimodipine prevents spasm of the isolated rabbit basilar artery produced both by depolarization and by receptor stimulation. In peripheral vessels nimodipine does not inhibit agonistically induced contractions. In vivo nimodipine also dilates predominantly cerebral vessels; peripheral vasodilation resulting in a decrease in blood pressure is much less pronounced. Nimodipine prevents the impaired reperfusion of the brain caused by a transitory global cerebral ischaemia. Nimodipine is predicted to be useful in the prophylaxis and treatment of cerebral vasospasm in humans.
