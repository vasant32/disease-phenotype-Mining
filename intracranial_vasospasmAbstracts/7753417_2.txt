Reduced glutathinone (tau-glutamylcysteinglycine, GSH) is a scavenger for oxygen radicals and plays in important role in protection of cells from ischemia and from the harmful effects of free oxygen radicals. Free oxygen radicals due to cerebral vasospasm increase in both vasospasm and proliferative vasculopathy. This experiment was performed to determine whether GSH plays a role in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage by preventing the harmful effects of free oxygen radicals. In this study, GSH was administered intraarterially and intracisternally following vasospasm of the canine basilar artery. Less vasospasm was observed in the group treated with GSH intraarterially following subarachnoid hemorrhage than in the one treated with GSH intracisternally and in the control group. The arterial wall was investigated ultrastructurally. We evaluated the effect of the anti-oxidating substance through the activity of superoxide dismutase in the arterial wall. We compared the effect of glutathione reductase in the two groups treated with GSH intraarterially and intracisternally. Arterial degeneration was more prominent in the group in which GSH was used intracisternally, while the superoxide dismutase levels were low. In contrast, arterial degeneration was less in the other group in which GSH was used intraarterially, while the superoxide dismutase levels were high.
