Cerebral vasospasm with subsequent infarction gives important influence to the prognosis of patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Many factors should be considered in the pathogenesis of cerebral infraction. Clinical and experimental studies of intravascular components with particular reference to platelet and coagulation factors were performed. Both studies revealed systemic platelet hyperactivity and a hypercoagulable state; in further experimental studies, crenated red blood cells were recognized in the course of cerebral vasospasm. These systemic changes of intravascular components are thought to accelerate cerebral ischemia through formation of microthrombosis, increased blood viscosity and reduced deformability of the red blood cells.
