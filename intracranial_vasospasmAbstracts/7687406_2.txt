Experimental SAH in the squirrel monkey induces an angiographically demonstrable late spasm of about 23% at six days post subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The late spasm is associated with a generalized reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) of about 30%. Intracisternal administration of the substance P (SP) antagonist spantide two hours and three days post SAH significantly reduces the degree of late spasm and also decreases the degree of CBF reduction. The findings suggest that SP is involved in the development of both angiographical spasm and CBF changes post SAH.
