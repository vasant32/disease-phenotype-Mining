Fibrinopeptide A (FPA) levels which have been shown to be a quantitative index of thrombin generation, were measured in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients following subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and from a control population. The levels found in samples obtained in patients following SAH are compared with those found in controls and also correlated with clinical grade on admission as assessed by the Glasgow Coma Score and the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons' grading system, and with the amount of subarachnoid blood seen on CT, the occurrence of ischaemic deterioration, the occurrence of low-density change on CT, the presence of vasospasm on angiography, clinical outcome as assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Score 3 months following the ictus, and the incidence of ischaemia as a cause of death or disability as assessed 3 months following the ictus. The levels of FPA found in blood and CSF from patients following SAH were significantly raised when compared with those found in controls. There was significant correlation between blood FPA levels and the amount of subarachnoid blood seen on initial CT. CSF FPA levels had a statistically significant correlation with outcome as assessed at 3 months post-ictus. No statistically significant correlation was found between blood or CSF FPA levels and any of the other variables studied.
