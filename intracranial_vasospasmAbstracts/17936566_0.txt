A subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is frequent after a severe head injury. Traumatic-SAH is associated with a bad outcome and may induce cerebral vasospasm. There is no agreement on the treatment based on the amount of traumatic-SAH. Non-aneurysmal SAH accounts for 15% of all causes of non-traumatic SAH. There is a risk of cerebral vasospasm, although less frequent than after aneurysmal rupture. The improvement in imaging techniques has decreased the frequency of idiopathic SAH.
