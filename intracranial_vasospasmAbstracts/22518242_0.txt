 BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasospasm is commonly seen in subarachnoid hemorrhage. However the vasospasm in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage without subarachnoid extension has not been described. REPORT: We report a patient who developed intracerebral hemorrhage associated with cerebral vasospasm demonstrated by conventional angiography. The vasospasm involved the superior and inferior divisions of the middle cerebral artery on the side of intracerebral hemorrhage. The vasospasm resolved in six days as documented by a repeat angiography. CONCLUSION: Cerebral vasospasm can be rarely seen in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Further elaboration is required to understand the pathophysiology and subsequent impact on outcome in such patients.
