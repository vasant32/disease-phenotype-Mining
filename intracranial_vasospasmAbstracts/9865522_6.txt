Since oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) is implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm, we have investigated the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in OxyHb-mediated signalling in canine cerebral arteries and cultured canine cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. OxyHb produced a contraction of basilar artery preparations, which was reversed by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, and PD098059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase. In cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells, OxyHb induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 42, 46, 54-60 and 80-100 kDa proteins with a time-course which paralleled the contractile action of OxyHb, suggesting that these events might be functionally linked. The 42 and 60 kDa proteins were immunologically related to the mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK2), and to p60c-Src (c-Src), respectively. The increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation was attenuated by genistein, and the phosphorylation of the 42 kDa protein (ERK2) was inhibited by PD098059. These results suggest that OxyHb-mediated signalling utilizes a protein tyrosine kinase-based mechanism.
