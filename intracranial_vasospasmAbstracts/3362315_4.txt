The safety, prevention, and treatment of chronic vasospasm by repeated administration of intrathecally applied nimodipine was evaluated in a primate model of chronic cerebral vasospasm. Twenty-four female cynomolgous monkeys were randomized into three groups of 8: sham, clot, and clot + intrathecal nimodipine. All animals underwent a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) induction operative procedure after base line angiography. Nimodipine was administered postoperatively by subcutaneous injection of 1 ml/0.2 mg tid for 6 days through an Ommaya reservoir with the catheter placed in the subarachnoid basal cisterns. Angiography was performed on Day 7 post-SAH induction. Intrathecally applied nimodipine was not effective in the prevention of angiographic vasospasm. It also did not seem to decrease the degree of pathological change when compared to controls. One animal in the nimodipine group died 2 hours after an intrathecal injection secondary to a respiratory arrest. Transient sedation and hypoventilation were common. No adverse pathological effects were noted. Intrathecal nimodipine did not produce a significant dilation of vessels in moderate or severe spasm when assessed by angiography 2 hours after intrathecal injection. Only 1 animal in 8 showed diffuse dilation of vasospastic cerebral vessels after an intrathecal nimodipine injection. Three other animals in this group developed dilation only of the basilar artery, which was in mild spasm.
