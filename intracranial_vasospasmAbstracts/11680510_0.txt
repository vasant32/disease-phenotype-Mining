No marker that predicts accurately the time of occurrence of cerebral vasospasm due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been reported. In the present study, membrane-bound tissue factor (mTF) and myelin basic protein (MBP) concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were evaluated as a predictor of the time of occurrence of cerebral vasospasm. The mTF and MBP concentrations were measured in the CSF from 28 patients with SAH due to ruptured aneurysm. Serial assays were performed from day 4 to day 14 after SAH. CSF mTF and MBP concentrations from days 5 to 9 correlated with the volume of cerebral infarction due to vasospasm and outcome three months after SAH. From the serial assays, CSF mTF measurements predicted the time of occurrence and severity and irreversibility of symptoms due to vasospasm. In conclusion, CSF mTF is predictive of the occurrence and the recovery of cerebral vasospasm, while CSF MBP is only an indicator of severity of brain damage due to vasospasm.
