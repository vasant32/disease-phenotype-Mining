The clinical effect of combination therapy with high doses of intravenous nicardipine and intra-arterial infusion of papaverine on symptomatic vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) was analysed retrospectively. In 66 of 122 patients who underwent early aneurysm surgery between 1990 and 1993, the intracranial haemodynamics were documented by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography. 33 of these 66 patients received high dose nicardipine intravenously (Group I); the other 33 patients were not treated with calcium antagonists (Group II). Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 6 Group I patients (18%) and in 13 (39%) in Group II patients. All 19 symptomatic patients received an intra-arterial infusion of papaverine; 15 patients (79%) responded well to this therapy and the symptoms were reversed quickly. Although the mean flow velocity (MFV) was not different between the two groups, it was reduced significantly after papverine infusion. Our retrospective analysis suggests that symptomatic vasospasm can be treated effectively with the combination of intravenous high dose nicardipine and intra-arterial infusion of papaverine, and that the correct timing of the infusions is crucial.
