OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of endovascular embolization of intracranial aneurysms with detachable coil and detachable balloon and emphasize the mainpoint of embolic technique. METHODS: 194 patients underwent complete cerebral angiography using microcatheter under DSA imaging. 80 cases with 90 aneurysms were emboliced by MDS, 69 cases with 71 aneurysms were emboliced by GDC. 37 of 40 giant aneurysms were emboliced by detachable balloon, 2 aneurysms by GDC, 1 by MDS. RESULTS: 194 patients with 201 aneurysms were cured successfully; 191 cases recovered clinically, 3 patients died. 187 aneurysms achieved 100% embolization, 8 with 95% embolization, 4 with 90% embolization, and 1 with 80% embolization. Four aneurysms reputured during the embolization, 4 patients had cerebral infarction, one patient died by hard-treated cerebral vasospasm which was affected by microcoil escape. Two recurrent cases were cured by second GDC embolization. CONCLUSIONS: The method of endovascular embolization to treat intracranial aneurysm is safe, reliable and effective. Those cases with giant aneurysms will have high recurrence in the future. Patients who suffer from SAH repeatedly may have great possibility of aneurysm rupture during embolization.
