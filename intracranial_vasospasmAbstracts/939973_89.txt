Elevation of systemic arterial pressure in seven patients with intracranial arterial aneurysms has been shown to be effective in alleviating ischemic symptoms attributed to cerebral vasospasm. Autoregulation is at least partially lost in patients with cerebral hemodynamic crisis. Blood volume expansion was used to augment vasopressors in maintenance of systemic hypertension. The management of these cases is discussed. Caution in the use of this technique is advised, since the regimen is not without risk.
