The purpose of this study was to investigate the influences of scald on endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression in cerebral vessels of rats, and to further elucidate the relationship between changes of ET-1 expression and scald-induced cerebral vascular remodelling resulting in cerebral vasospasm. The ET-1 levels in the cerebral basilar arteries were estimated by radioimmunoassay. Expression of ET-1 and its mRNA were determined by Western blotting and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. Changes of cerebral basilar artery histology were observed and diameters were measured by angiography. The results showed that the ET-1 levels at 3h after scald were enhanced, peaking at 12h; the expression of ET-1 mRNA was also enhanced, peaking at 6h. Simultaneous vascular remodelling was observed in the cerebral basilar arteries, vasoconstriction peaking at 12h. It is suggested that ET-1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of scald-induced cerebral vasospasm and cerebral circulation disorder.
