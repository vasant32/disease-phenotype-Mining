Aim of the study was to quantify cerebral vasospasm in rats after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) by morphometric examination of basilar artery and to evaluate the influence of endothelin receptor blocker BQ-123 on basilar artery constriction. The rat cisterna magna (CM) was cannulated and after 7 days SAH was developed by administration of 100 microl autologic, non-heparinized blood to the CM. The sham subarachnoid hemorrhage was developed by intracisternal administration of 100 microl of artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Endothelin receptor blocker BQ-123 was injected into the CM in a dose of 40 nmol diluted in 50 microl of cerebrospinal fluid 20 min. before SAH, and 24h and 48 h after SAH. After perfusion fixation the brains were removed from the skull and histological preparations of basilar artery were done. The internal diameter and wall thickness of basilar arteries was measured by interactive morphometric method. The most severe vasospasm was found in rats after SAH. The presence of numerous infiltrations composed of neutrophils and macrophages correlated with advanced vasospasm (index of constriction 5 times lower than in normal), suggesting the role of other factors participating in the late phase of vasospasms after SAH. Administration of BQ-123 in the late phase after SAH caused the dilatation of basilar artery. Following the administration of BQ-123 in the late phase (48 h after SAH) the basilar artery dilated, its wall became thinner, and the number of leukocyte infiltrations in the subarachnoid space decreased compared to the values after SAH alone.
