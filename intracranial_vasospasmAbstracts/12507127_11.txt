OBJECT: Cerebral vasospasm remains a devastating medical complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Reactive oxygen species and subsequent lipid peroxidation are reported to participate in the causes of cerebral vasospasm. This clinical study was performed to investigate the relationships between levels of lipid peroxides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and both delayed cerebral vasospasm and clinical outcome after SAH. METHODS: Levels of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH) and cholesteryl ester hydroperoxide (CEOOH) in the CSF were measured in 20 patients with aneurysmal SAH. The patients' CSF was collected within 48 hours of hemorrhage onset and on Day 6 or 7 post-SAH. On Day 7, angiography was performed to verify the degree and extent of the vasospasm. The relationship between the patients' clinical profiles and the levels of lipid peroxides in the CSF were investigated. Both PCOOH and CEOOH were detectable in CSF, and their levels decreased within 7 days after onset of SAH. The levels of CEOOH within 48 hours after onset of hemorrhage were significantly higher in patients in whom symptomatic vasospasm later developed than in patients in whom symptomatic vasospasm did not develop (p = 0.002). Levels of PCOOH measured within 48 hours after onset of hemorrhage were significantly higher in patients with poor outcomes than in patients with good outcomes (p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of lipid peroxides measured in the CSF during the acute stage of SAH were predictive of both symptomatic vasospasm and poor outcome. Measurements of lipid peroxides in the CSF may be useful prognostically for patient outcomes as well as for predicting symptomatic vasospasm.
