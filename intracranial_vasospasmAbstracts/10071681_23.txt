In this pilot study we treated cerebral vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage to assess intra-arterial fasudil hydrochloride. We analysed effects of intra-arterial infusion on angiographically evident cerebral vasospasm in 10 patients including 3 with symptoms of vasospasm. Over 10 to 30 min 15 to 60 mg was administered via the proximal internal carotid artery or vertebral artery following standard angiography, without superselective techniques. A total of 24 arterial territories (21 internal carotid, 3 vertebral) were treated. Angiographic improvement of vasospasm was demonstrated in 16 arterial territories (local dilation in 2, diffuse dilation in 14) in 9 patients. In 2 symptomatic patients, intra-arterial fasudil hydrochloride was associated with resolution of symptoms without sequelae. In the third symptomatic patient the benefit of fasudil hydrochloride was only temporary, and a large cerebral infarction occurred. All asymptomatic patients showed no progression of angiographic to symptomatic vasospasm after treatment with intra-arterial fasudil hydrochloride. No adverse effect was encountered.
