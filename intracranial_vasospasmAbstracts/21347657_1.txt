Using vascular heat-exchange controller implemented mild hypothermia treatment, the authors established the cerebral vasospasm model in which blood was injected twice into dog's foramen magnum; and it was discussed the influence of the concentration of endothelin-1 and NO in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid through continuing treatment of mild hypothermia at different times in secondary brain vasospasm model after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Thirty healthy mongrel dogs were randomly divided into five groups; artificial cerebrospinal fluid group (group A), normal temperature control group (group C), mild hypothermia 8 h group (group H1), mild hypothermia 16 h group (group H2), and mild hypothermia 32 h group (group H3). The authors injected the artificial CSF into dog's foramen magnum in group A while the other four groups were injected with autologous arterial blood. The normal group's temperature maintained 38.5°C. The authors set the temperature at 33.5°C in mild hypothermia groups and this was maintained for 8, 16, and 32 h, respectively. ET-1 and NO levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma were assayed in each group on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Then the changes of the diameter of blood vessels of cerebral basilar artery and overall performance categories score in each group through application of CT angiography were recorded. In the cerebral vasospasm model which was constructed by injecting the blood to dog twice, mild hypothermia treatment, through the application of vascular heat-exchange controller, could reduce cerebral vasospasm. It was observed that the duration of the mild hypothermia is directly proportional to the longer duration of the relieving of cerebral vasospasm. The reciprocal changes observed in the levels of ET-1 and NO in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma revealed that it might be possible to reduce the cerebral vasospasm by regulating the rising amplitude of ET-1 and the decrease in NO in CSF and plasma.
