BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypervolemic hemodilution therapy is effective for treating neurological deficits due to cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We monitored various hemorheological and hemodynamic parameters to assess the effects of hypervolemic hemodilution therapy in SAH patients with cerebral vasospasm. METHODS: Ninety-eight patients who underwent early craniotomy for aneurysm clipping surgery after SAH were studied. Fifty-one patients (52.0%) developed symptomatic vasospasm. The hematocrit level and red blood cell aggregability were measured daily from day 1 to day 14, whereas the circulating blood volume and cerebral blood flow were measured periodically. Cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were also measured using a Swan-Ganz catheter. RESULTS: The hematocrit level was decreased significantly to 29% to 32% by hypervolemic hemodilution therapy. Red blood cell aggregability increased until day 6 but was significantly reduced by therapy. Hypovolemia tended to develop after SAH. However, patients receiving hypervolemic hemodilution therapy became normovolemic to hypervolemic, with a significant increase of cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. At the onset of vasospasm, cerebral blood flow was significantly lower on the operated side than on the contralateral side, and it increased on both sides with therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SAH develop hypovolemia, hemodynamic depression, and increased red blood cell aggregability. Hypervolemic hemodilution therapy decreases hematocrit level and red cell aggregability while increasing cardiac output. Improvement of hemorheological and hemodynamic parameters by this therapy can reverse neurological deterioration due to cerebral vasospasm.
