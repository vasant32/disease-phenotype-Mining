The management of vasospasm associated with traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage presents many challenges. We present a 20-year-old male admitted after sustaining a closed head injury complicated by a Fisher grade III traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. Despite treatment with intravenous nimodipine he developed a delayed ischaemic neurological deficit due to cerebral arterial vasospasm. The vasospasm was successfully managed with serial papaverine angioplasty.
