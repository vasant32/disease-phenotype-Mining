In a new treatment regimen with antifibrinolytic drugs in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhages, we have systematically controlled the level of fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The frequency of severe vasospasm with clinical ischaemia has been compared with the patient's initial level of FDP. Fifty patients have been included in this study. (All in Hunt and Hess's grades I or II on their arrival.) Patients with a secondary deterioration unrelated to vasospasm were excluded. The FDP levels were measured in the first three days following the bleeding and we were informed of them at the end of the study. The diagnosis of severe vasospasm was confirmed by arteriography and computed tomography (CT) and it was named "severe" when accompanied with signs of clinical ischaemia. Twenty patients developed a severe vasospasm with clinical ischaemia. In these patients, the mean value of the initial FDP level was between 80 and 320 mcg/ml compared with 20 to 80 mcg/ml for those who had not developed clinical ischaemia (p = 0.0009). Furthermore, two different groups may be discriminated by their initial FDP level: FDP greater than 80 mcg/ml; n = 23, 65% severe vasospasm; FDP less than 80 mcg/ml; n = 27.8% no severe vasospasm (p less than 0.001). These results do not imply a direct role of FDP in pathophysiological mechanisms of vasospasm, but they suggest a relationship between the clot lysis and the appearance of vasospasm with clinical ischaemia. To our knowledge this is the first time that such a predictive role can be attributed to the initial FDP level in the prognosis of vasospasm.
