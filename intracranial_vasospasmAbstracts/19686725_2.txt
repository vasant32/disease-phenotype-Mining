Cerebral vasospasm remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an oxidative stress-inducible enzyme with multiple protective functions against vascular and neurological diseases, including delayed cerebral vasospasm. In the present study, intravenous administration (i.v.) of nicaraven (1 mg/kg/min, for 2 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage) ameliorated delayed cerebral vasospasm in rat subarachnoid hemorrhage models, marked synergistic induction of HO-1 protein (> 2.5-fold than 'subarachnoid hemorrhage with saline i.v.'), and elicited a rapid increase of cGMP accumulation in the basilar arteries. In the sham-operated rats, nicaraven could not induce HO-1 expression. Antisense HO-1 oligodeoxynucleotides abrogated this HO-1 induction and the antivasospastic effect of nicaraven. In vitro study using Hela cells, nicaraven enhanced the human HO-1 promoter (-4.5 kbp) activity, which was pre-activated with the blood component oxyhemoglobin to mimic the ability of subarachnoid hemorrhage. These results suggest that this enhanced HO-1 expression through a combination of pathological state and pharmacological agent could be an effective strategy to improve the prognosis of heme- and oxidative stress-induced diseases, such as delayed cerebral vasospasm.
