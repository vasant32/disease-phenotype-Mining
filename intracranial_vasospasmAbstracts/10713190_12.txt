BACKGROUND: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) was originally identified as a potent vasoconstrictor peptide. Numerous reports have suggested its roles in various disorders. Although there is a great deal of evidence establishing the relationship between ET-1 and cerebral vasospasm in animals, this relationship still remains to be clarified in humans. METHODS: The concentration of ET-1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured by radioimmunoassay in 23 subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. CSF samples were collected every 10 days after surgery from the cisternal drainage tube. RESULTS: Initial concentrations of ET-1 in the CSF collected the first day after operation were all increased compared with the control CSF. In seven of the eight vasospasm patients, the concentrations of ET-1 had increased before the observation of vasospasm and then decreased before the disappearance of the vasospasm. In 13 out of the 15 patients without vasospasm, the concentrations of ET-1 in CSF decreased with time. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that the concentration of ET-1 in CSF increased before the onset of cerebral vasospasm caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage. The ET-1 concentration in the CSF could be a useful marker to detect cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
