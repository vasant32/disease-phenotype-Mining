We studied human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) types in a group of 45 patients who had aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A significantly increased frequency of HLA antigen A31 and a significantly decreased frequency of HLA antigen B40 were found. In patients with delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) following aneurysmal SAH and HLA typing, HLA-Bw60 antigen showed significant increases; in patients who did not develop HLA-Aw33 and -Cw4 antigens showed significant. Among the patients with Fisher's Group 3 on CT, in particular, these antigens significantly increased when compared with controls from the same geographic area. These results suggest that HLA-Bw60 antigen plays a role as predisposing factor of DIND resulting from vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH, and that HLA-Aw33 and -Cw4 exert protective influence against DIND.
