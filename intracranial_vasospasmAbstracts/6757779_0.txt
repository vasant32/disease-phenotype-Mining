Prostacyclin(PGI2), a strong vasodilator of cerebral vessels and a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, was infused intravenously in 7 cats after induction of prolonged vasospasm by hourly application of oxyhemoglobin solution into the subarachnoid space around the basilar artery. PGI2, at a concentration of 50 ng/kg/min, was effective in releasing the vasospasm in the 7 cats. On the other hand, PGI2 did not produce significant hypotension. This report will discuss our results and the probable mechanism of action of PGI2 in cerebral vasospasm.
