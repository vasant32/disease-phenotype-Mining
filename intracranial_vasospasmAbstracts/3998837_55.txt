A leukotriene-like immunoreactivity was measured by radioimmunoassay in the gerbil forebrain following ischemia and reperfusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or nonlethal concussive brain injury. In each paradigm an increase in immunoreactivity levels was found. Peak levels were reached 15 to 30 minutes after each insult, and slowly returned to baseline over the next 24 hours. The study supports the suggestion that cerebral vessels and circulating blood are capable of producing leukotrienes, and that a major source of production is a nonvascular component within gray matter, possibly the cortical neuron. Leukotrienes may play a role in the pathophysiology of cerebral edema formation, cerebral vasospasm, seizure activity, and other central nervous system abnormalities. These studies are the first to demonstrate leukotriene production in gerbil brain following SAH or concussive brain injury.
