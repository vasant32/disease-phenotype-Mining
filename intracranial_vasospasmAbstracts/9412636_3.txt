BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage results in proliferative vasculopathy. Systemic hypertension also causes vascular hypertrophy. Both of these histological changes can lead to rigidity of the cerebrovascular system, reducing its autoregulatory capacity. METHODS: Blood flow velocity (BFV) in the middle cerebral artery at rest and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVRC) (percent rise in BFV after acetazolamide stimulation) measured by means of transcranial Doppler sonography were studied many years after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with proven cerebral vasospasm (mean BFV > 160 cm/s). The BFV under resting conditions and the CVRC values of the ipsilateral and the contralateral hemispheres were measured in 29 patients (mean age, 43 years; mean follow-up, 4.6 years) and compared with those of control subjects. RESULTS: Persistent high BFV (> 120 cm/s) was found in three patients in the peripheral branch of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery. In the main trunks of the arteries of the anterior circle of Willis, BFV was normal in all cases. CVRC was normal in all patients (ipsilateral, 52 +/- 21%; contralateral, 56 +/- 17%); values did not differ significantly from each other or from the control value (45 +/- 18%). The higher value of CVRC on the contralateral side was found to be statistically significant in selected groups (hypertensive patients and patients with residual infarct on late CT). CONCLUSIONS: Proliferative vasculopathy developed at the time of vasospasm must have resolved and did not reduce late vasoreactivity. Comorbidity with hypertension also did not seem to influence the late vasoreactivity toward normalization.
