Vasospasm was produced in adult mongrel dogs by a two-hemorrhage method, and the spastic basilar arteries were exposed via the transclival route on Day 7. Tonic contraction was produced in the normal canine basilar arteries by a local application of KCl or serotonin after transclival exposure. The exposed spastic and tonic basilar arteries then received a topical application of the following: 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine (H-7), a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C acting at the catalytic domain; calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C acting at the regulatory domain; or calpeptin, a selective inhibitor of calpain. Both spastic and tonic basilar arteries were effectively dilated by H-7. Calphostin C caused only slight dilation of spastic basilar arteries but moderate dilation of tonic basilar arteries. Dilation in response to calpeptin was remarkable in the spastic basilar arteries but slight in the tonic basilar arteries. The doses of calphostin C and calpeptin required to obtain maximum effect were markedly lower in the tonic model than in the spastic model. The spastic and tonic models had a similar dose-dependent response to H-7 but quite a different response to calphostin C or calpeptin, suggesting a difference in the function of protein kinase C and calpain in the two models. Furthermore, the effect of calphostin C on the reversal of vasospasm was increased significantly after topical treatment with calpeptin. It is suggested that the majority of the catalytic domain of protein kinase C is dissociated from the regulatory domain, probably by a limited proteolysis with calpain, and is markedly activated in vasospasm.
