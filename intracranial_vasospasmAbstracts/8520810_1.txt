Late cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a disastrous phenomenon for the patients and a definite treatment has not been established. We studied 48 consecutive patients receiving high-dose diltiazem (5 micrograms/kg/min) injection combined with dextran and hydrocortisone to late cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). All but 2 patients underwent surgery within 72 hours after SAH. Diltiazem was continuously given via a central venous line for up to 2 weeks in conjunction with simple cisternal drainage. 5% of dextran solution (500 ml/day) was infused for 7-10 days. Hydrocortisone was given 1,600 mg on the first day, then the dose was gradually decreased over 14 days. Symptomatic vasospasm (SVS) occurred in 5 patients (10.4%), 4 patients recovered, but 1 had severe neurological deficit. A low density area on CT-scan was observed in 2 patients. Thirty patients (62.5%) had good recovery, 10 patients (20.8%) had moderate disability, 3 (6.3%) had severe disability and 3 (6.3%) had vegetative survival. Two patients died of the initial brain damage. There were no severely hypotensive side effects. However, 3 patients showed atrioventricular blockage on electrocardiogram. These side effects subsided after the dose of the drug was decreased or administration was stopped altogether. These findings show that high-dose calcium antagonist diltiazem therapy combined with dextran and hydrocortisone injection is safe and effective for prevention of late cerebral symptomatic vasospasm after SAH.
