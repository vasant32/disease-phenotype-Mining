Nimodipine, now widely used for treatment and prevention of cerebrovascular spasm, is regarded as a safe drug. Despite a preferential action on cerebral vessels, there is clinical and experimental evidence of effects on systemic vascular and intestinal smooth muscle cells. Gastro-intestinal side-effects, however, have not been reported in clinical studies dealing with treatment of vasospasm following subarachnoid haemorrhage. We report on a patient with subarachnoid haemorrhage who developed an acute life-threatening pseudo-obstruction of the colon, a variant of adynamic ileus, while being treated with intravenous nimodipine. The relationship between this complication and calcium antagonist therapy is discussed and therapeutic strategies are presented. We conclude that neurosurgeons and neurologists should be aware of calcium antagonist--related ileus in patients treated with nimodipine.
