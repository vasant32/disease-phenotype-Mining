Experiments were performed to assess the ability of bencianol (ZY15051) to reverse contractions of human basilar arteries in vitro that were induced by a wide range of substances implicated in the aetiology of migraine and cerebral arterial spasm. Bencianol caused a dose-related (1-100 micrograms ml-1) reversal of contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline, angiotensin II, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and U-46619 (a thromboxane-A2 mimetic). Bencianol was more effective against contractions induced by EC50 compared to maximal concentrations of each agent, and was least effective against the thromboxane-A2 mimetic, U-46619. In addition, contractions induced by thromboxane-A2-like substances generated from guinea-pig lungs were also reversed by bencianol but only at the highest concentration used (100 micrograms ml-1). The relevance of this action of bencianol to migraine and cerebral arterial spasm is discussed.
