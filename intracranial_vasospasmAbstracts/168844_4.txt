Experimental cerebral vasospasm was studied in cat and monkey models. In the cat, the basilar artery was exposed by a transclival approach and spasm induced by the application of blood to the vessel. In the monkey, spasm was produced by injecting blood into the subarachnoid space. Vessel size was determined in the cat by direct observation and, in the monkey, by cerebral angiography. Several agents known to alter the synthsis and degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) were used to modity the vasospasm produced. Isoproterenol (Norisodrine) and aminophyline were effective in reversing cerebral vasospasm when applied topically and when administered parenterally. It is suggested that manipulation of the cyclic AMP pathways may be an effective method of controlling cerebral vasospasm.
