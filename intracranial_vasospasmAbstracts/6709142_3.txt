A model of chronic cerebral vasospasm (VSP) analogous to the clinical situation was established by inducing subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in monkeys. Platelets harvested from 4 ml of blood were added to autologous blood in an attempt to accentuate any effect that vasoactive substances such as serotonin, contained in platelets, might have on producing cerebral VSP. Antiserotonin medications were administered in an attempt to reduce the frequency or severity of angiographically proven VSP. Animals were divided into small (1 ml/kg) and large (1.2 to 1.5 ml/kg) hemorrhage groups and later were randomized equally to receive either saline placebo or reserpine (0.013 mg/kg i.m.) and kanamycin (50 mg/kg p.o.) administered 3 hours after SAH and daily thereafter to Day 7. In both the small and the large hemorrhage groups of treated animals, there was a significant reduction in serotonin levels (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively) compared to base line levels. In the groups of nontreated monkeys with small and large hemorrhages, serotonin levels were not statistically different from control values. Despite reduction of serotonin levels to 19 and 26% of the control values in the small and large hemorrhage, treated groups, there was no apparent difference in the frequency or severity of angiographically proven VSP. This study found no evidence that reserpine and kanamycin have a beneficial effect on preventing VSP when treatment is begun after SAH.
