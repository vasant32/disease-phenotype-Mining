Nimodipine was given as an intracarotid slow bolus injection in six patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to rupture of a cerebral aneurysm, with angiographically demonstrated vasospasm. The patients were followed by serial angiograms for demonstration of the effect of nimodipine on vasospasm. After angiography, all patients were treated with a constant venous infusion of this new calcium antagonist. Although the therapeutic regimen was started only a few hours after onset of vasospasm, there was no change in cerebral vessel caliber detectable on angiograms following the intracarotid injection. Three patients died, two patients finally recovered with neurological deficits due to cerebral ischemia, and one patient with asymptomatic vasospasm remained symptom-free. Although nimodipine may act to prevent cerebral vasospasm after SAH, the authors believe that the intracarotid application is not effective after vasospasm has occurred.
