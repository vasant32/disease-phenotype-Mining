Nicardipine, a calcium channel antagonist derivative of dihydropyridine, is a cerebral vasodilatator used in the treatment of cerebral vasospasms induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage after rupture of intracranial aneurysm. Hypocapnia is a powerful vasoconstrictor of cerebral arteries, and antagonizes in the baboon the cerebral vasodilative effect of nimodipine, another derivative of dihydropyridine. The action of nicardipine in presence of hypocapnia was not yet study in human. The study of the interaction of nicardipine and hypocapnia on the cerebral arteries show that hypocapnia antagonizes the cerebral vasodilatator properties of nicardipine.
