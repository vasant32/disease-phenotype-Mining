Haemoglobin and adenosine 5'-triposphate (ATP) released from lysed erythrocytes have been postulated to be responsible for delayed cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). However, the concentrations of haemoglobin and ATP in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients or in an animal model of vasospasm have not been reported. In this study, 12 mongrel dogs underwent a double blood injection via the cisterna magna on day 0 and 2, after an initial collection of CSF. On day 3, 5 or 7, the dogs were sacrificed after a second collection of CSF. An angiogram was recorded on day 0 and on the day of sacrifice. Results showed that the diameter of the dog's basilar artery was reduced 20% on day 3 (P > 0.05), 35% on day 5 (P < 0.05) and 45% on day 7 (P < 0.05). The concentrations of OxyHb, deOxyHb and MetHb in CSF were increased (P < 0.05), and all peaked on day 3. OxyHb and MetHb remained significantly higher than control (day 0) from day 3 to day 7, while deOxyHb remained at a high level on day 5 but returned to normal on day 7. In contrast, ATP was decreased (P < 0.05) on days 5 and 7 after SAH compared with day 0. The results indicate that haemoglobin might be involved in the development of cerebral vasospasm. The possible role of ATP in vasospasm remains unclear.
