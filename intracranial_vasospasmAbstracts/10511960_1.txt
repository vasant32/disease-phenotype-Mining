The authors present a case of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage that were verified as cerebral vasospasm by using both three-dimensional CT angioraphy (3 D-CTA) and conventional angiography. A 45-year-old man was referred to our department 4th day after sudden onset of a severe headache. On admission, emergency 3 D-CTA showed the cerebral vasospasm involving M 1 segment. Conventional angiography performed at the same day of the left internal carotid artery confirmed the cerebral vasospasm of the same vessel as 3 D-CTA, and furthermore demonstrated the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) genu aneurysms. The former was seen as a ruptured aneurysm from brain CT findings (Fisher group 3). On the 10th day after the onset, 3 D-CTA demonstrated the remaining severe cerebral vasospasm of the supraclinoid portion of left ICA and M 1 segment. Findings at the conventional angiography subsequently performed were concordant with those of 3 D-CTA. The patient was successfully treated with delayed surgical clipping for both aneurysms without the symptoms related to the cerebral vasospasm and discharged without neurological abnormality. We consider that 3 D-CTA shows promise as a minimally invasive method of evaluating the cerebral vasospasm and would take the place of the conventional angiography.
