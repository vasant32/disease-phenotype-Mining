Cerebral vasospasm induced by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is still a leading cause of morbidity and death. This 50-year-old man underwent surgery for aneurysm clipping. After the aneurysm was clipped, papaverine was instilled into the surgical area. Bradycardia, hypotension, and sinus arrest developed in the first minute after applying the papaverine. Thus, the authors concluded that the application of papaverine to the surgical area can result in fatal bradycardia and hypotension.
