The results of our surgical treatment of 1,000 patients with intracranial saccular aneurysm were analyzed with special consideration for age, site of aneurysm, preoperative condition and operative timing. The results on discharge were as follows: 543 cases, excellent; 186, good; 117, fair; 93, poor; and 61, dead. About three-fourths of the cases except for 23 cases of vertebrobasilar aneurysm showed either excellent or good result. The mortality rate became worse with aging. The results fairly correlated with the preoperative grades by Hunt and Hess (1968), but the cases of Grade Ia were unexpectedly worse. The timing of operation influenced the mortality rate; especially, the cases operated within 3 to 7 days following the last subarachnoid hemorrhage bore poor results. Follow-up studies revealed that excellent and good cases increased and poor cases decreased. The mortality rate for each year decreased annually to 2% in 1975. This improvement may be attributed to the advancement in the operative management with supplementary procedures and in the treatment for cerebral angiospasms and general condition.
