OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of endovascular embolization of internal carotid-posterior communicating artery (IC-PC) aneurysm. METHODS: 145 patients with IC-PC aneurysms underwent endovascular embolization through the microcatheter under digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Of the 145 cases, 55 patients with 62 aneurysms were embolized by mechanical detachable spiral (MDS) and 90 patients with 106 aneurysms were embolized by Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) or electrical detachable coil (EDC). RESULTS: 168 aneurysms in 145 patients, 96 of which with 100% embolization, 45 with 95% embolization, 15 with 90% embolization, and 12 with less than 90% embolization, were embolized successfully. During the surgery, aneurysm rupture occurred in 3 cases, cerebral vasospasm in 5, and cerebral infarction in 1 case. 118 cases were cured, 23 improved, and 3 died. 17 patients were followed-up by DSA, 3 aneurysms recurred and 2 were totally embolized with EDC for the second time. CONCLUSION: Endovascular embolization is a safe and effective therapeutic method for IC-PC aneurysm.
