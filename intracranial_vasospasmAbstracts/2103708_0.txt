The cerebral vasospasm secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm has a high morbidity/mortality. Its cause is still unknown, so we obtain controversial results after prevention and treatment. We studied two groups, of 29 patients each one, where the first was treated with systemic nimodipine, and the second was the control group. We did not observed any correlation between the clinic vasospasm or the symptomatic, and the radiographic one. There was no difference between the final results of both groups. No collateral effects were shown in other organs with the use of this agent.
