 BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasospasm (VSP) is a common complication after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but has rarely been reported after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) without subarachnoidal bleeding. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism is mainly mediated by circulating heme products within the cerebrospinal fluid, and thus patients with ICH and ventricular involvement (IVH) may also be in danger of developing VSP. The incidence and role of VSP in IVH, however, have not been systematically studied. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 115 patients with ICH with or without IVH into the study between April 2009 and April 2010. All patients received serial extracranial and transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) at baseline, on days 3-5 and 7-9 to detect and monitor VSP. In addition, CT scans taken on admission, after 24 h and before discharge were evaluated for the occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia. RESULTS: Three out of 53 patients (5.7%) with IVH showed a significant elevation of flow velocities over the examined timeframe. One of these patients developed severe VSP resulting in secondary ischemic infarction. None of the ICH patients without IVH showed significantly elevated flow velocities or secondary infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral VSP with secondary infarction may occur in patients with spontaneous IVH, though far less frequently than in SAH; thus, systematic screening of all patients with IVH may not be warranted. However, serial TCD should be considered in patients with secondary clinical worsening or extensive IVH.
