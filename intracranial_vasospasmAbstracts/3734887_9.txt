Cerebrovascular spasm in the cynomolgus monkey does not appear to be modified by nimodipine. It is possible that cerebral arteries from this species are unusually resistant to the action of calcium antagonists. To test this hypothesis, parallel studies on the in vitro response of cerebral arteries from monkey, dog, and man have been carried out. Rings of basilar or middle cerebral artery were tested with potassium chloride, noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and hemoglobin. The responses were then reexamined in the presence of various concentrations of nimodipine. There is a significant variation among species in sensitivity to nimodipine, the vessels from the monkey being more resistant to nimodipine than those from other species. There is, as expected, a considerable difference in the ability of nimodipine to block the different agonists. Responses to potassium chloride are blocked by low concentrations of nimodipine in all species, whereas noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine are more resistant. It is noteworthy that, in all species tested, hemoglobin and prostaglandin F2 alpha were antagonized poorly even by higher concentrations of nimodipine. If these agonists play a major role in the development of vasospasm and subsequent delayed ischemia, it may be that the calcium antagonists exert a beneficial effect by some mechanism other than dilation of spastic arteries.
