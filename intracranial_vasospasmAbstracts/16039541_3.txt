RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Perfusion-weighted computed tomography (CTP) is a relatively recent innovation that estimates a value for cerebral blood flow (CBF) using a series of axial head CT images tracking the time course of a signal from an intravenous contrast bolus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CTP images were obtained using a standard imaging protocol and were analyzed using commercially available software. A novel computer-based method was used for objective quantification of side-to-side asymmetries of CBF values calculated from CTP images. RESULTS: Our method corrects for the inherent variability of the CTP methodology seen in the subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patient population to potentially aid in the diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm (CVS). This method analyzes and quantifies side-to-side asymmetry of CBF and presents relative differences in a construct termed a Relative Difference Map (RDM). To further automate this process, we have developed a unique methodology that enables a computer to delineate vascular territories within a brain image, regardless of the size and shape of the brain. CONCLUSIONS: While both the quantification of image symmetry using RDMs and the automated assignment of vascular territories were initially designed for the analysis of CTP images, it is likely that they will be useful in a variety of applications.
