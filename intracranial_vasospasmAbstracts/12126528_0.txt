OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of emergency operation on ruptured anterior communicating artery. METHODS: Twenty-one cases of ruptured anterior communicating aneurysms, 9 of grade III, 10 of grade IV and 2 grade V according to Hunt-Hess classification, were treated by emergency clipping. RESULTS: By the time of being discharged from hospital, 16 patients were perfectly recovered, 2 suffered from moderated disability, 1 suffered from severe disability and 2 were dead. No patients of grade III before operation died. CONCLUSION: Emergency clipping of ruptured aneurysm of anterior communicating artery prevents death and deterioration of condition caused by aneurysmal re-rupture and relieves the secondary cerebral vasospasm, thus decreasing the mortality and improving the prognosis.
