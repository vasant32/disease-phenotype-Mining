During a 6-year period, 65 consecutive patients who had undergone anterior communicating artery aneurysmal surgery were reviewed at a follow-up examination from 6 to 78 months (mean 35 months) after operation. On admission 69% of cases had a good Hunt and Hess scale (grades I to II) and 31% a poor grade (grades III to V). The degree of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was determined by Fisher's grade. Sixteen (25%) patients were classified in grades I and II. Forty-six percent of cases had pre-existing hypertension. Early surgery (within the first three days after the bleeding) was performed in 17% of cases. Intraoperative rupture of aneurysm occurred in six (9.2%) patients. Symptomatic cerebral vasospasm was diagnosed in 14 (22%) cases, but only 8 (12%) had evidence of low density on the computerized tomographic scan. Hydrocephalus developed in 16 (25%) cases and 10 needed ventriculoperitoneal shunting. The outcome was determined using the activity of daily life. Sixty-five percent of the patients made a good recovery and 13.8% died. The significant poor prognostic factors included a poor pre-operative grade of the Hunt and Hess scale, the presence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, and the Fisher's SAH grade of greater than II. Other factors which apparently were not related to the outcome included age, sex, timing of surgery, history of hypertension, intraoperative rupture, and the development of hydrocephalus.
