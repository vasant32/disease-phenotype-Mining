During the past 2 years cerebral blood flow velocity was measured serially first of all in the middle cerebral arteries and in the bifurcation of the carotid arteries, less frequently in the other basal arteries by transcranial Doppler sonography in 36 head injured patients selected from 87 cerebral contusions and intracranial haematomas. Raised flow velocity referring to cerebral vasospasm was observed in 14 (40%) of 36 cases. Vasospasm developed between the 2nd and 8th days in the basal arteries, never on the first day. It was classified as slight (over 120 cm/sec) and sever (over 160 cm/sec) in the case of vasospasm lasting for several days. Development of vasospasm could be justified in 6 from 14 control angiographies. Authors' observations are compared with some literary data of traumatic vasospasm. The theoretical significance and practical usefulness of transcranial Doppler sonography in the study and follow up of the blood flow of the injured brain, especially in traumatic vasospasm, are emphasized.
