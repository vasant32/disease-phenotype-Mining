BACKGROUND: In animal models of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), basilar artery spasm has been described. Since fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) dilate rat basilar artery in vivo, we tested whether systemic administration of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) can reverse the basilar artery spasm following rat SAH. METHODS: SAH was mimicked by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna. We used a digital substraction angiography system in order to evaluate the spasmolytic effect of aFGF administered via the axillary artery 7 minutes after the injection of the autologous blood. Control animals received vehicle solution in the same manner. RESULTS: Intraarterial bolus injection of 2.6 micrograms aFGF, but not the solvent, reverses the acute basilar artery narrowing caused by SAH (23.05% of the baseline value at 5 minutes post-SAH). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an important role for FGFs in the cerebral tone regulation and support a clinical interest of FGFs in preventing cerebral ischemia following SAH, particularly if these vasoactive effects are added to the known neuroprotective effects of FGFs.
