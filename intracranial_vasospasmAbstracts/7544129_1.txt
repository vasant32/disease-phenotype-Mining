The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of endothelium in extraluminally induced vasospasm of the cerebral artery using isolated perfused canine basilar arteries. The extraluminal applications of high K+ and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) induced concentration-dependent vasoconstriction. Both constrictive responses were significantly enhanced by denuding endothelium. Additionally, the responses in the endothelium-intact arteries were markedly augmented by intraluminal perfusion with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). These results suggest that the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase in endothelium enhances increase in transmembrane Ca(2+)-influx which is a common constrictive mechanism to the vasoconstrictors. The augmentative action induced by L-NMMA was inhibited by intraluminal perfusion of L-arginine, but not by D-arginine. Furthermore, the augmentation was not observed in the arteries without endothelium. These results suggest that the endothelium may have a great significance on responsiveness to extraluminal vasoactive substances and that endothelium-derived NO may modulate the extraluminally induced vasoconstriction which is responsible for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
