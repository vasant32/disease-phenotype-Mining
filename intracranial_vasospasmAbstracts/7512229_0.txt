A 52-year-old female presented with localized but severe cerebral vasospasm induced by recurrent aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm was clipped and the subarachnoid hematoma evacuated 1 day after recurrent hemorrhage. The cerebral vasospasm, localized in a region near the MCA aneurysm, was reduced by papaverine and nicardipine vasodilating agents delivered via an Ommaya cerebrospinal fluid reservoir placed at craniotomy.
