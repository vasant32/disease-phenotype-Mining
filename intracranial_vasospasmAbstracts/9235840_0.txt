The vessels of the basis cerebri were histologically examined in 45 patients who had died from arterial aneurysmal rupture. Angiography had made at the clinic detected cerebral vasospasm of varying severity and extent. All autopsies showed ischemic encephalomalacia in specimens. The findings indicated that arteriostenosis angiographically identified as vasospasm, by causing ischemic events was induced by morphological changes in the arterial wall. The arterial structural changes found were characterized by subsequent changes in the intima, elastic membrane, and medial layer.
