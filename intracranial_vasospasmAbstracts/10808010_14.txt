BACKGROUND: Cortical blindness is a complication of severe preeclampsia, but it is unclear whether it results from cerebral vasospasm and ischemic injury or vasogenic (hydrostatic) edema due to increased capillary permeability. CASE: Reversible cortical blindness in a 33-year-old gravida 2, para 1, with severe postpartum preeclampsia after evacuation of a partial molar pregnancy at 19 weeks' gestation is presented. Initial neuroimaging studies showed hyperperfusion on head single-photon-emission computed tomography scan, which corresponded with lesions found on head computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans. Follow-up neuroimaging studies 2 weeks later, by which time the patient's visual acuity had returned to normal, showed complete resolution of radiologic abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Neuroimaging studies in a woman with severe postpartum preeclampsia complicated by reversible cortical blindness showed that blindness resulted from vasogenic (hydrostatic) cerebral edema and not cerebral vasospasm.
