Cerebral vasospasm secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage leads to increased cerebrovascular resistance and may cause ischemia in the affected vascular territories. The currently available therapeutic options for treating vasospasm are limited. The effect of ethanol at a concentration of 0.75 g/kg body weight on blood flow velocity in the major cerebral arteries was studied. In 31 healthy persons, the major extra- and intracranial cerebral vessels were examined by Doppler ultrasonography before and following oral ingestion of 0.75 g/kg body weight of ethanol. An additional 20 healthy subjects served as a control group. Ethanol in the applied concentration significantly increased the systolic, diastolic, and mean blood flow velocities and significantly decreased the pulsatility indices in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). It may reduce vascular resistance and may increase cerebral blood flow in the area supplied by the MCA in healthy persons.
