The relationship between plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) both of which show high values after subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm was studied. The subjects were 23 patients who were admitted because of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage during three years from March, 1989 to March, 1992 and in whom plasma ANP and ADH levels could be determined over time. Cerebral vasospasm was evaluated by the finding of cerebral angiography, clinical symptoms, and presence or not of low density areas on CT. Hyponatremia was defined as the serum sodium level of 130 mEq/l or less for two days or more. Angiographical vasospasm was found in 17 patients (85%), symptomatic vasospasm in 15 patients (65.2%), low density areas on CT in 9 patients (40.9%) and hyponatremia in 8 patients (34.8%). Symptomatic vasospasm was noted in 7 of the 8 patients (87.5%) with hyponatremia, low density areas on CT in 4 patients (50%), the detection rate being high. The plasma ANP and ADH levels were 76.7 +/- 32.1 pg/ml and 2.2 +/- 0.7 pg/ml respectively in the patients with symptomatic vasospasm against 38.3 +/- 21.3 pg/ml and 2.4 +/- 0.6 pg/ml respectively without symptomatic vasospasm, the plasma ANP level being significantly high in the patients with symptomatic vasospasm (p < 0.01). The plasma ANP and ADH were 71.2 +/- 33.8 pg/ml and 2.0 +/- 1.1 pg/ml respectively in the patients with low density areas on CT against 51.2 +/- 31.3 pg/ml and 1.8 +/- 0.5 pg/ml respectively without low density areas on CT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
