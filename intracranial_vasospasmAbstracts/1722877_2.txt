Eleven patients with a history of moderate or severe angiospasm following ruptured cerebral aneurysm developed spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage between 31 and 111 months after aneurysm surgery. In all cases, hemorrhage occurred in the ipsilateral hemisphere to the original aneurysm. In nine patients, the hematoma was surgically evacuated and bleeding perforating arteries were resected for histological examination. Computed tomographic scans showed the hematomas to be unusually extended compared to those after hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. The histological examination showed various degenerative changes in the elastic lamina and media of the perforating arteries, even though most patients were young and normotensive. These findings suggest that patients who have suffered severe cerebral angiospasm may have a higher risk for subsequent development of intracerebral hemorrhage than those without prior angiospasm.
