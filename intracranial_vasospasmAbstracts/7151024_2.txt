In this series of intracerebral hematomas from aneurysmal rupture, gathered from several neurosurgical services, certain morphological features were studied in detail. Patients with very large hematomas tended to have poor neurological grades on admission to hospital and their immediate discharge outlook was correspondingly poor. Ruptured middle cerebral and pericallosal artery aneurysms were relatively common causes of intracerebral hematomas. Patients with temporal lobe hematoma did relatively well; those with parietal hematoma did poorly. The larger the hematoma the less chance there was of developing cerebral vasospasm but the more likely was pre-operative brain herniation. The survival was more closely linked to size and location of the hematoma than to the location of aneurysm or the degree of midline shift.
