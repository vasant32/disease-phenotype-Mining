This is a retrospective study of 100 cases of intracranial aneurysms, treated in an Indian hospital, reflecting the special situation and experiences in our country. The incidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage due to ruptured aneurysm has been more or less the same as is reported from other parts of the world. The cases of recurrent haemorrhage resulting in poor clinical status are more common in our situation. Delayed referral and diagnosis were responsible for recurrent haemorrhage, increased morbidity and mortality. Forty two percent developed cerebral vasospasm within two weeks after the bleed. The use of a temporary clip on the parent vessel prevented the intraoperative rupture of the aneurysm while dissecting round about the aneurysm. Operative mortality was eight percent in the present series.
