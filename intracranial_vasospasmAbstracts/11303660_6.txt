We report a case of pituitary macroadenoma that developed symptomatic vasospasm 12 days after transsphenoidal removal, but showed an excellent recovery following active treatment identical to those for vasopasm following aneurysmal subarachonid haemorrhage. Subarachnoid haematoma in the basal cisterns secondary from postoperative intracapsular haemorrhage was the most probable cause of the vasopasm.
