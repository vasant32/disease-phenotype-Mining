Cerebral vasospasm (CV) accounts significant morbimortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcome of patients with CV treated by 2 endovascular procedures: intra-arterial nimodipine angioplasty (IANA) and balloon angioplasty (BA). Between 2008 and June 2011, we performed 22 IANA and 8 BA in 30 patients. The mean age was 44 years and 60% was female. In 17 patients, the treatment was clipping, whereas 13 underwent coil treatment. The CV was severe in 63%, moderate in 30%, and mild in 7%. Good outcome between 2 groups was similar (P = .36). The clinical outcome according to the subgroups of CV severity and modality treatment was equivalent (P = .22). Mortality at 3 months was 16% and 20% at 1 year. We did not find differences in the clinical outcome despite the fact that both techniques produce adequate angiographic resolution of CV.
