Eight patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) received intrathecal sodium nitroprusside therapy (ITSNPT) in the form of intermittent bolus doses for delayed cerebral vasospasm after undergoing clipping of an aneurysm. Five patients were administered ITSNPT to combat refractory symptomatic vasospasm while three patients received prophylactic ITSNPT in view of the possibility of imminent clinical vasospasm. In five patients the therapy was instituted through the intraventricular route, while in three the drug was instilled into the basal cistern. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was administered at an interval of 3-12 h, in varying bolus doses ranging between 2 and 5 mg depending upon the (i) mean flow velocity values on transcranial Doppler study and (ii) clinical response. The end point of ITSNPT was either relief of vasospasm, any adverse effect or contraindication to continuation of ITSNPT. All except one patient survived. One patient had mild residual neurological deficit following an infarct. All the three patients who received prophylactic ITSNPT had good outcomes.
