 OBJECTIVE: Cerebral vasospasm is the commonest cause for mortality and morbidity in patients following clipping of a ruptured aneurysm. Selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor like sildenafil acts as a vasodilator. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of oral sildenafil citrate in patients with symptomatic refractory vasospasm. METHODS: A total of 832 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid bleed were operated in 4 years. Two hundred and seventy-three patients had vasospasm. Of these, 72 patients had refractory cerebral vasospasm. Vasospasm was defined as refractory when institution of "HHH" failed to reverse the transcranial Doppler (TCD) values even after 24 hours. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed no infarct, hematoma, or hydrocephalus, and the serum electrolytes were within normal limits. They received 100-150 mg of sildenafil every 4 hours. Response was evaluated by 2-hourly TCD. RESULTS: Eight patients had sustained (TCD values normal for >48 hours) and four had temporary relief in vasospasm, as suggested. Four patients developed complications significant enough to terminate the therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil citrate may be effective in patients with refractory symptomatic vasospasm. It calls upon the pharmacologists and scientists to discover newer supraselective PDE inhibitors, specific to PDE receptors in brain vessels.
