Vasospasm of the basilar artery in 57 cats was induced by application of fresh blood, or a blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mixture incubated at 37 degrees C for 2 to 16 days. In animals treated with fresh blood or mixtures incubated for over 15 days, the severity of induced vasoconstriction is slight and duration short. Mixtures incubated 5 to 10 days induced severe and prolonged vasoconstriction. This incubation period for blood and CSF mixtures inducing severe vasospasm coincides with the developmental period of vasospasm after the onset of subarachnoid hemorrhage in our clinical experience. The prolongation of severe vasoconstriction induced by mixtures incubated for 7 days with clotted components is definitely greater than one induced by a mixture without clotted components. This experimental study suggests the existence of a vasospasmogenic substance in the blood in the subarachnoid space. Activity begins about 3 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage, increases strongly at 5 to 10 days, and disappears after 15 days.
