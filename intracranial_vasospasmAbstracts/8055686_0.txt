Many patients survive SAH with minimal neurologic deficits but are at risk for developing further neurologic insult from ischemia resulting from cerebral vasospasm. Nursing care of the patient experiencing vasospasm is challenging. The nurse who is knowledgeable about the signs and symptoms of cerebral ischemia and necessity for continually reviewing the patient's neurologic status can initiate prompt treatment to prevent further ischemic damage. Recognition of this critical problem is the first step toward combating its ominous effects.
