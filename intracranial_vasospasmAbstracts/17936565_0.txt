Delayed neurological deficit occurs among 30% of patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, mainly related to cerebral vasospasm. The early detection of cerebral ischemia remains problematic. Conventional cerebral monitoring (as intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure) appears to be insufficient, because cerebral ischemia may occur without elevated intracranial pressure. Global cerebral monitoring as venous jugular oxygen saturation are useful for regional monitoring. Local monitoring as oxygen tissue partial pressure (PtiO2) and microdialysis are sensible for brain ischemia detection, but may also ignore episodes occurring in non-monitored brain area. For the detection of most episodes of brain ischemia, several monitoring system should be use performing a multimodal intracerebral monitoring. Brain microdialysis and oxygen tissue partial pressure are promising monitoring system.
