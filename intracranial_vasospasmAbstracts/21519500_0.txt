The intra-arterial administration of nimodipine (IAN) is commonly used for cerebral vasospasm refractory to medical treatments. We report two cases of vasogenic edema after IAN. Our patients with aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage presented with vasospasm, which was treated by IAN. Consequently, vasogenic edema developed in the basal ganglia. Reperfusion following IAN for vasospasm may have the potential for inciting vasogenic edema in the ischemic brain.
