We describe a new computer-based, automated method for the assessment of in vivo cerebral vasospasm. Arterial diameter measurements were performed on post-processed digital substraction angiographic images, using "pixel" as the unit. Vasospasm which was difficult to detect by visual inspection could be measured by the "stenosis quantification" program. A computer-assisted method such as we describe might decrease the risk of subjective errors.
