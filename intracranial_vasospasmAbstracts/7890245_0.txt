To examine the possible role of endothelin and vasospasm in eclamptic seizures, we studied and analyzed the electroencephalograms (EEG) of endothelin-1 (ET-1)-treated pregnant, nonpregnant and sham control (dextrose-treated) rabbits. After multiple intravenous bolus injections of ET-1 (500 pmol/kg) or 5% dextrose in the rabbits, we recorded EEG directly from the brain cortex and analyzed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Water content was measured in the brain of all groups (n = 7). Repeated seizures occurred in all of the pregnant and 2 of the nonpregnant rabbits by variable doses of ET-1. FFT analysis showed remarkable changes in frequency and power arrays characterized by mild to severe form of dysrhythmia, high-voltage spikes, high-voltage fast and slow waves after ET-1 injections. Water content was increased in brain mass in ET-1-treated rabbits (p = 0.001) suggesting an ET-1-induced edema. Histologically we confirmed that ET-1 caused ischemic changes in brain tissues. However, ET-1 induced more pronounced changes in behavior, EEG, brain edema or ischemia in pregnant than in nonpregnant groups. The injections of exogenous ET-1 into the brain substances were strongly suggested by immunohistochemical study with polyclonal antiendothelin antibody in brain tissue sections. Therefore, we assume that endothelin along with other vasoactive substances causes acute cerebral vasospasm and ischemia inducing EEG changes leading to ultimate clinical convulsions in eclampsia.
