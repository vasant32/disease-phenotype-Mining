BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a platelet-derived bioactive lipid that exerts a variety of biological responses, including vasocontraction. To understand the involvement of S1P in cerebral vasospasm, we investigated the effect of S1P on vasocontraction of the canine basilar artery in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We recorded isometric tension in basilar arterial rings from dogs in vitro and estimated time-course changes in the diameter of canine basilar arteries and the S1P concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by angiography and radioreceptor assays, respectively, after administering S1P into the cisterna magna. Changes in the supernatant S1P concentration during clot formation were monitored by using the in vitro subarachnoid hemorrhage model, in which blood is mixed with CSF. RESULTS: At concentrations ranging between 100 nmol/L and 10 micromol/L, S1P induced a dose-dependent contraction of the basilar artery in vitro. This effect was significantly inhibited by Y-27632, a highly selective Rho-kinase inhibitor. The administration of S1P into the CSF induced a 60% to 70% decrease in the arterial diameter within 15 minutes, and vasocontraction continued for 2 days thereafter. The concentration of S1P in the supernatant during clot formation in vitro reached approximately 300 nmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: S1P induces vasocontraction in the canine basilar artery in vitro and in vivo, possibly through a mechanism involving activation of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway. Thus, S1P might be considered as a novel spasmogenic substance involved in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
