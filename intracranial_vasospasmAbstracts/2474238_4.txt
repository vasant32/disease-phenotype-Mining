Disruption of the blood-arterial wall barrier in the major cerebral arteries occurs following subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and may be related to the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm. Using FITC dextrans of various sizes, the present study was undertaken to determine if the barrier disruption shortly after SAH occurs equally to various sized tracers. Forty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups. Four groups were injected with FITC-dextrans of differing molecular weights (MW): FD4 (MW = 4,080), FD 40 (MW = 40,500), FD 70 (MW = 71,400), and FD 150 (MW = 156,900). One group was injected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP: MW = 40,000). Each group was further divided into two subgroups: with or without SAH. SAH was induced by injecting arterial blood into the cisterna magna. To assess the integrity of the blood-arterial wall barrier by transmission electron microscope, the tracers were intravenously injected prior to sacrificing the animals. The groups without SAH showed no permeability of tracers into the subendothelial spaces of the basilar arteries. In contrast, with the exception of FD 150, FITC-dextrans (FD 4, FD 40, FD 70) were noticed in the subendothelial spaces. The distribution of FITC-dextrans in the elastic lamina was similar to that of HRP. These results suggest that barrier disruption occurs with a wide range of molecular sizes of FITC-dextrans, although there seems to be some limitation to the permeation of the larger molecules. The present study suggests that the mechanism of barrier disruption of the major cerebral arteries in the acute stage following SAH may be vesicular rather than by separation of tight junctions.
