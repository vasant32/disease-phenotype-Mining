The authors have studied the ability of prostacyclin to reverse contractions of human basilar arteries in vitro that were induced by a wide range of substances implicated in the etiology of cerebral arterial spasm. Prostacyclin (10(-10) to 10(-6)M) caused a dose-related reversal of contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline, angiotensin II, prostaglandin (PG)F2 alpha, and U-46619 (a thromboxane-A2 mimetic). These agents were tested at concentrations or volumes that produced almost maximum or maximum responses and those that produced approximately 50% of the maximum response. Contractions induced by maximum concentrations of angiotensin II and U-46619 were least affected by prostacyclin. In addition, contractions induced by thromboxane-A2 generated from guinea-pig lung were reversed in a dose-dependent fashion by prostacyclin. This ability of prostacyclin to physiologically antagonize contractions of the human basilar artery in vitro induced by high concentrations of various spasmogenic agents suggests that such a potent vasodilator agent or more stable analogue may be of value in the treatment of such disorders as cerebral arterial spasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.
