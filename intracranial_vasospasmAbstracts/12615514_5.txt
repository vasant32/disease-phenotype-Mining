Platelets have long been implicated in the aetiology of cerebral vasospasm (CV) after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). It was noticed that vasospastic CSF (CSF(V)) could be formed in vitro by the mixing of control blood (with platelets) and non-SAH CSF. We also propose a hypothesis for the aetiology of CV after SAH based on this and previous research. This study also aims to determine which blood fraction is responsible for the stimulation of O(2) consumption and vasospasm of blood vessels. Control blood was separated into various fractions and mixed with non-SAH CSF. The activity of the resulting mixture and the blood fraction alone were assessed. Only the fractions containing platelets mixed with CSF showed vasoactivity. These data suggest that platelets plus some component in the CSF produce vasoactive factors with actions similar to CSF(V). This study may help to elucidate the aetiology of CV after SAH.
