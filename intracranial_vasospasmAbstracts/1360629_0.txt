To understand the molecular mechanism of the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid haemorrhage, we analysed the effect of cerebrospinal fluid from patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage on DNA synthesis and cytosolic-free calcium elevation in cultured porcine cerebral smooth muscle cells. Cerebrospinal fluid from patients on day 2 after subarachnoid haemorrhage induced transient elevation in cytosolic-free calcium levels. In contrast, the maximal elevation of cytosolic-free calcium levels induced by cerebrospinal fluid from control patients (without subarachnoid haemorrhage) was significantly lower than that induced by cerebrospinal fluid from patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. In cultured porcine cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells, cerebrospinal fluid from patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage promoted levels of [3H]-thymidine incorporation (DNA synthesis) more than 2.5-fold higher than that promoted by cerebrospinal fluid from control patients without subarachnoid haemorrhage. However, in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells, there was no significant difference in [3H]-thymidine incorporation between cerebrospinal fluid from patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and that by control cerebrospinal fluid. From these results in cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells, cerebrospinal fluid from patients following subarachnoid haemorrhage may play not only constrictive functions, evidenced by cytosolic-free calcium elevations, but also proliferative functions, demonstrated by promotion of [3H]-thymidine incorporation. The relevance of these factors to vasospasm will be discussed.
