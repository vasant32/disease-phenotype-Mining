Within the last ten years, twenty pregnant women with ruptured intracranial aneurysms were managed at Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center. Difficulties encountered in the care of these patients will be illustrated with case studies. In two patients, failure to diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage delayed management. In another patient, cerebral vasospasm complicated the course. Selection of appropriate diagnostic tests, timing of surgery, importance of fetal monitoring, and method of delivery will be discussed.
