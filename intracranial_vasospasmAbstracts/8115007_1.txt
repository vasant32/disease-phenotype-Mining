Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are intrinsic vasodilatory substances contained in perivascular nerve fibers innervating large intracranial arteries. Effects of these substances on delayed cerebral vasospasm were examined using a rabbit model of experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Sixty-one anesthetized rabbits received intrathecal fresh arterial blood on day-1 and intrathecal administration of different doses of CGRP, VIP or distilled water on day-4. Prior to the treatment, caliber of the spastic basilar artery was 73.4 +/- 0.9% of pre-SAH values. Serial angiograms after treatment demonstrated that 10(-10)mol/kg of CGRP dilated the spastic artery to 117.1% of pre-SAH levels and that dilatory effect of CGRP continued up to 6 hours after treatment. VIP injection also brought arterial dilatation up to 114.9% of pre-SAH levels, although the duration of the effect was less than 3 hours. Intrathecal administration of CGRP or VIP showed no adverse effect on the systemic and neurological state of the animals. These results indicate that intrathecal CGRP and VIP have therapeutic potential in treating delayed cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Further investigations are expected to extend the effect of CGRP and VIP.
