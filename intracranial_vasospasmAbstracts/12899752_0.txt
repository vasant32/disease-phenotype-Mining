OBJECTIVE: To investigate the curative effect of Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) on acute ruptured intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: The clinical data of 34 patients with acute rupture of intracranial aneurysms treated with early GDC embolization within 6 days after the rupture, 6 being of grade I, 23 of grade II, 4 of grade III and 1 of grade IV according to Hunt-Hess grading, were analyzed retrospectively. Fourteen patients were treated within 3 days, and 20 patients were treated in the 4th to 6th days after the rupture. Two cases of wide-neck aneurysm were embolized with Medtronic AVE stent supported GDC. Angiography was used to observe the effects. RESULTS: Angiography showed complete occlusion in 28 cases and 90% occlusion in 4 cases. One aneurysm was ruptured during the procedure. The caudal tip of GDC protruded to the parent vessel in 2 cases. Two cases failed to be embolized due to severe cerebrovascular spasm. There were no mortality and complications. No re-rupture occurred in the follow-up. CONCLUSION: Less invasive and with less risk and complication, early GDC embolization is one of the ideal therapeutic methods to manage acute ruptured aneurysms.
