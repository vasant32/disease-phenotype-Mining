Cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage is very common, but it is not universally detectable by transcranial Doppler. SPECT imaging of regional cerebral blood flow with Tc-99m exametazime serves as a complementary test to transcranial Doppler in the evaluation of patients at high risk for vasospasm. The significance of vasospasm, which may be underestimated by TCD, is readily identified with SPECT cerebral perfusion imaging.
