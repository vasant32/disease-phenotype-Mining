One of the important histological changes in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is endothelial cell damage, which involves apoptosis. The current study was undertaken to determine whether anti-apoptosis therapy prevents apoptosis and reverses vasospasm in a dog SAH model. Twenty-three mongrel dogs of either sex, weighing 17-25 kg, were subjected to autologous arterial blood injection into the cisterna magna on day 0 and day 2, and sacrificed on day 7. Angiography was performed on day 0 before blood injection and on day 7 before sacrifice. Caspase-2 (Z-VDVAD-FMK, 10 microM) inhibitor, caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK, 10 microM) inhibitor, or vehicle (DMSO) were injected intrathecally from day 2 to day 6. The effects of caspase inhibitors on apoptosis and vasospasm were evaluated by angiography and transmission electron microscopy. The residual diameter of the basilar artery on day 7 in SAH dogs without treatment was 53.4+/-5.5% of the day 0 diameter. Marked damage to the endothelial cells, including apoptotic like changes, was observed in these arteries. Both caspase inhibitors prevented apoptosis in the endothelial cells. Only caspase-3 inhibitor, however, had a near-significant effect on reducing 13.3% of angiographic vasospasm. Higher doses and early treatment, as well as other more potent apoptosis inhibitors, are recommended for future studies.
