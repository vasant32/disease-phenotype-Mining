OBJECT: The current study was undertaken to determine whether melatonin therapy reverses vasospasm and prevents apoptosis by inhibiting lipid peroxidation in an experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rabbits were divided into four groups as follows: Group 1, SAH + melatonin (5 mg/kg/i.p. BID) simultaneously with SAH (n = 6); Group 2, SAH + melatonin (5 mg/kg/i.p. BID) treated 2 hours after SAH (n = 6); Group 3, control group (n = 4); Group 4, SAH only (n = 6). Light microscopic examinations of the basilar arteries were performed to demonstrate the pathophysiological changes of the arterial wall with hematoxylin- eosin. Apoptosis: Immunohistology using the ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit was used to demonstrate apoptosis in a cross section of basilary arteries. Apoptotic index was calculated as the number of the immunoreactive nuclei per total number of endothelial cells, and expressed as a percentage. RESULTS: The results of measurements of diameters of the vessels between groups were significantly different (p = 0.028). While basilar arteries of the SAH only group showed 57% constriction, Groups 1 and 2 were calculated as 33 and 26% constriction, respectively, compared with the control group (p < 0.05). And also Groups 1 and 2 showed significant protection of apoptosis compared with Group 4. The difference between the four groups was tested by Kruskal-Wallis test and the significance between the two groups was tested by Mann- Whitney U-test. CONCLUSION: Melatonin with its strong antioxidant effect can prevent SAH-induced vasospasm and apoptosis of endothelial cells of vessels.
