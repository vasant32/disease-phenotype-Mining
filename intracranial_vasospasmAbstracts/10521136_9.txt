Head injury is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the young population. Many factors complicate head injury and worsen an outcome. One of these factors is posttraumatic cerebral vasospasm. We studied 75 patients admitted to the University of Mississippi Medical Center with head injury. Their ages ranged from 14 to 67 years (mean 30 years, SD 11.63). Eighty percent of the patients were men, and 20% were women. Of these patients, 53 (70.6%) suffered severe blunt trauma, and 4 patients suffered gunshot wounds to the head. Four patients had mild head injury, and 14 had moderate head injury. Posttraumatic vasospasm was detected in 24 (32%) patients. Among these patients, 19 (79.2%) had severe closed head injury, 3 patients had moderate head injury, and 2 suffered gunshot wounds. The severity of the patient's respective condition was correlated with the development of posttraumatic cerebral vasospasm: 50% of the patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 3-4 developed PTV, and only 30% with GCS 9-11, and none of the patients with GCS > 12 developed PTV. Overall, posttraumatic vasospasm started earlier and had a shorter course than did aneurysmal vasospasm. Morphologically, posttraumatic vasospasm resembled the features of aneurysmal vasospasm. We found increased corrugation of the internal elastic lamina and increased amounts of connective tissue in the subendothelial layer. These findings show that posttraumatic vasospasm, although clinically more mild, demonstrates the same morphological changes as aneurysmal vasospasm.
