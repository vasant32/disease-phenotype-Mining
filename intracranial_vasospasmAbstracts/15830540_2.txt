To investigate cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 65 cases were analyzed by the incidence of delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND). Eighty-four consecutive cases, who underwent surgery within 72 hours of SAH, were retrospectively analyzed. Sixty-five of these patients had diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage in CT scan and had aneurysms of the anterior circulation. They were divided into two groups according to the operative procedure: Group A (35 cases) had radical clot removal therapy with urokinase in 5% glucose solutions using a bipolar irrigation system; Group B (30 cases) had conventional clot removal using manual irrigation. There were no significant differences between these two groups for age or pre-operative WFNS grade. The incidence of DIND was 17.1% in group A and 40.0% in groupB; this was a significant difference. Radical clot removal therapy was effective in preventing DIND due to vasospasm.
