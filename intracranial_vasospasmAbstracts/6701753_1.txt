The incidence and severity of cerebral vasospasm and hydrocephalus following induced subarachnoid hemorrhage in an experimental group of animals that subsequently received epsilon-aminocaproic acid was compared to that seen in a control group that received no antifibrinolytic therapy. No augmentation of either vasospasm or hydrocephalus could be attributed to the epsilon-aminocaproic acid in the treated as compared to the control group.
