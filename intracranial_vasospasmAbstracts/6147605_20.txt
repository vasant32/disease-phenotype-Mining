Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been demonstrated in the human circle of Willis by specific radioimmunoassay. Concentrations were similar in cadaver and peroperative specimens. NPY concentrations were highest around the basilar bifurcation (2.9 +/- 1.0 pmol/g), anterior cerebral artery (2.7 +/- 0.5 pmol/g), and carotid trifurcation (2.4 +/- 0.6 pmol/g). Concentrations were lowest in the basilar artery (1.0 +/- 0.4 pmol/g). Intracarotid administration of NPY (50 pmol to 2 nmol) to rats reduced mean cerebral cortical blood flow by 40-98%. This vasoconstriction lasted for at least 2 h. These findings suggest that NPY may be involved in the cerebral vasospasm which follows subarachnoid haemorrhage and in the maintenance of normal vascular tone.
