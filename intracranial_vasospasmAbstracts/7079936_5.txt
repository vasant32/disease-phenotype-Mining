Patients suffering from a subarachnoid hemorrhage who were admitted to the Neurosurgical Unit of the Royal Perth Hospital during the period 1971 to 1979 were assessed with regard to the effectiveness of preoperative treatment with epsilon-aminocaproic acid, kanamycin, and reserpine. Forty-two patients who were treated with epsilon-aminocaproic acid had a rebleed rate of 2.3% compared to 1 9.7% rebleed rate in appropriately selected controls. Patients treated with kanamycin and reserpine had a preoperative cerebral vasospasm rate of 32% compared to a 26% rate in controls; however, kanamycin and reserpine were found useful for decreasing the postoperative complications of cerebral vasospasm.
