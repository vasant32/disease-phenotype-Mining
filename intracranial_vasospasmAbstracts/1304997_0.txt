Using radioimmunoassay, fluorescence and transmittal++ electronmicroscopy, we studied the of prostaglandin(PG), lipid peroxidation(LPO) and ultrastructure. Fresh arterial blood (imaging acute spasm) produced basilar arterial spasm strongly(+ + +) and vacuole deterioration in vascular walls but there were no changes in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 and PGE2 and LPO. Incubated arterial blood (imaging chronic spasm) produced basilar arterial spasm markedly (+ + +) also. Vacuole deterioration in vascular walls either, and decreased the level of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha apparently (P < 0.01) and elevated the content of LPO significantly (P < 0.01) and there were no changes in the level of TXB2 and PGE alpha. This experiment suggests that the mechanism of acute spasm and chronic spasm is different.
