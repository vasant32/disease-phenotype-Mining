Delayed cerebral arterial spasm was induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage in 11 rhesus monkeys. Ten monkeys (62%) developed spasm. Of seven monkeys treated with salbutamol (a beta2-adrenergic stimulating drug), five had relief of vasospasm. Four monkeys, one of which had failed to respond to salbutamol alone, were treated with salbutamol and aminophylline (a phosphodiesterase-inhibiting drug), and all four were relieved of their vasospasm. When considered as one group, the monkeys had an 81% response rate. The authors suggest that a combination of beta2-adrenergic stimulation and phosphodiesterase-inhibition might be of value in preventing or treating delayed cerebral arterial pressure.
