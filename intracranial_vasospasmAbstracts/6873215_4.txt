Using 20 rabbits, we tried to establish a new model of experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) for examining both acute and chronic cerebral vasospasm. A cranial opening was drilled, and a puncture made on the posterior branch of the middle cerebral artery. A second puncture was made in the superior sagittal sinus for additional withdrawal of subarachnoid blood. The bleeding thus induced resulted in arterial spasm which was studied by using serial electrocorticograms, cerebral blood flow measurement with 133Xe, and videomicroscopy of the small pial vessels at various intervals. After death of the animals, the brains were observed to identify the extention of the bleeding. It was indeed obvious that large amounts of subarachnoid blood clots had accumulated. This investigation showed that the rabbit can be used as a new experimental model of SAH. With a two-puncture method, it is possible to simulate the clinical phenomenon of a ruptured aneurysm, that seems to produce acute and chronic cerebral vasospasm. For the latter, the accumulation of blood clots in the basal surfaces plays an important role. The three methods of observation, videomicroscopy, cerebral blood flow measurements, and electrocorticography appeared to provide useful information in the study of biphasic vasospasm in the rabbit.
