We describe two patients who had cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage that was refractory to intraarterial injection of papaverine. Both patients were successfully treated with intraarterial injection of amrinone after intraarterial injection of papaverine. It is suggested that intraarterial amrinone, which has a vasodilatory action, may be therapeutically useful for cerebral vasospasm.
