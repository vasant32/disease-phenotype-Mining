 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) remains unknown in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In this study, we examined the effects of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) inactivation on cerebral vasospasm in the endovascular perforation model of SAH in rats. METHODS: Rats were assigned to sham, SAH plus vehicle, and SAH plus imatinib mesylate (imatinib) groups (n = 4 per group). Imatinib (50 mg/kg body weight), an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases of PDGFR, or vehicle was administered intraperitoneally 30 min post-SAH. Vasospasm was evaluated in the left (perforation-sided) internal carotid artery by means of neurobehavioral tests, India ink angiography, and immunohistochemistry at 24 h after SAH. RESULTS: Imatinib significantly inhibited post-SAH PDGFR activation in the left internal carotid artery, in which vasospasm was significantly prevented. Animal's neurobehavior also showed a tendency to improve by imatinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PDGF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm after SAH.
