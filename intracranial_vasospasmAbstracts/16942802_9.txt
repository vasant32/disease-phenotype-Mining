Injection of blood into the cisterna magna is one of the most frequently used methods to produce subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) models in animals. Although the two-hemorrhage model of vasospasm is frequently used in canine and rat models, most studies with rabbits only use the one-hemorrhage model. In the present study, we accomplished a side-by-side comparison between one- and two-hemorrhage models in rabbits. A total of 38 rabbits were randomly divided into three groups, i.e. control group (n = 5), one (n = 15)- and two (n = 18)-hemorrhage model groups. The degree of cerebral vasospasm, the time course of cerebral vasospasm, the clinical behavior, and the residual amount of subarachnoid blood clots were measured on days 3, 5 and 7 after the establishment of the models. Compared with one-hemorrhage model, the time course of vasospasm in the two-hemorrhage model was more coincident with that observed in humans, produced more severe vasospasm after SAH, and had an acceptable low mortality. In conclusion, the two-hemorrhage model in rabbits is more appropriate than the one-hemorrhage model for the research on SAH or cerebral vasospasm, and thus can be used for the investigation of the mechanisms of and therapeutic approaches for cerebral vasospasm.
