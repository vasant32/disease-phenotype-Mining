In recent experimental studies the beneficial therapeutic effect of the arachidonic acid metabolite prostacyclin (PG 12) has been demonstrated for the treatment of different states of impaired brain perfusion following subarachnoid hemorrhage or focal cerebral ischemia. Prostacyclin has been recommended especially for the possible prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysm rupture. Because prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator of the cerebral circulation it is an essential prerequisite for a possible therapeutic use of PG 12 that no negative side effects concerning the intracranial pressure are allowed to occur during intravenous infusion of the drug. In our study we therefore investigated the course of intracranial pressure during continuous experimental perfusion with prostacyclin in four different dosages. The results and our conclusions concerning further experimental or clinical studies with prostacyclin are presented.
