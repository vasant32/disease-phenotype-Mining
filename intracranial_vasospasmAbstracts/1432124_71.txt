This report describes the successful treatment of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage with superselective intra-arterial infusion of papaverine hydrochloride. Thirty-seven vascular territories in 10 patients with symptomatic vasospasm were treated according to the following protocol. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed in two steps. First, a silicone balloon was used for dilation of the internal carotid artery and the proximal portions of the middle cerebral artery. A silicone leak balloon or Tracker-18 catheter was then introduced into or just proximal to the site of vasospasm not accessible to the angioplasty balloon catheter for superselective infusion of 0.2% papaverine. Thirty-four of 37 vascular territories were successfully dilated, and eight of 10 patients showed improvement in neurological function after the procedure. There were no serious side effects due to infusion of papaverine. It is essential to infuse the papaverine just proximal to the spastic vessels in order to deliver sufficient concentration of drug, and infusion should be carried out as early as possible before the artery loses its ability to return to a normal luminal size. Superselective intraarterial infusion of papaverine is an alternative method of treatment for symptomatic vasospasm.
