A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) model in rats was produced by the injection of homologous blood into the cisterna magna. Effects of AJ-3941 ((+/-)-(E)-1-(3-fluoro-6,11 -dihydrodibenz[b,e]-oxepine-11-yl)-4-(3-phenyl-2-propenyl)-p iperazine dimaleate, CAS 143110-70-7) on the development of cerebral vasospasm and the change of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) following SAH was investigated in this model. Cerebral vasospasm following SAH showed a biphasic pattern with an early phrase at 10 min and a late phrase on 1 day after blood injection. The physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate and blood gas contents) remained stable within the physiological range throughout the course of the experiment. AJ-3941 (0.01 mg/kg i.v. or 0.3 mg/kg p.o.) significantly prevented the development of late phase cerebral vasospasm. Cisternal injection of homologous blood significantly reduced rCBF immediately after the injection and the reduction lasted during the observation period (30 min). Reduction in rCBF after the injection of homologous blood was prevented by AJ-3941 (0.01 mg/kg i.v.). rCBF in AJ-3941-treated rats completely returned to the basal values after 30 min. The present suggest that AJ-3941 may be useful in the prevention of late spasm and in the improvement of cerebral circulation impaired with SAH.
