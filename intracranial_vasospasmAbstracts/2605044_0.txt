Among 528 cases with ruptured aneurysm, 10 cases (1.9%) developed hemorrhagic infarction following vasospasm. There was no obvious relationship between the occurrence and location of aneurysm and the neurological grade on admission. Hemorrhagic infarction occurred from day 9 to 25 (mean day 16) after aneurysmal rupture, and the major neurological symptoms were aggravation of consciousness level, which appeared in 6 cases. On the CT scans of the hemorrhagic infarction following vasospasm, nine cases revealed heterogeneous hemorrhage as assembled of spotty or linear hemorrhages within the ischemic infarction, and 5 cases had massive hemorrhagic infarction in size with mass effect. Although surgical therapy for 2 cases and conservative therapy for 8 cases were performed, the results were unfavorable; ie, 2 cases were good, 5 fair or poor, and 3 died. Especially, 5 cases with massive hemorrhagic infarction obviously resulted in poor prognosis. In our series, induced hypertension therapy for vasospasm was considered as a risk factor. In conclusion, it is necessary to avoid induced hypertension therapy in the remission stage of vasospasm and serial SPECT study might be recommended as a useful prospective method estimating the vasospasm.
