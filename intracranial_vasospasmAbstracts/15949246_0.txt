OBJECT: We wished to determine the inhibitory effect of deuterium oxide (D(2)O) on cerebral vasospasm (CVS) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS AND RESULTS: An established rabbit single-hemorrhage was used. Thirty-five rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: non-treatment, sham control, lower-D(2)O, and higher-D(2)O treatment groups. Angiography was performed before (day 0) and after (day 2) SAH and the CVS ratio was calculated by comparing the diameter of the basilar artery (BA) on day 2 with that on day 0. After death, blood clot volume was assessed and the BA was dissected from the brain for histological examination. The CVS ratio in D(2)O-treatment groups was significantly higher in comparison with that in non-treatment and sham control groups (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the volume of blood clot around the BA was reduced significantly in D(2)O-treatment groups, compared with those in both the non-treatment and the sham control groups (p < 0.05). Histological examination showed that the BA represented less folding of the internal elastic lumina in D(2)O-treatment groups, while a corrugation of the intima with the thickened vessel wall was seen in both the non-treatment and sham control groups. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic administration of D(2)O into the cisterna magna exhibited an inhibitory effect on CVS after SAH in rabbits.
