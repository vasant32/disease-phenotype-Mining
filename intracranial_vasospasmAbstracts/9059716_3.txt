Calponin, an actin- and tropomyosin-binding protein, has been characterized as an inhibitory factor in the smooth-muscle actomyosin activity. The level of calponin was determined in canine basilar arteries in a double-haemorrhage model. Thirty dogs were assigned to three groups: day 0 group, control; day 2 group, dogs sacrificed 2 days after cisternal injection of blood; and day 7 group, dogs given double cisternal injections of blood and sacrificed 7 days after the first injection. Constriction of the basilar artery was confirmed by arterial angiography. Portions of the affected arteries or the corresponding region in control animals were solubilized for sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. A major band corresponding to calponin was seen at 34 kD in the basilar artery extracts using chicken gizzard polyclonal antibodies. The densitometer values of the band on Coomassie blue-stained gels were expressed as percentages of day 0 control values. The signals of day 2 and day 7 samples were 47% +/- 20% and 23% +/- 12%, respectively (mean +/- standard deviation). The proportions of calponin to actin/tropomyosin in the day 0, day 2, and day 7 groups were 13% +/- 6%, 6% +/- 2%, and 4% +/- 2%, respectively. The reduced expression of calponin may be related to sustained contraction during cerebral vasospasm.
