OBJECTIVE: To explore the curative effect of combining exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with small dose of urokinase injection for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: One hundred thirty-four SAH patients diagnosed by CT or MRI and lumbar puncture were randomly divided into two groups: 68 patients in the treatment group were given exchange of cerebrospinal fluid and small dose of urokinase injection; 66 patients in the control group were treated with exchange of cerebrospinal fluid. The main complications, the neurological deficit scale and curative effect of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: Complications about cerebral vasospasm and hydrocephalus were fewer than those in the conventional therapeutic group (P < 0.05), and there was no significant difference in the incidence of rebleeding between the two groups (P > 0.05). The neurological deficit scale in the treatment-group was significantly lower than that in conventional therapeutic group (P < 0.01). There was obvious difference the curative effect in the two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Combining exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with small dose of urokinase injection is an effective method for treating SAH, and it can improve the survival rate and life quality of SAH patients.
