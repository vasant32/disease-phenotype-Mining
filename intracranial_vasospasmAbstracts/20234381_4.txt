Cerebral vasospasm determines the prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The increased vascular reactiveness has an important role in the development of cerebral vasospasm. This study analyzed the roles of the receptor-mediated signaling and the myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity in the increased vascular reactiveness in SAH, using the basilar artery of a rabbit SAH model. Endothelin-1, thrombin, and phenylephrine induced transient increases in [Ca(2+)](i), myosin light chain phosphorylation, and contraction in the controls. All these responses were not only enhanced but also became sustained in SAH. In the sequential stimulation of thrombin receptor or alpha(1)-adrenoceptor, the second response was substantially attenuated in the controls, whereas it was maintained in SAH. The thrombin-induced contraction in SAH irreversibly persisted even after terminating the thrombin stimulation. This contraction was completely reversed by trypsin and a Galpha(q) inhibitor YM254890, thus suggesting the sustained receptor activity during the sustained contraction. YM254890 also inhibited the endothelin-1- and phenylephrine-induced sustained contraction. Furthermore, the GTPgammaS-induced transient contraction in the control alpha-toxin-permeabilized strips was converted to a sustained contraction in SAH. The results provide the first evidence that the feedback inactivation of the receptor activity and the myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity was impaired in SAH, thus contributing to the increased vascular reactiveness.
