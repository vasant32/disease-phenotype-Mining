A canine model of cerebral vasospasm using noncellular blood material (fibrin glue) was designed to investigate the effect of cerebrospinal fluid obstruction. The arachnoid membrane covering the cerebral arteries in the basal cistern was dissected and fibrin glue was applied to the adventitial surface of the arteries in three groups of animals. In Group 1, the arachnoid membrane was extensively dissected and fibrin glue was widely applied to the cerebral arteries. In Group 2, the dissection and coating was less extensive. Group 3 was a control group in which the arachnoid membrane was dissected but fibrin glue was not applied. Cerebral angiography 1 week later clearly demonstrated vasospasm in all six dogs in Group 1 and in four of six dogs in Group 2. Vasospasm did not occur in Group 3. The dogs were sacrificed and the arteries in the basal cistern were removed. Histological investigation showed typical findings of vasospasm and inertness of fibrin glue to the tissue. Cerebral vasospasm can be induced by a noncellular material from the blood densely applied to the arterial surface suggesting that obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid circulation around the artery may be important in the development of cerebral vasospasm.
