Typically occurring between 3 days and 3 weeks post-hemorrhage, cerebral vasospasm in the acute stage after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality associated with patient outcomes, despite advances in aneurysm treatment and vasospasm management. Though incompletely understood, cerebral vasospasm is well described in the immediate post-hemorrhage patient. Less detailed descriptions exist of delayed or progressive restenosis after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and resultant vasospasm. We report a case of delayed progressive supraclinoid internal carotid artery restenosis treated with angioplasty 10 weeks after initial hemorrhage.
