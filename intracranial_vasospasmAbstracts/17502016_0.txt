OBJECTIVE: To discuss the early diagnostic methods and therapeutic principles of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy objectively. METHODS: Using neuro-imaging examinations combined with case history and clinical symptoms to make the early diagnosis of 96 case with aneurysmal SAH, and Guglielmi detachable microcoil (GDC) was utilized for early intracapsular embolization in the ruptured aneurysms. Efficient symptomatic treatment was done early after operation. RESULTS: All of 96 cases were early diagnosed and successfully embolized; Among them, the aneurysmal lumen was 100% occluded in 83 cases, 95% in 8 cases, 90% in 5 cases. There were 3 cases complicating with aneurysms rupture during operation, 5 cases with cerebral vasospasm. One case was affected by microcoil terminal escape after operation, 3 recurrent cases were all cured with secondary GDC embolization. There were 9 complications associated with embolization techniques and 13 cases (13.5%) occurring permanent sequelae associated with SAH. According to the Glasgow prognosis score, 77 patients got grade I, 7 grade II, 6 grade III, 3 grade IV, and 3 grade V. The mortality rate was 3.1%. CONCLUSIONS: To make early etiological diagnosis of the SAH patients, using GDC to embolize the aneurysms, and earlier efficient symptomatic treatment are important methods to improve the curative rate and reduce the mortality rate.
