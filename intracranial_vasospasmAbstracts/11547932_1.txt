It has become increasingly evident that the pathophysiology of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) which described the ischemic consequences of cerebral arterial constriction is complex and multifactorial. In an attempt to study cerebral vasospasm, numerous investigators have used experimental animal models that resemble cerebral vasospasm in humans. No ideal model for SAH has been found as yet, and hence the quest for such a model continues. We developed an endoscopic technique that permits a direct vision of internal carotid artery and puncturing the artery to provoke SAH. This model will closely reflect the clinical setting of an aneurysm rupture. The onset of SAH was characterized by a sudden decrease of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) by at least 40% in the first 20 min. Following this initial drop, there was an increase in the CBF and the CBV, however, they remained significantly below the base line values, at the end of 1 h. This study describes a new model of SAH in rat that simulates the clinical phenomenon of ruptured intracranial aneurysm that also produces cerebral vasospasm.
