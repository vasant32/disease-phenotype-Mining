Imbalance between the two arachidonic acid metabolites, prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), is thought to be at least in part responsible for the development of cerebral vasospasm following aneurysm rupture. In 12 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage the pre- and postoperative serum and CSF levels of PGI2 and TXA2 were measured as a function of their stable hydrolysis products, 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha (PGI2) and thromboxane B2 (TXA2), with a highly specific radioimmunoassay. Serum levels of both metabolites were elevated in half of the patients, but no correlation to the clinical course could be found. However, TXB2 concentration in the CSF was significantly increased preoperatively with close correlation to the amount of intracisternal blood, as detected by CT scan. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that the postoperative course of the TXB2 concentrations in the CSF reflects the clinical course in such a way that a characteristic secondary rise of TXB2, concentration postoperatively is closely related to the occurrence of cerebral vasospasm and clinical deterioration. The conclusion is drawn that measurement of arachidonic acid metabolites in the CSF may provide important information concerning the pathophysiological events following subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially with regard to incipient cerebral vasospasm.
