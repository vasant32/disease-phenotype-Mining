The levels of two calcium-binding proteins, S-100 protein and calmodulin, were measured serially in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and aneurysm surgery. These two proteins have a similar molecular structure and are highly concentrated in the central nervous system (CNS). The levels of S-100 protein found in the earliest postoperative CSF samples correlated with the preoperative SAH grades. High S-100 protein levels in the CSF were found in patients with poor SAH grades. Moreover, the prognosis of the patients correlated with the S-100 protein levels in the CSF samples taken during the immediate postoperative period and with the daily changes of the S-100 protein levels. Severe diffuse cerebral vasospasm was followed by a sharp S-100 protein increase. These results suggest that S-100 protein levels in the CSF provide a useful index of organic damage in the CNS, and furthermore that S-100 protein levels and their changes may have prognostic value for patients after SAH. On the other hand, there was a lack of correlation between the calmodulin levels and the preoperative grade or outcome. It would be inappropriate, however, to speculate from the results of this study that these calcium-binding proteins in the CSF play any causative role in pathological processes such as cerebral vasospasm or brain ischemia after SAH, since changes in the levels of these proteins followed the onset of clinical signs of deterioration.
