We report the case of a 72-year-old man suffering from posttraumatic subarachnoidal hemorrhage. After recovering from the initial impaired consciousness and posttraumatic psychosis the patient deteriorated again 7 days after the accident. Cerebral vasospasm was found to be the underlying cause. So far few publications have drawn attention to posttraumatic vasospasm, though this is also interesting from the aspect of treatment.
