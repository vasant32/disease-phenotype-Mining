The aim of this study was to evaluate the following questions: Can the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-AB) be identified in the serum and cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) of dogs? Is there an increase in the concentration of PDGF-AB following experimental subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)? Is the increase in concentration related to the angiographic cerebral vasospasm of the basilar artery. The "double haemorrhage" model was applied in seven dogs to produce experimental SAH with determination of angiographic vasospasm in the basilar artery. Blood and CSF samples were taken on the first, third and eighth days. The analyses were performed with an ELISA human PDGF-AB antibody kit (quantikine human PDGF-AB, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). The average PDGF-AB base value in the serum on the day before the SAH was 410.77 +/- 177.56 pg/ml, in the CSF it was 6.43 +/- 3.19 pg/ml. There was a significant (p = 0.05) increase in the concentration of PDGF-AB (third day 717.35 pg/ml, eighth day 918.07 pg/ml) in the serum of all animals. No significant increase was found in the CSF samples of any animal. In summary, a PDGF-AB like immune reactivity was found in the serum of dogs with the human PDGF-AB ELISA kit and the concentration of PDGF-AB in the serum increased after experimental SAH but not in CSF, but there was no relationship between the increase in PDGF-AB serum concentration and angiographic vasospasm.
