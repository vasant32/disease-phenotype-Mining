Serial evaluation of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage was attempted in 11 patients using magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. MR angiography demonstrated vasospasm with angiographic confirmation in three patients as a segmental narrowing or loss of flow signal, usually accompanied by decreased distal flow signal. MR angiography also showed decreased flow signal suggestive of vasospasm in another patient with clinical evidence of vasospasm but no angiographic confirmation was possible because of poor condition. MR angiography showed no vasospasm in five patients without clinical evidence of vasospasm, except in one patient with disappearance of the unilateral anterior cerebral artery signal, shown to be involvement of the clipped artery. MR angiography is a potential method for detection of vasospasm with further improvement of the technique.
