Apolipoprotein E (apoE), the major apolipoprotein in the central nervous system, has been shown to influence neurologic disease progression and response to neurologic injury in a gene-specific manner. Presence of the APOE4 allele is associated with poorer response to traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke, but the association between APOE genotype and outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains unclear. The purpose of this project was to investigate the association between APOE genotype and outcome after SAH. We also explored the association of APOE4 genotype and cerebral vasospasm (CV) presence in a subsample of our population with available angiographic data. A sample of 206 aneurysmal SAH participants had APOE genotyping performed, Glasgow outcome scores (GOS) and modified Rankin scores (MRS) collected at 3 and 6 months after aneurysm rupture. No significant association was found between the presence of the APOE4 genotype and functional outcomes controlling for age, race, size of hemorrhage (Fisher grade), and severity of injury (Hunt & Hess grade). However when controlling for CV and the covariates listed above, individuals with the APOE4 allele had worse functional outcomes at both time points. The presence of the APOE2 allele was not associated with functional outcomes even when considering presence of CV. There was no difference in mortality associated with APOE4 presence, APOE2 presence, or presence of CV. These findings suggest APOE4 allele is associated with poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH.
