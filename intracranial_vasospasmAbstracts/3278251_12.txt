To determine whether cerebral arteries in spasm have an altered capacity to synthesize the vasoactive substances prostacyclin and thromboxane A2, we measured levels of these arachidonic acid metabolites using a primate model of vasospasm. Twenty-four cynomolgus monkeys were assigned at random to one of three groups designated sham, clot, or clot-removal. All animals underwent base line cerebral angiography and bilateral dissection of the major cerebral arteries from the arachnoid. The clot and clot-removal groups had autologous hematomas placed around the vessels to simulate subarachnoid hemorrhages. The sham group had a similar volume of saline instilled into the subarachnoid space. Twenty-four hours later, the clot-removal group underwent a second craniotomy to remove the hematomas. Seven days after the initial operation, angiography was repeated on all animals. The animals were then killed, and the cerebral arteries were removed. Basal levels of prostacyclin and thromboxane in the cerebral vessels were measured after incubation in vitro by radioimmunoassay. No detectable leukotriene C4 release by these arteries was measurable using radioimmunoassay. Angiography revealed severe cerebral vasospasm in the clot group, but not in the clot-removal or sham groups. There were no statistical differences among the groups in thromboxane release, but prostacyclin levels were significantly lower in the clot group than in the clot-removal group (P less than 0.05). It thus seems that, if an imbalance in constrictor and dilator eicosanoids occurs in association with vasospasm, this is more likely to arise from a relative lack of the vasodilator component prostacyclin than from a surplus of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
