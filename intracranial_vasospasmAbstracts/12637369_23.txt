Although there is evidence that the Rho/Rho kinase pathway and protein kinase C (PKC) are involved in the development of cerebral vasospasm, the mechanism by which subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) activates these pathways is unclear. A large body of evidence points to oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) as a major causative component of blood clot responsible for vasospasm. Therefore, the present studies were conducted to explore whether the Rho/Rho kinase and PKC may be involved in a sustained vasoconstriction induced by OxyHb in cerebral arteries. OxyHb evoked sustained vasoconstriction in the endothelium-denuded rabbit basilar arteries, which was reversed by the selective inhibitors of Rho kinase, Y-27632, and HA-1077, with the IC50 values of 0.26+/-0.02 and 0.74+/-0.1 micromol/L, respectively. In quiescent cerebrovascular smooth muscle (CVSM) cells, OxyHb induced Rho translocation, as assessed by immunoblotting, with a time course, which paralleled the contractile action of OxyHb. Rho translocation was also observed in intact arteries stimulated with OxyHb for 24 hours (219%) and 48 hours (160%). The increase in Rho translocation was fully inhibited by GGTI-297, an inhibitor of Rho prenylation. OxyHb also caused significant translocation of both PKCalpha and PKCepsilon (P<0.01), which was maximal at the time corresponding to maximal tension developed in response to OxyHb. Ro-32-0432, an inhibitor of PKC, attenuated vasoconstriction mediated by OxyHb in basilar artery. These results show, for the first time, that OxyHb-mediated signaling in CVSM utilizes the Rho/Rho kinase and PKC-based mechanisms.
