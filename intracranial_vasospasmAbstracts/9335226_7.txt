To determine the pathogenetic mechanism underlying the maintenance of arterial narrowing during the chronic phase of cerebral vasospasm caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), we examined the effect of ozagrel, a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthetase inhibitor, on chronic vasospasm in a canine two-hemorrhage model in comparison with that of fasudil, an inhibitor of protein kinases. The magnitude of the vasospasm was determined angiographically. On SAH day 7, a vasospasm was observed in every dog. Intraarterial or intravenous administration of ozagrel (3 mg/kg/30 min) did not reverse the vasospasm but tended to increase bleeding. In contrast, intraarterial administration of fasudil (3 mg/kg/30 min) significantly reversed the vasospasm. These findings suggest that: 1) TXA2 does not participate in the maintenance of chronic vasospasm after SAH; and 2) the protein kinases, particularly myosin-light chain kinase and protein kinase C, are involved in the pathogenesis of arterial narrowing during the chronic phase of cerebral vasospasm.
