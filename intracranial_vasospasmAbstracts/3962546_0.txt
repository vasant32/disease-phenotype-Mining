The results of surgery for arterial aneurysms of the brain are analysed. It was found that the severity of the patient's condition rather than the time of the operation had an effect on the outcome of surgery. The severity of the patient's condition and the outcome of the operation were determined first of all by the presence of the intracranial hematoma, cerebrovascular spasm, escape of blood into the ventricles of the brain, and the degree of manifestation of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The advantage of early operations for the prevention of repeated ruptures of the aneurysm is pointed out.
