A new stable analogue of prostacyclin, iloprost, was tested on the basilar artery of anaesthetized rabbits constricted by electrical stimulation and intracisternal injection of autologous blood. The vasospasm induced by these stimuli was effectively relieved (about 100%) by topical application of iloprost, a stable analogue of prostacyclin (PGI2), and no constriction occurred on further stimulation within one hour. The mechanisms of the action of iloprost and its possible therapeutic value in subarachnoid haemorrhage are discussed.
