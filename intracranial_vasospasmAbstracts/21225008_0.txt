Cerebral salt wasting (CSW) frequently occurs concomitantly with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). CSW induces excessive natriuresis and osmotic diuresis, reduces total blood volume, aggravates cerebral vasospasm and causes cerebral ischemia after SAH. This study examined the inhibitory effect of hydrocortisone on CSW in rat SAH models. Hydrocortisone had an inhibitory effect on CSW because hydrocortisone functioned in a dose-dependent manner to inhibit the increase in sodium excretion and sodium/potassium ratio after SAH onset. We conclude that hydrocortisone is a useful drug for the treatment of CSW after SAH.
