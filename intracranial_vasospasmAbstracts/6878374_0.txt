It was found that Fluosol-DA 20% relieves human acute cerebral ischemia resulting from vasospasm in 62% of the cases. However, several problems were encountered during the investigation. The efficacy of the solution was temporary, that is, within 24 hours. This is considered logical because perfluorochemical particles are eliminated fairly rapidly from the circulating blood. Successive administrations should be necessary until cerebral vasospasm is remitted. Another problem is that it is not clear whether the doses of the solution given in this study (10 ml/kg/day) are sufficient or not, since the depth of the cerebral ischemia is considered to vary depending on the case. It might be necessary to change the volume of the solution given in accordance with the depth of the ischemia of each patient.
