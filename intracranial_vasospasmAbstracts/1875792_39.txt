There is increasing evidence that the conversion of big endothelin-1 (big ET-1) to endothelin-1 (ET-1) is specifically inhibited by the metalloproteinase inhibitor phosphoramidon. We investigated the effect of phosphoramidon on delayed cerebral vasospasm from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using a two-hemorrhage canine model. The magnitude of the vasospasm and the drug effect were determined angiographically. On SAH Day 7, diameter of the basilar artery decreased to about 55% of the control value obtained before SAH (on Day 0). Immunoreactive ET (IR-ET) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) significantly increased after SAH (on Day 7). The intracisternal pretreatment of phosphoramidon potently suppressed the decrease in diameter of the basilar artery after SAH, i.e., observed decrease was only about 20%, compared with the value before SAH. In the phosphoramidon group, IR-ET in CSF markedly increased (on SAH Day 2), but the increased levels of IR-ET significantly declined on SAH Day 7. These results clearly indicate that phosphoramidon effectively prevents delayed cerebral vasospasm. Whether the prevention is due to the inhibition of conversion of big ET-1 to ET-1 is now under study.
