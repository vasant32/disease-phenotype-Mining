Thirty-one cases of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage were treated with intraarterial papaverine infusion. Symptomatic cases were nineteen, and asymptomatic cases were twelve. Papaverine (120 mg/saline 50 ml, 30 min) was injected superselectively to vasospastic vessels through a microcatheter. The rate of symptomatically improved cases was 63% initially, but about two thirds of those cases had recurrence within a day. The 63% of symptomatic cases showed infarction in spite of papaverine infusion. Three cases of recurrent vasospasm after intra-arterial papaverine underwent PTA and showed good dilatation of vasospastic vessels. The complications of our intra-arterial papaverine were hypotension in two cases, convulsion in one case and transient disturbed consciousness in one case. We experienced no fatal complications. Overall outcome was ADL1 (19%), ADL2 (25%), ADL3 (44%), ADL4 (0%), ADL5 (6%), and death (6%). Since the effect of intra-arterial papaverine infusion is of short duration and weak, combination of PTA and papaverine may be necessary. It is recommended to use papaverine for vasospasm in distal arteries such as M2, A1, A2, and to carry out PTA for proximal arteries such as ICA and M1.
