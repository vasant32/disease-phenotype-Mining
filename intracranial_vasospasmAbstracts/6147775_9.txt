Five patients with severe head injury, rating between 3 and 5 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, were treated with the calciumchannel blocker nimodipine continuously for up to 12 days (2 mg/h) because of severe spasm of cerebral arteries. All cases involved the intracranial carotid artery and the first segments of the medial and anterior cerebral arteries. Control angiograms performed in 4 cases showed improved or normalized vessel calibre after the treatment. Intracranial pressure as well as blood pressure were not altered during nimodipine treatment. EEG improved within 7 days after treatment in all cases. Repeated CT scans showed reduction of cerebral edema. Hypothalamic disorders observed in 3 cases were stabilized. Based on these preliminary results, calciumchannel blocker reverses traumatic vasospasm and ameliorates physiologic function of the brain structures after severe head injury.
