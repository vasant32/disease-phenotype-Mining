In the case of clinically evident subarachnoid hemorrhage it is possible for additional complications in the form of cerebrovascular spasms to mask the source of hemorrhage. And if the spasms basally affect all of the cerebral arteries, then the probable site of hemorrhage cannot be concluded from the location of spastic vasoconstrictions. Therfore, it is necessary that all regions of the brain be angiographed during repeated examinations. Being the cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage, infrequently occuring small-size arteriovenous angiomata of the posterior cranial fossa [6,3,5] sometimes cannot be located accurately by methods other than angiotomography.
