Levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in the basilar artery and in circulating blood of cats were determined after the production of spasm by topical application of blood to the vessel and following treatment with agents known to alter cyclic AMP. Isoproterenol, known to stimulate adenyl cyclase, and aminophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, were studied alone and in combination. Cyclic AMP of the basilar artery fell from a mean control value of 43 to 26 pmoles per milligram of protein following the production of vasospasm. Intravenous administration of isoproterenol alone and in combination with aminophylline produced dilatation of the basilar artery, which was associated with a marked rise in the cyclic AMP concentration in the vessel. The finding that cerebral vasospasm is associated with a fall and vasodilation with a rise in cyclic AMP concentration supports the hypothesis of an active role for cyclic nucleotides in the regulation of cerebrovascular smooth muscle tone.
