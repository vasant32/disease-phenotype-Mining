To our knowledge, the use of transdermal nitroglycerin ointment (Nitropaste) in the setting of intracranial vasospasm has not been described in the peer-reviewed literature. Five patients with intracranial vasospasm induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage were evaluated angiographically both before and after application of Nitropaste. All cases exhibited mild to moderate improvement in the degree of vasospasm. We conclude that Nitropaste is a simple noninvasive technique to reduce intracranial vasospasm.
