OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of mild hypothermia treatment in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who are experiencing intracranial hypertension and/or cerebral vasospasm (CVS). METHODS: Of 441 consecutive patients with SAH, 100 developed elevated intracranial pressure and/or symptomatic CVS refractory to conventional treatment. Hypothermia (33-34 degrees C) was induced and maintained until intracranial pressure normalized, CVS resolved, or severe side effects occurred. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were treated with hypothermia alone, and 87 were treated with hypothermia in combination with barbiturate coma. Sixty-six patients experienced poor-grade SAH (Hunt and Hess Grades IV and V) and 92 had Fisher Grade 3 and 4 bleedings. The mean duration of hypothermia was 169 +/- 104 hours, with a maximum of 16.4 days. The outcome after 1 year was evaluated in 90 of 100 patients. Thirty-two patients (35.6%) survived with good functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score, 4 and 5), 14 (15.5%) were severely disabled (GOS score, 3), 1 (1.1%) was in a vegetative state (GOS score, 2), and 43 (47.8%) died (GOS score, 1). The most frequent side effects were electrolyte disorders (77%), pneumonia (52%), thrombocytopenia (47%), and septic shock syndrome (40%). Of 93 patients with severe side effects, 6 (6.5%) died as a result of respiratory or multi-organ failure. CONCLUSION: Prolonged systemic hypothermia may be considered as a last-resort option for a carefully selected group of SAH patients with intracranial hypertension or CVS resistant to conventional treatment. However, complications associated with hypothermia require elaborate protocols in general intensive care unit management.
