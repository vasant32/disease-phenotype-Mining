OBJECT: Natriuresis is a common systemic manifestation of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Natriuresis and its accompanying hypovolemia may be a major contributing factor in the pathophysiology of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm. METHODS: The authors studied 14 consecutive patients with aneurysmal SAH and compared levels of adrenomedullin (ADM), a novel endogenous natriuretic peptide that possesses additional profound vasodilatory properties, with the natriuretic peptide system by using radioimmunoassay. The mean ADM values on admission were 24.8 pg/ml, a twofold increase over control values, but no correlation was found with atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-natriuretic peptide (CNP) from the natriuretic peptide system. At Day 5 post-SAH, ADM levels were significantly elevated in patients with vasospasm documented angiographically or on transcranial Doppler studies as compared with those who suffered no vasospasm (mean 61.9 pg/ml compared with 15.3 pg/ml, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that an elevation of ADM in plasma may indicate a physiological regulatory attempt to induce cerebral vasodilation. The regulation of ADM is uncoupled from ANP, BNP, and CNP.
