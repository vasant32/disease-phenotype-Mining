A non-traumatic approach to the subarachnoid space near the circle of Willis is demonstrated in this study. The approach is made between the olfactory bulb and frontal lobe. Following perfusion with Evans blue dye no leakage was observed into the parenchyma indicating no tissue damage had occurred. No gross bleeding or cerebral vasospasm was visible in the middle meningeal artery (dural), the surface pial blood vessels and the vessels of the circle of Willis. In conclusion, this technique can be successfully used for studies on experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage simulated on the ventral aspect of the brain near the circle of Willis without causing technique-associated cerebrovascular and parenchymal injury.
