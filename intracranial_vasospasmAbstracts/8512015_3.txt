A double-isotope autoradiography technique was used to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglu) during the late phase of vasospasm in a squirrel monkey subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) model. Cisternal blood injections induced both global and focal changes in CBF and CMRglu six days following SAH, the timepoint of maximal late spasm in this model. There was a global decrease in CBF of about 30% accompanied by an increase in deoxyglucose uptake of about 50%. Four of seven animals also had foci with flow decreased to 40% of control and deoxyglucose uptake increased to 300% of control. There was an altered but still present interdependence between flow and metabolism post SAH.
