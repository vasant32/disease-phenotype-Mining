1. Experimental chronic cerebral vasospasm induced by subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) in rabbits was studied in order to evaluate the efficacy of repeated i.v. infusion of Iloprost (ILO). 2. The mean diameter of the basilar artery of intact animals was calculated as 737.5 +/- 52.8 microns while this value was reduced to 237.5 +/- 22.96 microns after SAH. 3. In the ILO treated group the mean diameter of the basilar artery was significantly increased and found to be 593.75 +/- 64.0 microns. 4. No change was observed in intracranial pressure (ICP) except a slight decrease in mean arterial pressure when relatively higher doses of ILO were used. 5. These results were taken as evidence of the high therapeutic value and low side effects of ILO in the treatment of persisting cerebral vasospasm due to SAH.
