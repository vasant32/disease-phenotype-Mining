A model for producing chronic cerebral vasospasm in monkeys by injecting autologous blood into the basal cistern is described. Spasm/narrowing was observed by angiography one hour after SAH in 8 out of 10 monkeys and in 5 of these 8, spasm was observed both one and two weeks later. No narrowing of the vessels was observed in the control cases. In monkeys that showed spasm one week after SAH, narrowing of the extracranial vertebral arteries was also observed. Repeated injections of blood at intervals of one and two weeks caused intensification of spasm in the intracranial portion of vertebral arteries and the basilar arteries. It is suggested that cerebral vasospasm following SAH may in part be mediated by a central control mechanism acting through the sympathetic nervous system in that extracranial vessels remote from direct contact with blood showed reactive narrowing.
