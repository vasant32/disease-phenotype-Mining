Severe chronic cerebral vasospasm was produced in dog basilar arteries by two injections, 2 days apart, of autologous blood into the cisterna magna of 25 dogs. Treatment with ibuprofen (n = 8) or high-dose methylprednisolone (n = 8) after the first injection of blood prevented or reduced angiographic vasospasm. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2 alpha, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (a metabolite of prostacyclin), and thromboxane B2 (a metabolite of thromboxane A2) were measured in both treated and untreated (n = 7) dogs. In untreated dogs, the level of prostaglandin E2 increased 94-fold by Day 8 after the first injection of blood and was strongly and positively correlated with the degree of angiographic vasospasm. Treatment with ibuprofen and high-dose methylprednisolone prevented or significantly reduced this increase in prostaglandin E2 concentration. Smaller increases in cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of thromboxane B2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha occurred after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage; the magnitude of these increases was also reduced by ibuprofen or high-dose methylprednisolone treatment. In contrast, prostaglandin F2 alpha levels were not significantly altered during the study. These data show that enhanced prostaglandin E2 synthesis occurs during experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the by-products generated in its synthesis may play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.
