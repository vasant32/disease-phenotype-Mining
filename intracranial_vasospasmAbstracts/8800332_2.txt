Sixteen patients (6 women, 10 men; mean age: 52.5 years) suffering from spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) of unknown origin underwent a protocol of initial and then weekly computed tomography (CT), initial four-vessel digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and at least one control pancerebral DSA. Fourteen patients had magnetic resonance imaging before undergoing first control DSA. All patients had calcium-antagonists (Nimodipine) via a central venous catheter, were kept on the neurosurgical intensive care unit and followed daily with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). One patient (6.3%) developed moderate and 5 (31.1%) developed severe cerebral vasospasm as documented with TCD and exhibited deterioration of their level of consciousness. These 6 patients were treated with induced hypertension, hypervolaemia and haemodilution. Their blood flow velocities were elevated for a mean of 8 (5-17) days with a peak after 12.5 (9-17) days following SAH. No complications due to treatment were noted. One patient of the non-vasospastic group died of pulmonary embolism, another patient had an ischaemic incident during angiography, which has led to permanent disability. On follow-up 2-24 months after SAH 14 patients had returned to their premorbid state. It is concluded that patients suffering from SAH of unknown origin should undergo repeated angiographic investigation and subsequent daily monitoring of their neurologic status including daily TCD recordings so that haemodynamic treatment can be established in the event of cerebral vasospasm, which may occur in up to one third of these patients.
