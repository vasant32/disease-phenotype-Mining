It is suggested that endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor peptide, is involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We examined the effects of intracisternal administration of big ET-1 on the cerebral arteries in the absence or presence of pretreatment with phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of ET converting enzyme, in anesthetized dogs. After intracisternal administration of big ET-1 (10 micrograms/dog), the caliber of the basilar artery on the angiogram was decreased to about 59% of the control. This was accompanied by a marked increase in immunoreactive ET in the cerebrospinal fluid. Systemic arterial pressure was markedly elevated following big ET-1 injection. All changes induced by big ET-1 were effectively prevented with phosphoramidon. These data suggest that intracisternally administered big ET-1 is converted to ET-1 and that the generated ET-1 produces cerebral vasospasm and hypertension. A phosphoramidon-sensitive metalloproteinase appears to contribute to this conversion.
