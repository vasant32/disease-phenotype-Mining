BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been postulated to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of SAH and subsequent cerebral vasospasm. The inhibitory effect of CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) on the induction of iNOS after SAH was examined by using transgenic mice overexpressing CuZn-SOD. METHODS: SOD-transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermates were subjected to SAH by endovascular perforation of the left anterior cerebral artery. The iNOS mRNA expression after SAH was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the distribution of iNOS-positive cells was immunohistochemically examined. The nuclear expression of activated nuclear factor-kappaB, a major transcription factor of iNOS gene, was also immunohistochemically examined. RESULTS: In nontransgenic mice, SAH-induced iNOS protein and mRNA expressions in the arteries of basal cistern as well as in the cerebral cortex were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. SAH-induced iNOS protein and mRNA expressions in those tissues were much reduced in SOD-transgenic mice compared with nontransgenic mice. Moreover, the nuclear expression of the activated form of nuclear factor-kappaB was immunohistochemically detected in the cerebral cortices of nontransgenic mice but not in those of SOD-transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that oxygen-derived free radicals, particularly superoxide, play an important role in the iNOS gene expression after SAH and provide a molecular basis for the protective role of SOD against vasospasm after SAH.
