In order to investigate the efficacy mechanism of Nao Yi-an(NYA) granule on acute cerebral hemorrhage(ACH), 38 cases of ACH were treated with NYA granule(NYA group) or with Western Medicine (WM group). The contents of their plasmal NE, E, and DA before and after treatments were observed. The results showed that the contents of the plasmal NE, E and DA increase remarkably, compared with those of normal control group(P < 0.01), and accompanied by the increase of volume of hemorrhage or the gravity of the disease. After treatment, the contents of the plasmal NE, E and DA in NYA group are notably lower than those before the treatment(P < 0.01), but in WM group, they are not significantly lower than those before the treatment(P > 0.05), and they are strikingly lower in NYA group than in WM group. It is indicated that the NYA group can effectively decrease the contents of plasmal NE, E and DA, to remove cerebrovascular spasm, to relieve cerebral edema, to improve microcirculation of brain tissue, to increase blood and energy supplies, anticerebral secondary ischemia and hypoxia and improve the clinical effects.
