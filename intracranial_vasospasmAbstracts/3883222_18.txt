Histological, histochemical, and histoimmunological studies were conducted on cerebral arteries from three living patients with a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. There seemed to be a correlation between the severity of vasospasm and the magnitude of pathological alterations. Myofibroblasts and Type V collagen within the medial layer were abundant in vessels showing marked constriction, but were less conspicuous in those arteries showing milder involvement. Intracranial arteries from patients who died from noncerebral causes did not demonstrate these changes. Thus, myofibroblasts and Type V collagen may be related to cerebral vasospasm by holding the damaged vessel in a contracted phase for weeks during the healing period.
