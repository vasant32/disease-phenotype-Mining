Animal models provide a basis for clarifying the complex pathogenesis of delayed cerebral vasospasm (DVCS) and for screening of potential therapeutic approaches. The aim of this work was to identify and analyze the most consistent and feasible models and their characteristics for each animal. An online search of the MEDLINE PubMed and EMBASE medical databases (1969 to week 21 of 2007) was performed using the key words "mice", "rat", "rabbit", "canine", and "primate" in combination with "subarachnoid hemorrhage", "model", and "vasospasm". Seven techniques were mainly used to induce experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in closed and open cranium approaches. Among the great number of experimental SAH methods and associated parameters only a fistful reliable models can be identified and recommended for experimental work in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and nonhuman primates.
