 AIM: To investigate the correlation between angiographic cerebral circulation time (CCT) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) evaluated by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) before and after endovascular treatment for symptomatic vasospasm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with unilateral vasospasm as demonstrated by catheter angiography who underwent pre- and post-treatment SPECT were selected. All patients had angiographic vasospasm of unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA). Eight vessels in seven patients underwent intra-arterial papaverine infusion and three vessels underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Angiographic CCT was defined as the interval from the first image in which contrast medium was visible at the origin of MCA to its disappearance from the cortical arteries in the MCA territory. In SPECT studies, the ischaemic degree in MCA territory was analysed by side to side comparison with calculating the asymmetry index (AI). RESULTS: The pre-treatment mean CCT was 4.1 +/- 0.8 s. The mean CCT immediately after treatment was 2.7 +/- 0.5 s. In the control subjects (n = 15) with unruptured aneurysm, mean CCT was 3.5 +/- 0.2 s. The pre-treatment mean CCT was significantly prolonged compared with that in the control subjects (P = 0.02). The post-treatment mean CCT was significantly shortened compared with that in the control subjects (P = 0.001). The pre-treatment mean AI was 71.2 +/- 7.4%, and that immediately after treatment was 90.5 +/- 3.6%. AI increased in all territories treated with endovascular treatment; the mean change was 19.3%. Angiographic CCT was closely correlated with AI in both pre- (r = - 0.95) and post-treatment (r = - 0.79). CONCLUSION: Measurement of CCT is useful in evaluating cerebral haemodynamics of endovascular treatments in patients with cerebral vasospasm.
