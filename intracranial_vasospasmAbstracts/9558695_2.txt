It is well known that some patients with neurally mediated syncope have a feeling of aura before the onset of syncope. A case is reported in which cerebral dysfunction recorded by EEG was present before the onset of a vasovagal reaction. The vasovagal reaction, bradycardia and/or asystole, was preceded by abnormal EEG findings when the patient complained of feeling a headache, photophobia, and nausea. These findings suggest that cerebral hypoperfusion, such as with cerebral vasospasms, before the onset of bradycardia might be involved in the mechanism of neurally mediated syncope in patients with an aura.
