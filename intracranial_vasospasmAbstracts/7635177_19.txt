To investigate the roles of endothelin and nitric oxide (NO) in the regulation of cerebral vascular tone under basal conditions and in cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage in dogs, we used BQ-123 (cyclo(-D-Trp-D-Asp-L-Pro-D-Val-L-Leu-) sodium salt), an endothelin ETA receptor antagonist, L-arginine, a substrate for the formation of NO, and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an NO synthesis inhibitor, and measured the angiographic diameter of the basilar artery in vivo. In normal dogs, intracisternal (i.c.) injection of BQ-123 (0.6 mg/kg) produced a 29.4 +/- 6.11% (P < 0.01) increase in the basal diameter 24 h after injection. NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (0.6 mg/kg i.c.) produced a 19.3 +/- 2.93% (P < 0.05) decrease in the basal diameter 2 h after injection. This decrease was significantly attenuated by both BQ-123 (0.06-0.6 mg/kg i.c.) and L-arginine (6 mg/kg i.c.), but not by D-arginine. In the two-hemorrhage canine model, BQ-123 significantly inhibited the development of cerebral vasospasm (36.9 +/- 4.11% decrease on day 5 and 42.0 +/- 4.54% decrease on day 6 in controls vs 21.7 +/- 4.75% decrease (P < 0.05) on day 5 and 20.8 +/- 4.14% decrease (P < 0.05) on day 6 for 0.6 mg/kg i.c.) significantly attenuated the cerebral vasospasm on day 4 from a mg/kg i.c.). Furthermore, in this model, L-arginine (6 30.9 +/- 5.78% decrease (before)) to a 12.6 +/- 5.99% decrease (after). The immunoreactive endothelin-1 levels in the endothelial layer and the adventitia of the basilar artery were much higher on days 3 and 7 after the injection of autologous blood than on day 0 before blood injection. These results suggest that endogenous endothelin and NO both participate in regulating the basal tone of cerebral arteries, and, therefore, the development of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage may be at least partially attributed to an impairment of the balanced action of endothelin and NO. Furthermore, endothelin ETA antagonists or NO products may be useful in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.
