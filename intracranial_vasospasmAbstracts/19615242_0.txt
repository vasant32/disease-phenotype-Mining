OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of urinary kallidinogenase on subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in rabbits. METHODS: Rabbits symptomatic cerebral vasospasm model was built though Endo method, among the 40 rabbits, 8 died or had severe nervous system syndrome, the other 32 were randomly divided into 4 groups:group A, control group, injection of normal saline to the cisterna magna;group B, subarachnoid hemorrhage;group C, injection of human urinary tissue kallikreins;group D, treated with Nimodipine. The behavior scores, neurological scores and cerebral angiography changes were observed. RESULTS: Food intake obviously decreased and neurological deficit were seen in group B, while which were attenuated in group C and group D, and group A was normal. Comparing the diameter of basilar artery was (1.9 +/- 0.3) mm before SAH, the diameter of group B 4 d later was (1.5 +/- 0.3) mm, 7 d later (1.4 +/- 0.3) mm, the difference was significant (P < 0.05). Comparing with group C on the day 4th and 7th, the diameters of basilar artery were significantly different (P < 0.001). Comparing with group D on the day 4th, 7th and 14th, there was no obvious improvement. CONCLUSION: Urinary kallidinogenase and Nimodipine can obviously alleviate symptomatic cerebral vasospasm in rabbits remarkably, but the former's effect of attenuating vasospasm is better than that of Nimodipine.
