The effects of interventional endovascular treatment of cerebral vasospasm with balloon angioplasty or papaverine infusion were evaluated by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) in 44 patients whose cerebral vasospasm was refractory to medical management. SPECT revealed blood flow improvements in 42% of patients with papaverine treated vessels and 70% of patients with balloon angioplasty (P=.037). TCD correlated with SPECT in 71% of patients in the papaverine group and 73% of patients in the balloon angioplasty group. TCD showed 93% of segments improved by angioplasty, whereas 43% of segments were improved with papaverine (P<.001). Disagreements were largely represented by patients with TCD velocity improvements in which SPECT blood flow imaging was, unchanged or worsened. Balloon angioplasty seems superior to papaverine infusion for treatment of vasospasm. SPECT and TCD are complementary tests in the evaluation of vasospasm and effect of interventional therapy.
