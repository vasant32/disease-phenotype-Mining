OBJECTIVE: Hydrocephalus, vasospasm, and frontobasal injury are common complications after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from anterior communicating artery aneurysms. Previous studies have suggested that fenestration of the lamina terminalis (FLT) during surgery may be associated with reduced rates of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus and vasospasm. We report 106 patients affected by anterior communicating artery aneurysms and Fisher Grade 3 aneurysmal SAH and the affect of FLT on shunt-dependent hydrocephalus, vasospasm, and frontobasal injury. METHODS: During a 3-year period, 53 patients underwent FLT and 53 did not. We prospectively evaluated admission and discharge clinical grades, hydrocephalus at admission, occurrence of clinical vasospasm, need for interventional vasospasm therapy, frontobasal hypodensity incidence, and permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunting requirement. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 35 months (mean, 17.9 mo). RESULTS: Shunting incidence after aneurysmal SAH with hydrocephalus was 4.25% in patients who underwent FLT and 13.9% in patients who did not (P < 0.001). Clinical cerebral vasospasm occurred in 29.6% of patients who underwent FLT and in 54.7% of patients who did not (P < 0.001). Frontobasal hypodensity was identified postoperatively in 0% of patients who underwent FLT and in 5% of patients who did not. Good outcome was reported in 69.81% of patients who underwent FLT and in 33.96% of patients who did not (P < 0.001). Poor outcome was associated with higher Hunt and Hess grades, need for ventricular drainage, elevated intracranial pressure, and multiple interventional vasospasm therapies. No complications were linked to FLT. CONCLUSION: FLT was associated with statistically significant decreases in shunting rates, incidence of vasospasm, and better outcomes. We recommend its routine use in patients with Fisher Grade 3 anterior communicating artery aneurysmal SAH.
