Using the canine chronic cerebral vasospasm model, we studied the effects of a potent new nonpeptidic endothelin-1 (ET1) receptor antagonist, bosentan (Ro 47-0203, 4-tert-butyl-N-[6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2'-bipyr imidin-4 - yl]-benzenesulfonamide). Endothelin (ET) receptors are composed of the ETA receptors and the ETB receptors; ET1 acts on both of these receptors. Although it has been previously thought that the ETA receptor mediates vasoconstriction, whereas the ETB receptor mediates vasodilation, recent evidence suggests that ETB receptor also contributes to vasoconstriction. Because bosentan is a mixed antagonist that acts on both receptors, its use might indicate whether or not ET is involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm. In this study, beagle dogs received a double injection of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna at 2-day intervals (i.e., on Days 0 and 2). The diameter of the basilar artery (BA) was angiographically examined up to Day 7. A total of 24 dogs were randomly allocated to either the treatment group or the no-treatment group. Eight dogs were treated with 10 mg/kg bosentan by a one-dose injection into a central venous catheter. Bosentan was given twice a day starting immediately after the first subarachnoid hemorrhage for 6 days until Day 5. Sixteen dogs served as controls, with untreated subarachnoid hemorrhage. After the injection of bosetan, blood pressure decreased by about 25 mm Hg for a few minutes and then returned to normal. In the dogs treated with bosentan, the BA spasm on Day 7 was significantly ameliorated compared with the BA spasm in the untreated dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
