The paper deals with the specific features of using Doppler transcranial sonography in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. It describes the advantages and disadvantages of the method for the diagnosis of arterial spasm of various intracranial arteries. A comparison of angiographic and Doppler sonographic findings revealed that the values of the peak systolic velocity of blood flow (r = -0.875, p < 0.0001) are the most informative for the diagnosis of the extent of intracranial arterial lumenal narrowing. Patients with aneurysm ruptures in the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries were found to have a pronounced increase in the blood flow velocity at the site of aneurysm. The intracranial arterial blood flow parameters critical for the development of brain ischemia during cerebral arterial spasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage are specified in the paper.
