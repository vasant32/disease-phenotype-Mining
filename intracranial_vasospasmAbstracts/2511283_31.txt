Chronic cerebral vasospasm was induced in 16 monkeys by direct placement of a clot of autologous blood over the arteries of the circle of Willis on the right side. The middle cerebral arteries (MCA's) on the clot side all showed angiographic vasospasm, which was maximal 7 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Animals were sacrificed at this time and vascular responses to acetylcholine (ACh), histamine, and the calcium ionophore A23187 were studied in MCA rings from the clot (spastic) side and the non-clot (control) side. In control preparations with an intact endothelium, which had been precontracted by prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), histamine and A23187 produced significant relaxation. The same concentrations of histamine and A23187 did not relax vascular tissues in which the endothelium had been mechanically removed. Acetylcholine did not produce a significant endothelium-dependent relaxation of primate MCA rings, but did relax rings of primate common carotid artery. Pretreatment with chlorpheniramine (an H1-receptor antagonist) prevented histamine-induced relaxation; however, cimetidine (an H2-receptor antagonist) had no inhibitory action. It thus seems that histamine mediates relaxation of intact MCA's mostly by an H1-receptor-mediated release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Relaxations induced by histamine and A23187 in MCA's from the clot side were substantially reduced. Moreover, the small component of ACh-induced relaxation was also abolished. Endothelium-independent relaxation induced by glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) occurred in arteries from both the control and the clot sides. Constrictions induced by KC1 and PGF2 alpha were reduced on the clot side of the MCA's. These results suggest that subarachnoid hemorrhage influences both the generation of EDRF and the constriction of affected arteries. The small contraction which was elicited in spastic arteries was fully relaxed by GTN.
