Posterior leukoencephalopathy syndromes have been reported with hypertension, and immunosuppressive and chemotherapy agents. Cerebral vasospasm on MR angiography (MRA) has been noted in cases due to eclampsia. The authors report a case of Balint syndrome with irreversible posterior leukoencephalopathy on MRI following intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine. Hypertension was not present. Diffuse, reversible arterial irregularities consistent with vasospasm were present on MRA during the acute illness.
