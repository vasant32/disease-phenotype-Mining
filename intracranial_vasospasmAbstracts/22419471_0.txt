 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the early management of intracranial ruptured vertebral dissecting aneurysms. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with ruptured vertebral dissecting aneurysms were managed by various treatment modalities according to their conditions. One aneurysm was treated by proximal vertebral artery coiling, 15 aneurysms by aneurysm and parent artery coiling, and 5 aneurysms by stent-assisted coiling (4 of 5 by stent-within-a-stent technique), one by single double-stent. Bloody cerebrospinal fluid was drained by postoperative lumbar subarachnoid drainage in order to prevent cerebral vasospasm. RESULTS: All 22 cases were successful without bleeding complication during the operation.There was 1 case of early postoperative non-aneurysmal hemorrhage, 2 cases of posterial group cranial nerves palsies, 1 case harbored Hunt & Hess IV who gave up treatment. After follow-up for 3-18 months, there was no rebleeding and infarction. Twenty patients recovered well, except 1 having posterial group cranial nerves palsies. Fourteen cases were followed up by angiography. In 3 patients treated by stent-assisted coiling, DSA showed that aneurysms disappeared and loading vessel passed freely.DSA of 11 cases with aneurysm and parent artery coiling demonstrated complete obliteration of the dissection without aneurysm imaging. CONCLUSION: Early endovascular treatment of ruptured vertebral dissecting aneurysms is essential. The selective method of endovascular management according to the characteristics of aneurysm is safe and effective. Double stent-assisted coiling should be the first choice.
