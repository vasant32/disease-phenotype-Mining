The pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm that follows aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is poorly understood. Multiple methods have been used to clarify the mechanism of spasmogen-induced vasospasm, however, each method has its own limitations. Cultured cells lose their phenotype and inter-cellular interactions, and animal models are expensive and can be used only in some established centers. Isolated cerebral arteries have been used extensively to study the contractility by transient exposure to spasmogens that, however, can hardly represent cerebral vasospasm that occurs 2-4 days after SAH. In this study, we cultured arteries with bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients of cerebral vasospasm and studied the contractility of the arteries 1, 3 and 4 days later. This method preserves artery wall structure, prolongs exposure of artery to bloody CSF, and is simple and inexpensive. Cultured rat aorta showed enhanced contractile response to 5-HT (p < 0.001) but reduced response to KCl (p < 0.05) 4 days after culturing with bloody CSF. We concluded that the contractility of arteries was modified by prolonged incubation with bloody CSF. Our observations in this study could be important and may explain some aspects of pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.
