Cerebral vasospasm is a serious complication for patients suffering from acute nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Despite numerous efforts to analyze the multifactorial pathomechanisms, it is still unclear whether vasospasm is a primary result caused by the release of vasoactive mediators or a secondary event due to severe destructions of the vessel architecture. This study was designed in order to investigate the reactivity of postmortem human basilar arteries upon exogenous vasoconstrictors, to study time-dependent changes in vessel morphology and to control responsiveness to agonists and selective antagonists. Therefore, isolated rings and spirally cut strips of bovine- and human basilar arteries were incubated with exogenous vasoconstrictors and specific antagonists (Daltroban, Ketanserin). Light and electron microscopic studies were performed in order to analyze the morphological changes in vessel tissues. Our results suggest that postmortem human basilar arteries are a suitable pharmacological tool studying the effects of contractile mediators.
