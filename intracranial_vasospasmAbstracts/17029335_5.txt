OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether the combination of cyclosporine and simvastatin could ameliorate cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in a canine model to a greater extent than simvastatin alone. METHODS: Animals were assigned to one of three groups: control (five dogs), simvastatin alone (four), or simvastatin and cyclosporine (four). A double SAH model was used. Baseline basilar artery (BA) angiograms were obtained. These were repeated at Days 3, 7, and 10. Measurement of the BA diameter was performed. Decreased BA diameter was seen on Day 3 in the control and simvastatin/cyclosporine group. A return to baseline diameters was seen by Day 7. An increase from baseline diameter was seen in the simvastatin group at Day 10. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporine may interfere with the vasodilatory effects of simvastatin. Vasodilation greater than baseline is seen at Day 10 in the simvastatin group. The combination of simvastatin and cyclosporine does not ameliorate cerebral vasospasm in a canine model to a greater extent than simvastatin alone.
