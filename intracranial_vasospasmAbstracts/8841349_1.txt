BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Compaction of extracellular matrix (ECM) lattices by cultured fibroblasts was accelerated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The rate of acceleration was significantly related to the clinical grade of vasospasm. However, the mechanism remains unclear. Evidence exists for an important role in cerebral vasospasm for protein kinase C (PKC). The purpose of this study was to help clarify whether PKC has a role in contraction of the ECM. METHODS: We studied the effects of a myristoylated PKC peptide inhibitor (Myr-Arg-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala-Leu-Arg-Gln-Lys-Asn-Val) (PKC peptide inhibitor), (5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-homopiperazine (HA-1077) (inhibitor of protein kinase A, myosin light-chain kinase, and protein kinase G), 7-deacetyl-6-(N-ace-tylglycyl)-forskolin (forskolin) (adenyl cyclase activator), and diacylglycerol-lactone (DAG-lactone) (PKC activator) on fibroblast-populated collagen lattice compaction with or without CSF from SAH patients. Four sets of fibroblasts were used: three explanted from skin and one from cerebral artery. RESULTS: Moderate and high concentrations of PKC peptide inhibitor inhibited lattice compaction with or without acceleration by CSF. Low concentration of PKC peptide inhibitor enhanced acceleration by CSF but had no effects without CSF. HA-1077 could not inhibit lattice compaction. Forskolin inhibited compaction. DAG-lactone accelerated compaction in early phases. CONCLUSIONS: In the mechanism of acceleration of contraction of ECM under the influence of CSF, PKC seems to have two different roles. Protein kinase A and myosin light-chain kinase apparently play more minor roles than PKC in the mechanism, but no evidence was found of a role for protein kinase G activation in matrix compaction.
