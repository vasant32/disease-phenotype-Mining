Summary: We report a case of a woman with pregnancyrelated thrombotic thrombocytopoenic purpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome (TTP/HUS) who developed cerebral vasospasm similar to that seen in the other pregnancy-related thrombotic microangiopathic syndromes of eclampsia and HELLP syndrome. A further complication in this case was the development of a focal intracerebral haemorrhage necessitating surgical removal. Despite a successful evacuation of the haematoma and several plasma exchange treatments she developed recurrent haemolysis and thrombocytopoenia with an eventual fatal outcome due to severe pulmonary and gastrointestinal haemorrhage.
