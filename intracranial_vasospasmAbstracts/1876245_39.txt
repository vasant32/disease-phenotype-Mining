We investigated the histological changes between arteries constricted by endothelin for 7 days and vasospastic arteries induced by the double injection of autologous blood. Group 1 was a sham-operated group. Group 2 animals received a continuous cisternal injection of endothelin-1 (1.7 x 10(-9) mol/7 days) by a miniosmotic pump implanted in the neck musculature for 7 days. Group 3 received double injections of cisternal blood administered 48 hours apart. Angiography showed severe constriction of the basilar artery, 34.6% and 43% in Groups 2 and 3, respectively, on Day 7. Histological study showed marked constriction of the basilar artery in both Group 2 and Group 3. Degenerative changes in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were observed in both Group 2 and Group 3. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated endothelin-1 in the endothelial cells in Group 2, but not in Group 1 or in Group 3. It is suggested that endothelin-1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.
