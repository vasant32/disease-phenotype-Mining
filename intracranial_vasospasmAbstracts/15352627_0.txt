Cerebral vasospasm remains a leading cause of morbidity and increasing mortality rates following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The rate of vasospasm and the outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale; GOS) especially in poor WFNS grade were retrospectively analyzed over a 6-year period. Patients were divided into three different groups. The first group (pre-group) consisted of 43 patients (grade IV: 31, grade V: 12), who were admitted between 1996 and 1998. When vasospasm occurred, they were mainly treated by papaverine (PPV) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). In the second group (mil-cis group), for the prevention of vasospasm, cisternal irrigation therapy with milrinone was applied in 24 patients (grade IV: 13, grade V: 11), who were admitted in the period between 1999 and 2001. The third group, (w/o mil-cis group), consisted of 30 patients (grade IV: 15, grade V: 15), in whom cisternal irrigation therapy was not able to be carried out. In grade IV, vasospasm was observed in 66% of the patients the first group, 50% in the w/o mil-cis group and significantly less in the mil-cis group (15%, p<0.024). In grade V, the rate of vasospasm was also lower in the mil-cis group but no statistical significance was revealed. Although the rate of favorable outcome in GOS was highest and the rate of death was least in the mil-cis group in both grade IV and V, only the trend was observed. Many factors should be considered, Cisternal irrigation therapy with milrinone reduced the occurrence of vasospasm. However, outcome was not improved because of the initial poor clinical condition.
