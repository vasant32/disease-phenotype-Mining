The clinical status, angiographic and Doppler ultrasound transcranial findings were compared in 50 patients with acute subarachnoidal hemorrhage (40 with aneurysmal hemorrhage and 10 with unknown hemorrhage). There was a correlation between the change in the linear velocity of blood flow in the cerebral arteries and the clinical manifestations of arterial spasm-induced brain ischemia. With this, Doppler signs of arterial spasm appeared as clinical manifestations 3-4 days earlier. The linear velocity of middle cerebral arterial blood flow, which is critical for the development of ischemic complications of arterial spasm was 295 +/- 6 cm/sec. The magnitude and duration of the excess critical level of the linear velocity of blood flow and the presence of arterial spasm in the contralateral hemisphere may determine whether the progressive ischemic symptoms are reversible or irreversible. A further course of arterial spasm, development of ischemic complications and their outcomes may be predicted by the increasing gradient of the linear velocity in the cerebral arteries at days 4-6 of subarachnoidal hemorrhage and the extent of spasm.
