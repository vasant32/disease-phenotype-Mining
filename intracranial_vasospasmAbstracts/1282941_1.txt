The responses to intraluminally applied substance P (SP) were examined in isolated and perfused canine basilar arteries using the stainless-steel cannula inserting method. In control vessels with intact endothelium, this peptide induced a monophasic dilation at lower doses, and a biphasic response, i.e., an initial dilation followed by a secondary constriction at higher doses. After extraluminal treatment with oxyhemoglobin, the dilation was attenuated and the constriction was augmented. After endothelial removal with intraluminal saponin, the dilation was reduced and the constriction was enhanced significantly. This potentiated constriction was significantly depressed by indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), OKY-046 (a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor), and nimodipine (a calcium antagonist), but not by AA-861 (a lipoxygenase inhibitor). These results suggest that SP has two distinct effects (an endothelium-dependent dilation and a direct constriction) and that the potentiated constriction in the absence of endothelium may be related to the action of thromboxane A2, linked with calcium influx into the smooth muscle cells of cerebral arteries. This mechanism may be implicated in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
