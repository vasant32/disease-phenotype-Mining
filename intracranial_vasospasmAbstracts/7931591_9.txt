Papaverine (PPV) is a nonspecific vasodilator with widespread clinical uses in the treatment of arterial spasm. It has also been utilized in an attempt to reverse cerebral vasospasm. Recent angiographic results have demonstrated significant reversal of vasospasm in large vessels after selective intra-arterial application of PPV; however, these impressive results lacked good clinical correlation. In this study, phorbol dibutyrate was used to stimulate protein kinase C in an in vitro model of cerebral microvessels. Papaverine was found to elicit a dose-dependent exacerbation of phorbol dibutyrate-induced microvascular constriction in this model system. Because protein kinase C is thought to play a key role in the development of cerebral vasospasm, PPV-induced vasoconstriction represents a potentially important deleterious effect that may not be apparent on angiography. Such a constrictor response may compromise the beneficial vasodilatory effect seen with intra-arterial injection of PPV.
