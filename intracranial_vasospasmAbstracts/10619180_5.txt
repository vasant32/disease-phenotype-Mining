We examined the effect of intracisternal application of endothelin-1 (ET-1) on the permeability of fluorescein into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in beagle dogs in order to evaluate its role in disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability seen in the subarachnoid hemorrhage animal model. Intracisternal application of their autologous blood for producing a canine two-hemorrhage model revealed an enhanced fluorescein permeability into the CSF together with the development of cerebral vasospasm. A single dose of ET-1 (40 pmol/animal) significantly increased penetration of fluorescein compared with that in normal dogs. Although its magnitude was much less than that in the two-hemorrhage model after the first administration of ET-1, the second challenge of the same dose of ET-1 with a 48-h interval produced marked disruption of BBB permeability similar to those in the animal model. Moreover, the ET-1-induced enhancement of fluorescein permeability into the CSF was completely prevented by intracisternal pretreatment with an endothelin ET(A)-receptor selective antagonist, S-0139 (0.03 mg/kg), as were the ET-1-induced cerebral vasoconstriction and behavioral changes as previously reported. Thus, we conclude that ET-1 acting on the adventitial site of brain in dogs contributes to the disruption of BBB permeability via endothelin ET(A)-receptor mediation.
