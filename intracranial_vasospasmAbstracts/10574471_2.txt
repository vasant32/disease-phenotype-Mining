The chronic stage of vasospasm occurring several days after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is characterized by the development of histopathologic changes in cerebral arteries causing cerebral ischemia. Numerous experimental data indicate the involvement of immune mechanisms in the angiopathy caused by SAH. Endogenous opioids play also an important role in the ischemic lesions of the brain. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) induces the release of beta-endorphin (beta-END) from hypothalamic neurons and also from mononuclear white blood cells. The function of CRH and beta-END in vasospasm following SAH and the interrelationship between neuroendocrine and immune changes requires further elucidation. In the present study we investigated the influence of CRH injected into cerebral cisterna magna (CM) of rats on beta-END-like level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in acute and chronic phase of cerebral vasospasm following artificial SAH. Acutely CRH induced a significant rise of beta-END-like in CSF both in SAH and sham SAH rats. However, in rats subjected to SAH, a single injection of CRH caused a prolonged rise of 5-END in CSF, which was also seen 2 days after SAH, during the chronic phase of vasospasm. The obtained results indicate that CRH increases neuroendocrine changes induced by SAH, probably by an activation of immune cells involved in the patomechanism of chronic vasospasm.
