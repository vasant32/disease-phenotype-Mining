Cerebral vasospasm is a potentially life-threatening complication following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from a ruptured cerebral artery aneurysm. Traditionally, vasospasm has been treated with a variety of medical interventions. However, surgical intervention with an extracranial to intracranial (EC/IC) bypass graft has yielded promising results in a limited group of patients. This article discusses the theoretical causes of cerebral vasospasm, its clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment modalities. Nursing interventions for the patient experiencing cerebral vasospasm are also presented.
