A computerized monitoring and analyzing system for neurosurgical intensive care has been developed. The system continuously monitors the function of the central nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Correlation between such parameters can be analyzed automatically. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and intracranial pressure (ICP) were monitored as parameters for CNS function and condition. The cardiovascular and respiratory systems were monitored by heart rate, systemic blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, respiratory rate, and expiratory O2 and CO2 pressures. Body temperature was also monitored continuously. Sequential changes of those parameters were displayed on time-dependent trend graphs, and correlations between each parameter were automatically analyzed by linear regression equations. The clinical applicability of the system was demonstrated in the postoperative treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured intracranial aneurysm. In such a case, EEG slowing was observed in this system prior to clinical deterioration, and had a correlation with a decrease of pulmonary arterial pressure. Thus, the necessity for restoration of intravascular volume was realized before clinical deterioration progressed.
