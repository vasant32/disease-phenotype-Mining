 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of nimodipine on symptomatic cerebral vasospasm in rabbits. METHODS: Twenty four japanese white rabbits which ligation of bilateral common carotid arteries and no neurological deficits were randomized to sham-operation, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and nimodipine which injected of nimodipine 0.1 mg/kg, continuous vein administration 5 day. The behavior scores, neurological scores were observed everyday and cerebral angiography changes were measured twice by 3D-CTA, and basilar artery was removed for pathological examination after last CTA examination. RESULTS: In SAH group, The basilar artery were significantly vasoconstrictive on 5 days, neurological scores were increased, and the basilar artery was found apoptosis-like changes under light microscopic and electron microscope. Nimodipine group could not dilated the basilar artery arteriospasm after SAH, but it could attenuate neurological deficit, and obviously alleviate the pathological changes of basilar artery. CONCLUSION: Nimodipine could not vasodilation of basilar artery in SCVS, but obviously could alleviate neurological changes and pathological changes of basilar artery in rabbits with symptomatic cerebral vasospasm.
