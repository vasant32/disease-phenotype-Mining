Arteriograms of the basilar artery reveal that dopamine given intracisternally to dogs can generate cerebral vasospasm. This finding supports a recent hypothesis of others that dopamine may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm, especially since many substances are known which fail to produce such spasm. Compared to blood or prostaglandin E2, however, the spasm induced by dopamine was delayed in onset, less in incidence, and usually less intense. Possible explanations for such experimental differences are discussed.
