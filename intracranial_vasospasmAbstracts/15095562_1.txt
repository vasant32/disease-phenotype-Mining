BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the changes in intracranial hemodynamics and assess the presence of vasospasm in children with migraine during the intermigrainous period. METHODS: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography findings, clinical examinations, and the vasospastic index of Lindegaard were analyzed for children who fulfilled the criteria for childhood migraine. The significance of the presence of vasospasm and abnormal hemodynamics were statistically analyzed using the normal approximation to the binomial test method. TCD sonography was performed using the standard published techniques for children. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients between the ages of 5 and 17 years who had undergone at least one TCD sonographic examination were selected for this study. A total of 113 TCD sonographic examinations were performed on the patients. Elevated mean blood flow velocities were found in 23 of 62 patients (37%) (P < .001). Early vasospasm was found in 4 of 62 patients (6.5%) (P < .001). Bruits were noted in 35 of 62 patients (56%). CONCLUSIONS: This study raises the possibility of cerebral vasospasm in the intermigrainous period in childhood migraine. Further studies are needed to elaborate on the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular behavior during this period. These findings may have a significant impact on the current clinical treatment of childhood migraine.
