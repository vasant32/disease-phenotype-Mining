The correlation was studied between angiographically demonstrated vasospasm, ischaemic focus demonstrated by computed tomography and the clinical condition in 100 patients within 2 weeks after spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage. The control group comprised 50 patients after subarachnoid haemorrhage without vasospasm. The clinical condition of the patients with vasospasm was more serious than in the control group. The proportion of patients with clinical grade I was 24% in the group of vasospasm and 50% in the control group. Ischaemic foci were found in computed tomograms four times as frequently in the group with vasospasm than in the control group. Neurological deficit was noted in 41% of patients with vasospasm and in 26% in the control group. The study confirmed correlations between vasospasm, cerebral infarction and neurological deficit but these correlations were not strong.
