Posttraumatic cerebral arterial spasm occurred in a 51-year-old male after a fall striking the left frontal region of the head. The initial computed tomography was identical to that of severe subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured aneurysm. He was neurologically stable for the 1st week following the accident, but his condition deteriorated rapidly, culminating in death due to severe delayed cerebral arterial spasm on the 15th day after injury. Postmortem examination revealed neither cerebrovascular abnormalities such as aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation nor evidence of torn arteries.
