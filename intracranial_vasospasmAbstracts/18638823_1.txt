A serial measurement of endothelin-1(ET-1) levels in plasma, cisternal and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) was performed in 16 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The patients were classified as grade III or IV according to the clinical grade of Hunt and Hess, and computerised tomography(CT) was classified as Fisher's CT group 3. Cisternal and ventricular CSF and plasma were obtained from the patients on the day of operation days 0-3, days 5-8 and days 14-18 after SAH. ET-I concentration in each sample was quantified by sandwich-enzyme immunoassay. ET-I levels in plasma and CSF were the highest between days 0-3 and then decreased. The ET-I levels in the cisternal CSF were significantly higher during days 0-3(p<0. 01) and days 5-8(p<0. 01) than those in the ventricular CSF It is suggested that ET-I could play an important role in the early stages of the cerebral vasospasm.
