Endovascular treatment by balloon angioplasty or intra-arterial papaverine infusion has been established as a valuable treatment option in patients with cerebral vasospasm refractory to maximal medical therapy. A summary of the indications, applications and limitations is provided for microcatheter guided selective papaverine infusion and transluminal balloon angioplasty in patients who sustain cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid haemorrhage. Structured neuro-intensive and endovascular treatment of imminent vasospasm integrate papaverine administration and balloon angioplasty as complimentary rather than alternative techniques.
