A large number of experimental data suggest a possible biochemical hypothesis for the trigger stimulus of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Among several classes of possible spasmogens, arachidonic acid metabolites may play a primary role. Authors have measured with radioimmunoassay technique (R.I.A.) the levels of four arachidonate metabolites (PGD2, TxB2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and i-LTC4) in lumbar and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients admitted with diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH. In all cases a significant activation of arachidonate metabolism is found, if compared to control cases. Patients with demonstrated vasospasm have significantly higher CSF levels of PGD2 and i-LTC4. Cisternal CSF levels of four metabolites are significantly higher than lumbar CSF levels. This suggests the correlation between subarachnoidal clot extension and the risk for vasospasm. Authors also present an experimental animal model of SAH, which is reliable from a pathological standpoint. This model could be therefore used in the study of neurochemical and neuropharmacological aspects of SAH.
