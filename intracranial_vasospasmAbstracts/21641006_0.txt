 OBJECTIVE: To present our experience in the diagnosis and intravascular treatment of cerebral pseudoaneurysms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present 11 pseudoaneurysms (2 traumatic, 2 mycotic, 3 iatrogenic, and 4 with other causes). We analyze the methods and diagnostic criteria, radiological and clinical outcome, the criteria used in making decisions about treatment, the method of treatment, and the complications. RESULTS: Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cerebral pseudoaneurysms; the diagnostic criteria in the literature include: aneurysms with early morphological changes and distal aneurysms or proximal aneurysms associated with another distal one, in the context of the right symptoms and signs. In the nine patients treated with endovascular techniques, the treatment objective was achieved and rebleeding did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: In cases with clinical suspicion of a pseudoaneurysm, the patient should undergo angiography. This is especially important in patients with inexplicable cerebral hemorrhage and in those with septicemia. CT angiography and MR angiography have good diagnostic accuracy and can replace conventional angiography. However, the treatment of choice is endovascular and treatment should not be delayed unless access to the pseudoaneurysm is impeded, usually due to severe cerebral vasospasm.
