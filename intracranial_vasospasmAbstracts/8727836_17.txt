We report two patients who had symptomatic cerebral vasospasm and cardiac failure after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and who were treated successfully with intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation therapy. Both patients developed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema while receiving postoperative hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilutional (Triple-H) therapy for symptomatic cerebral vasospasm. Both cases of cardiac failure were refractory to maximum pressor and inotropic infusions. Intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation was used to optimize cardiac performance to allow continuation of Triple-H therapy and to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion in an attempt to decrease the risk of cerebral ischemic complications. Both patients have had good long-term outcomes. These two cases illustrate the potential usefulness of the intra-aortic balloon pump as an adjunct to Triple-H therapy in patients with symptomatic cerebral vasospasm and cardiac failure. To our knowledge, this report documents the first clinical application of this adjunctive therapy for vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
