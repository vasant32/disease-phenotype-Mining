Cerebral vasospasm is a deadly complication following the rupture of intracranial aneurysms. The time course of cerebral vasospasm is unique in that it is slow developing, usually takes 4-7 days to peak, but lasts up to 2-3 weeks, and is resistant to most known vasodilators. These special features make cerebral vasospasm the most important determinant in the outcome of patients suffering subarachnoid hemorrhage. The available treatment strategies include mechanical dilation of spastic cerebral arteries (angioplasty) and non-selective vasodilatation such as by Ca(2+) channel blockers. One new development in the experimental treatment of cerebral vasospasm is the looming target of signaling pathways. Understanding vasospastic signals in cerebral arteries might offer a new avenue for selective treatment of cerebral vasospasm in the future.
