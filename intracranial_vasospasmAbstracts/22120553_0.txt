 OBJECTIVE: Papaverine hydrochloride (PPV) has been widely used for pharmacologic angioplasty to dilate spastic vessels after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Colforsin daropate hydrochloride (CDH) has also recently been reported to be useful for reversal of cerebral vasospasm (CV). In this study, we compared the impacts of intraarterial PPV and CDH on the outcomes of SAH patients. METHODS: A consecutive series of SAH patients were retrospectively analyzed. Ninety-eight and 133 patients were included in the study during 1998-1999 (group A) and 2003-2005 (group B), respectively. PPV or CDH was the only agent used for pharmacologic angioplasty in groups A and B, respectively. Good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score ≤ 2 at discharge. RESULTS: The percentages of patients without CV who had good outcomes were similar in groups A (78%) and B (81%, P = 0.91). However, the percentage of patients with CV with a good outcome was significantly higher in group B (66%) than in group A (34%, P = 0.032). Logistic regression revealed that age ≤ 65 years (P = 0.0001), World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade ≤ 2 (P < 0.0001), CV (P = 0.0001), and group B (P = 0.0069) were independent causative factors for good outcome in the overall patient population. Age ≤ 65 (P = 0.0002) and WFNS grade ≤ 2 (P < 0.0001) were independent causative factors for good outcome in patients without CV, whereas only group B (P = 0.0089) was an independent factor for good outcome in patients with CV. CONCLUSION: CDH appears to be associated with a better outcome in patients with SAH.
