Cerebral vasospasm is currently recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients surviving subarachnoid hemorrhage due to intracranial aneurysmal rupture. Effective management and possible prevention of the ischemic sequelae of vasospasm can occur if the clinical syndrome of vasospasm is detected in its earliest stages. This article acquaints the reader with the significant risk factors associated with development of vasospasm, the temporal profile of occurrence and the signs and symptoms of the clinical syndrome. A brief overview of some popular theories of vasospasm etiology and pathogenesis is presented. Additionally, a protocol for detection is provided incorporating the knowledge of population at risk, temporal profile and signs and symptoms of cerebral vasospasm.
