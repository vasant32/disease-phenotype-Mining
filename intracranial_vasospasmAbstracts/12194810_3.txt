Cerebral vasospasm and related ischemic stroke continue to be significant complicating factors in the course of many patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage from berry aneurysm rupture. The risk of this well-recognized but poorly understood complication can be estimated on the basis of patient medical history, neurologic examination, and head CT findings. Every patient with possible risk needs specialized neurologic intensive care unit care after aneurysm obliteration. Surgical and pharmacologic wash-out of subarachnoid blood around the basal arteries, proper management of intracranial pressure and fluid status, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and fever, as well as use of calcium channel blockers, have been considered helpful in patient management prior to and with the symptomatic vasospasm development. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound is important in detecting vasospasm before the patient suffers ischemic neurologic deficit or infarct. Elevated TCD velocities often initiate the use of triple-H (HHH: hypertension, hemodilution, and hypervolemia) therapy and subsequently guide it. Up to the end of the first 3 weeks after subarachnoid hemorrhage and aneurysm obliteration, development of any focal neurologic deficit or mental deterioration, unless convincingly proven otherwise, is assumed to be from cerebral vasospasm. When a hemodynamically significant vasospasm in the arterial segments of clinical concern is suggested, emergency cerebral angiography with balloon dilatation angioplasty or intra-arterial infusion of vasodilating agents may be helpful in relieving ischemic symptoms.
