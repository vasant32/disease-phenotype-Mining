 BACKGROUND: Diffuse cerebral vasospasm after brain tumor resection is rare. This is the first report of diffuse cerebral vasospasm following resection of a posterior fossa ependymoma. Various etiologies as to the cause of vasospasm after brain tumor resection have been described. A review of the current literature and pathophysiology is discussed. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 23-year-old man developed diffuse cerebral vasospasm 12 days after resection of a posterior fossa ependymoma. He recovered back to his post-operative baseline following aggressive treatment using both hemodynamic augmentation and endovascular methods. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic deterioration in the post-operative period following tumor resection, unexplained by other causes, should raise the concern for possible cerebral vasospasm. Vasospasm in these cases can be diffuse. Early recognition and prompt treatment using both hemodynamic augmentation and endovascular techniques can significantly improve patient outcome.
