BACKGROUND: Vasospasm may occur following intracranial tumor resection but is uncommon following resection of tumors in the posterior fossa. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: Here, we report an unusual pediatric case of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following resection of a posterior fossa medulloblastoma in a 10-year-old child. CT angiogram and serial Transcranial Doppler (TCD) studies confirmed the presence of vasospasm and response to hemodynamic augmentation therapy, resulting in favorable outcome. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates an unusual complication of posterior fossa tumor resection, and the potential utility of TCD studies in the detection and management of vasospasm in pediatric neurocritical care.
