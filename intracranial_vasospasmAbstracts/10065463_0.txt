We reported a case of peduncular hallucination after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient underwent endovascular embolization of an intracranial aneurysm using the Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs) 9 days after SAH. On the 11th day, she reported visual hallucination: a maggot was on the ceiling, or a soldier who wore green clothes was standing by a locker. The hallucination was vivid, well-formed and associated with insomnia, suggesting peduncular hallucination. A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed small infarctions of right frontal lobe, which were not responsible for the visual hallucination. Hyperdynamic therapy relieved the visual hallucination 23 days after SAH. It was conceivable that vasospasm was the cause of the infarction and visual hallucination. Only 4 cases with peduncular hallucination after SAH were reported in conjunction with vasospasm. The symptom may be concealed by disturbance of consciousness. Visual hallucination should be considered as a sign of cerebral vasospasm, and an appropriate treatment should be done at right time.
