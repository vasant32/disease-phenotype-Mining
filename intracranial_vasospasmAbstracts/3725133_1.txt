Calcium-channel entry blockers are drugs with different chemical properties and a common pharmacological characteristic. Calcium is very important in many physiological mechanisms and could be involved in neuronal damage following cerebral ischemia. Thus, calcium-channel blockers agents could be of interest in medical treatment of cerebrovascular diseases, headache and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Calcium-channel blockers seem to have a direct protective role against neuronal ischemic damage and/or a direct action on cerebral vessels. Some clinical experiences have suggested a protective role of nimodipine in the prevention of ischemic complications related to cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
