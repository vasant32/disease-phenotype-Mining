OBJECT: Rho A, a small guanosine triphosphate-binding protein, and rho kinases have been suggested to play an important role in the agonist-induced myofilament Ca++ sensitization and cytoskeletal organization of smooth-muscle cells. To discover their possible roles in the prolonged contraction seen in cerebral vasospasm, the authors investigated the messenger (m)RNA expressions of rho A and rho-associated kinases alpha and beta in the basilar artery (BA) of a rat double cisternal blood-injection model. METHODS: An experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was achieved in rats by twice injecting autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna of each animal. The mRNAs for rho A and rho-associated kinases alpha and beta of the rat BA were analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The cisternal blood injection induced a marked corrugation of elastic lamina and contraction of smooth-muscle cells observed with the aid of light and transmission electron microscopy in the rat BA on Days 3, 5, and 7. Results of the RT-PCR revealed that mRNAs for rho A and rho kinases alpha and beta were expressed in the rat BA and that they were significantly upregulated and reached their peaks on Day 5. CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA upregulation of these proteins indicates that activation of rho A/rho kinase-related signal transduction pathways is involved in the development of long-lasting contraction of cerebral arteries after SAH.
