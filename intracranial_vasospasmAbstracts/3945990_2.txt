In the rat an intracisternal injection of blood induces an angiographically demonstrable biphasic cerebral arterial vasospasm. Chemical destruction of the central serotoninergic and dopaminergic pathways prior to the cisternal blood injection does not affect the spasm pattern after the subarachnoid haemorrhage. It is suggested that neither system plays a role in the development of spasm.
