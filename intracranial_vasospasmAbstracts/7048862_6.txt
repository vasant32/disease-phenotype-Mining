Prostacyclin (PGI2), a strong vasodilator of cerebral vessels and potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, was infused intravenously into seven cats after induction of prolonged vasospasm by hourly application of oxyhaemoglobin solution into the subarachnoid space round the basilar artery. PGI2, at a concentration of 50 ng/kg/min, was effective in releasing the vasospasm in the seven cats. It did not produce significant hypotension. This report gives our results and the probable mechanism of action of PGI2 in cerebral vasospasm.
