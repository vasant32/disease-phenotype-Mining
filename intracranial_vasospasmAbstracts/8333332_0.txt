The present study aimed to examine the turnover of phospholipids such as PI, PC and PE, the time course of PKC activity and the phosphorylation of 20 kDa MLC in the canine BA undergoing chronic VS. The phosphorylation of 20 kDa MLC was not augmented in the spastic BA. Turnover of PC and PE was detectably stimulated on day 7. The cytosolic PKC activity was down-regulated on days 4 and 7, while the membrane PKC activity remained unchanged during these periods. The present results indicate that a process which affected the membrane lipid metabolism, PKC metabolism and PKC activity occurred in spastic BA.
