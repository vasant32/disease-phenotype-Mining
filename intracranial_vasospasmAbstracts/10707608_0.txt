Syndromes of intracranial hemorrhage, and particularly subarachnoidal, i.e., intracerebral hemorrhage (SAH and IH) present clinical entities that are the most severe conditions in neurology. Timely recognition, diagnosis and adequate therapy are imperative. The most important factor that aggravates an already difficult prognosis of those entities is cerebral vasospasm. Upon the presented facts, the aim of this investigation was to establish the value and role of administration of selective calcium channel blocker--nimodipine in patients with SAH and IH compared to the degree of neurological and functional impairment, as well as the recovery of the function of consciousness compared to the patients with those syndromes from an earlier period, who were not treated with this medicament. Investigation comprised 30 patients who received nimodipine and 20 patients without this agent in therapeutic program. Results of the investigation confirmed significant difference concerning the neurological recovery, improvement of functional capability and recovery or consciousness disturbances, respectively, in patients who received nimodipine compared to the group without this agent. It can be concluded that nimodipine as calcium channel blocker with multitopic pharmacological effects on mechanism of SAH or IH development, respectively, as well as on the development of complications of those syndromes, particularly to the development of vasospasm and reactive ischemia, with the improvement of hemorrheologic disorders deserves to be included as the unavoidable segment of therapeutic program of SAH and IH syndrome immediately after clinical phenomenology is revealed.
