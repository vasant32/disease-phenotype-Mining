We investigated the effect of two different doses of dexmedetomidine on vasospasm in a rat model of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). SAH was induced by injecting 0.3 mL blood into the cisterna magna in all rat groups except the control (Group C). At 1 hour and 24 hours after SAH, 5 microg/kg dexmedetomidine was given to group D5, and 10 microg/kg dexmedetomidine was given to group D10. No medication was administered to the haemorrhage group (Group H). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and paraoxonase (PON) levels were measured at 48 hours after SAH. Mean wall thickness (MWT), mean luminal diameter (MLD), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression of the basilar artery were evaluated. MDA levels and MWT were lower in the dexmedetomidine groups. The lowest MDA levels and MWT were found in Group D10. The MLD was lowest in Group H. PCNA expression was observed only in Group D10. We concluded that dexmedetomidine reduces oxidative stress and vasospasm following SAH in a dose-dependent manner.
