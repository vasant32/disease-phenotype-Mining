BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) dilates constricted arteries at the circle of Willis to reverse cerebral ischemia caused by cerebral vasospasm. Although 90% of the patients show angiographic improvement after PTA, only 70% show clinical improvement. Why some patients do not improve after PTA is unknown. We report on a 48-year-old woman who failed to improve after PTA and died from aneurysm rerupture. Pathologic studies were performed to determine why PTA failed to reverse the symptoms of cerebral ischemia. METHODS: The arteries of the brain were studied by light microscopy using Gomori's trichrome stain. The arteries were also studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: The arteries that were dilated with PTA showed compression of the connective tissue, stretching of the internal elastic lamina, and a combination of compression and stretching of the smooth muscle. The small arteries and arterioles that had been treated with an infusion of intraarterial papaverine were constricted with a thickened intimal layer. CONCLUSION: The persistence of cerebral vasospasm in small and perforating arteries may contribute to the failure of cerebral ischemia to reverse after PTA.
