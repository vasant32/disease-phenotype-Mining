Two patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage underwent CT angiography and conventional angiography at presentation. In each patient, both studies were repeated after the onset of intracranial vasospasm. In both cases, CT angiograms were able to demonstrate convincingly the conventional angiographic findings. CT angiography may prove useful in the evaluation of vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
