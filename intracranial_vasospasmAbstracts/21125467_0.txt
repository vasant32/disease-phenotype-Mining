 PURPOSE: symptomatic cerebral vasospasm (SCVS) is still lacking in reliable early warning methods and often diagnosed after clinical deterioration of neurological function, making prevention and treatment extremely passive. This study investigates the risk factors relevant to SCVS after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to provide useful information for clinical work. MATERIALS AND METHODS: clinical data of 211 patients with SAH was reviewed in this study. 16 risk factors relevant to SCVS were retrospectively analyzed, including univariate analysis and logistic analysis. RESULTS: of 211 patients, 81 were found to have SCVS (38.4%). Univariate analysis showed that age, history of hypertension, Hunt-Hess grade at admission, modified Fisher grade, aneurysm location, fever and intraventricular blood clot reached statistical significance (P < 0.05), suggesting that they might be risk factors to SCVS. However, logistic analysis showed that only age (OR=1.027, 95% CI=1.002-1.053, P < 0.05) and modified Fisher grade (OR=2.985, 95% CI=2.048-4.352, P < 0.05) entered the regression equation, suggesting both were independent risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: SCVS is the final result of multiple factors acting together. Age and modified Fisher grades are independent risk factors to SCVS.
