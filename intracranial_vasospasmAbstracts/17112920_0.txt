We report the case of a male liver transplant recipient who developed de novo migraine while on tacrolimus therapy. Considering the inadequate control of pain using nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, rizatriptan benzoate (10 mg orally) was administered (double administration). After both administrations a clinically transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred. Rizatriptan was discontinued, the patient recovered without sequelae from both episodes of TIA. Remission of migraine occurred after discontinuation of tacrolimus and substitution with cyclosporine. We suggest that the association of rizatriptan and tacrolimus could potentially lead to an excessive risk of cerebral vasospasm and should be used with caution. A change in immunosuppressive therapy (from tacrolimus to cyclosporine or sirolimus) may improve migraine and should be the first choice. Further prospective comparative randomized trials are needed to establish the best therapeutic option in this particular subset of patients.
