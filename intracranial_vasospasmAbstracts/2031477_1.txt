An unusually late occurrence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm is reported. The case involves a 50-year-old male who was uneventfully operated on for a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm, with no symptom of cerebral vasospasm, 17 days after sustaining the subarachnoid haemorrhage. Two days after surgery, a right hemiparesis developed and angiography disclosed severe cerebral vasospasm. This case history and the aetiological factors of symptomatic vasospasm are discussed.
