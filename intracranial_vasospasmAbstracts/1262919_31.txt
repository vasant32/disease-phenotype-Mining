In vitro experiments were performed with a small volume chamber to determine the contractile activity of various vasoactive agents on human basilar and anterior cerebral arteries. Cumulative log-dose response curves were obtained for most of the agents tested including serotonin and three different prostaglandins; many of these curves were found to be similar to curves previously obtained with canine cerebral arteries. It was concluded from these similarities that canine cerebral arteries are a good in vitro model for studying human cerebral arterial spasm. It was also demonstrated that human cerebrospinal fluid, collected up to 17 days after a subarachnoid hemorrhage from patients with clinical and angiographic evidence of cerebral arterial spasm, would cause large, dose-dependent contractions in human anterior cerebral arteries.
