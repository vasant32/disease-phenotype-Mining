 OBJECTIVE: To observe the improvement of acupuncture in cerebral vasospasm (CVS) after embolization of ruptured aneurysms. METHODS: Sixty cases were randomly divided into two groups, an acupuncture-medication group and a conventional treatment group, 30 cases in each one. The cases of CVS in conventional treatment group were treated with Nimodipine. In acupuncture-medication group, on the basis of the treatment as conventional treatment group, Baihui (GV 20) and Fengchi (GB 20) were selected as the main acupoints in the treatment of CVS. The treatment lasted for 3 weeks. Hunt-Hess scale for the standard assessment was adopted to determine the severity of disease before and after treatment and compare the efficacy between two groups. The transcranial Doppler (TCD) was conducted on the 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, 14th and 21st days successively after operation, and the average flow velocity of 3 pairs of vessels (ACA, MCA, and PCA) was recorded. CT perfusion (CTP) was taken to test cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (MTT) on the 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st days successively. RESULTS: The improvement of Hunt-Hess scale in acupuncture-medication group was superior to that in conventional treatment group (P < 0.05). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was adopted in the comparison of ACA, MCA, PCA, CBF, CBV and MTT between two groups. The results showed that the therapy in either group achieved the effect on CVS (all P < 0.05). But, the improvements in the above mentioned indices in acupuncture-medication group were superior to those in conventional treatment group (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture at Baihui (GV 20) and Fengchi (GB 20) down-regulates the peak values or upregulates the valley values. It releases the peak of CVS effectively, improves the clinical prognosis significantly and is the effective therapy for CVS after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
