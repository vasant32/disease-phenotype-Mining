A variety of central nervous system lesions like stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, trauma and seizure activity can result in neurogenic pulmonary oedema (NPE). Unilateral neurogenic pulmonary oedema is very rare. There are no reports of unilateral NPE with aneurysmal vasospasm. We present the case of a 55-year-old female who developed respiratory distress with unilateral pulmonary oedema and mild left ventricular dysfunction in the context of postoperative cerebral vasospasm following clipping of ruptured intracranial aneurysm. Neurogenic pulmonary oedema should always be in the differential diagnosis when patients with presumed neurogenic pathology develop respiratory compromise. The diagnosis of unilateral neurogenic pulmonary oedema requires a high index of suspicion. Early initiation of supportive treatment results in good outcome.
