Hemolysate, a proposed causative agent for cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage, produces contraction of cerebral arteries by activation of tyrosine kinases. In addition, hemolysate accelerates fibroblast collagen compaction that could play a role in cerebral vasospasm. We studied the effect of hemolysate on tyrosine phosphorylation and fibroblast collagen compaction in cultured dog cerebral and human dermal fibroblasts using tyrosine kinase inhibitors and tyrosine antibodies (Western blot). 1) Hemolysate was found to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins approximately 64 and 120 kDa. The effect of hemolysate was time- and concentration-dependent. 2) Two main components in hemolysate, oxyhemoglobin and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), produced similar results to that of hemolysate. 3) Tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and tyrphostin A51 (30 microM) markedly reduced the effect of hemolysate on tyrosine phosphorylation. 4) In another study, hemolysate increased fibroblast collagen compaction and the effect of hemolysate was reduced by genistein and tyrphostin A51. We conclude that hemolysate activates tyrosine kinase that may lead to acceleration of fibroblast compaction. This effect of hemolysate may contribute to cerebral vasospasm.
