Vascular smooth muscle is the contractile component of arteries and veins. The control of contraction and relaxation is dependent upon intracellular and extracellular signals. Abnormal contractions can cause and or contribute to pathology such as hypertension, ischemia and infarction. In this review, we address the vascular pathogenesis associated with hypertension and subarachnoid hemorrhage induced cerebral vasospasm. Hypertension is a multifactorial disease with many causes and a profound impact on the cardiovascular system, whereas subarachnoid hemorrhage induced cerebral vasospasm is a pathological vasoconstriction often causing infarction that is thought to be 'caused' by a factor or factors in the CSF following the hemorrhage. However, the mechanism by which the vessels are constricted is unknown. Although the causes for these two pathological vasoconstrictions remain to be determined, we conclude that the common denominator is that these contractile changes result in pathology with devastating consequences to human health.
