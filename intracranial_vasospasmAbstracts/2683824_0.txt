The efficacy of intravenous Nimodipine (used at the rate of 2 mg.h-1) was investigated in the treatment of delayed ischemic deterioration or angiographic vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study. A total of 127 case reports was validated: 73 patients received Nimodipine, 54 received placebo. The two groups were comparable in demographic and clinical status data. Analysis of number of deaths and of patients with severe deficit related to vasospasm alone showed a significant statistical difference (Nimodipine = 19%; Placebo = 49%; p = 0.01). The risk of mortality connected with vasospasm was reduced by 82% in the treated group. Side effects were equally frequent in the two groups. The only difference noted was the increase in heart rate in group Nimodipine. The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of intravenous Nimodipine in the treatment of consequences of cerebral vasospasm after a subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm.
