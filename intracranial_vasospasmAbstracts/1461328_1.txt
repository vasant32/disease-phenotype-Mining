We have studied chronic vasospasm (V.S.) on a primate model (Cynomolgus monkey). The conclusion of several studies are: V.S. is related to the presence of adherent clots along cerebral arteries and when severe may lead to cerebral infarction. Clots removal within 48 h. following subarachnoid hemorrhage reduces V.S. intensity. Free radicals and iron dependent lipidic peroxidation have been involved in cerebral ischemia development. A new aminosteroid (U 74006 F) can act as a free radical phagocyte and antagonize iron dependent lipid oxidation. Histological V.S. changes are less important after S.A.H. with 74006F treatment. Oxyhemoglobin high concentration from red blood cells (R.B.C.) hemolysis has been reported to be responsible for V.S. Therefore induction of R.B.C. release from the clots before hemolysis occurs could prevent from high concentration of oxyhemoglobin. Plasminogen activator can prevent V.S. when used during 72 h. following subarachnoid hemorrhage.
