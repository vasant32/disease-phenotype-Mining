The ability of antithrombin III, an endogenous plasma glycoprotein, to reverse the arterial narrowing in a rabbit model of cerebral vasospasm was evaluated. The vasodilator activity of antithrombin III on rabbit arteries was first assessed in vitro using a myograph-arterial ring preparation. Antithrombin III (10 IU/ml) induced a 55.4% +/- 2.66% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) relaxation in basilar artery precontracted with serotonin (5-HT) in five specimens as compared with a 9.8% +/- 1.6% relaxation of common carotid artery in six specimens. For in vivo analysis, 21 New Zealand White male rabbits were separated into three groups: Group 1 served as normal controls; Group 2 received a subarachnoid blood injection (SAH) and were sacrificed on Day 3 thereafter; and Group 3 animals were subjected to SAH, then received a 2-hour intracisternal infusion of antithrombin III (100 IU) in saline prior to sacrifice on Day 3. Basilar artery caliber was determined using a morphometric method to analyze perfusion-fixed arterial segments. Control basilar artery diameter in Group 1 was 0.64 +/- 0.02 mm. In Group 2 a 27% reduction in arterial caliber to 0.47 +/- 0.03 mm was observed by Day 3 post SAH (p less than 0.0001). Group 3 animals had a mean basilar artery diameter of 0.68 +/- 0.02 mm. This was significantly larger than the untreated SAH rabbits in Group 2 (p less than 0.0001), but not different from control artery diameters in Group 1. The findings demonstrate that antithrombin III in saline has a significant ability to reverse delayed narrowing of the rabbit basilar artery after SAH.
