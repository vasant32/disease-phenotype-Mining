Amphetamine abuse increase risk of hemorrhagic stroke and may result in cerebral vasospasm. In this report we present 31 years old male with intracerebral hemorrhage subsequent to amphetamine intake. Diffuse cerebral vasospasm was found by angiography. Transcranial color coded Doppler sonography was applied for vasospasm monitoring and pharmacological treatment after surgical removal of the intracerebral hemorrhage. Basing on this case we can conclude that cerebral vasospasm should be suspected in patient with amphetamine abuse and hemorrhagic stroke.
