OBJECT: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is an important signaling factor in the vascular proliferation and contraction, the two features of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. We studied the possible involvement of MAPK in hemolysate-induced signal transduction and contraction in rabbit basilar artery. METHODS: Isometric tension was used to record the contractile response of rabbit basilar artery to hemolysate. Western blots using antibodies for MAPK were conducted. 1) Hemolysate produced a concentration-dependent contraction of rabbit basilar artery. Pre-incubation of arteries with MAPK kinase inhibitor PD-98059 markedly reduced the contraction induced by hemolysate. PD-98059 also relaxed, in a concentration-dependent fashion, the sustained contraction induced by hemolysate (10%). 2) Hemolysate produced a time-dependent elevation of MAPK immunoreactivity in Western blot in rabbit basilar artery. MAPK was enhanced 3 min after hemolysate exposure and the effect reached maximum at 5 min. The immunoreactivity of MAPK decayed slowly with time, but the level of MAPK was still higher than the basal level even at two hours after exposure to hemolysate. 3) Pre-incubation of arteries with MAPK kinase inhibitor PD-98059 abolished the effect of hemolysate on MAPK immunoreactivity. CONCLUSION: Hemolysate produced contraction of rabbit basilar artery possibly by activation of MAPK. MAPK inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm.
