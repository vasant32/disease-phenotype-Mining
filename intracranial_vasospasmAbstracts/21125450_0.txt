 BACKGROUND: the aim of this study was to assess and to compare the ability of intrathecal nicergoline and nimodipine in prevention of cerebral vasospasm in a rabbit model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHOD: twenty male New Zealand white rabbits were allocated into four groups randomly. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna. The treatment groups were as follows: (1) control [no SAH (n = 5)], (2) SAH only (n = 5), (3) SAH plus nimodipine (n = 5), and (4) SAH plus nicergoline (n = 5). FINDINGS: there was a statistically significant difference between the mean basilar artery cross-sectional areas and the mean arterial wall thickness measurements of the control and SAH-only groups (p < 0.05). Basilar artery vessel diameter and luminal section areas in group 3 were significantly higher than in group 2 (p < 0.05). Basilar artery vessel diameter and basilar artery luminal section areas in group 4 were significantly higher than in group 2 (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between basilar artery vessel diameter and basilar artery luminal section areas in group 3 and group 4. CONCLUSIONS: these findings demonstrate that intrathecal nicergoline has a vasodilatatory effect in an experimental model of SAH in rabbits but not more than that of nimodipine.
