In this study we investigate the effects of cervical spinal cord stimulation (cSCS) on experimental 'early spasm' in rabbits as described in personal previous experience (Acta Neurochir 2001;143:177-185). Twenty-four adult red Burgundy rabbits wearing a cervical epidural electrode underwent cerebral blood flow (CBF) and functional monitoring of early basilar spasm before and during cSCS. CBF changes, as a consequence of cSCS, occurred in 20 control animals. No CBF changes, consistent with no basilar artery vasospasm, occurred after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) up to the end of the experiments in all the stimulated animals. The role of reversible functional sympathectomy in mediating the effect of spinal cord stimulation on early spasm is discussed. cSCS is able to prevent 'early spasm' due to SAH in all the animals studied, independently from the occurrence and the sign of stimulation induced CBF variations.
