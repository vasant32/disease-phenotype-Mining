 BACKGROUND: Diffuse cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) refractory to medical management can be treated with intra-arterial administration of vasodilators, but valid bedside monitoring for the diagnosis and therapeutic assessment is poorly available. We demonstrate the successful application of regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) monitoring with multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in assisting intra-arterial infusions of fasudil hydrochloride to a patient suffering from post-SAH vasospasm in the distal vascular territories. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old man presented with SAH and intracerebral hematoma due to ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm developed aphasia and right-sided weakness on day 9 after SAH onset. Delayed cerebral ischemia attributable to diffuse vasospasm in the distal territories of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries was suspected. Since the symptoms persisted despite maximal hyperdynamic therapy with dobutamine, intra-arterial fasudil treatment in the setting of rSO(2) monitoring including the spasm-affected vascular territory with four-channel flexible NIRS sensors was subsequently performed. Decreased and fluctuating rSO(2) in angiographically documented vasospastic territories increased immediately after intra-arterial fasudil infusion in accordance with relief of vasospasm that correlated with neurological improvement. The procedure was repeated on day 11 since the effect was transient and neurological deterioration and reduction of rSO(2) recurred. The deficits resolved accompanied by uptake and maintenance of rSO (2) following the intra-arterial fasudil, resulting in favorable functional outcome. CONCLUSION: Continuous rSO(2) monitoring with multichannel NIRS is a feasible strategy to assist intraarterial fasudil therapy for detecting and treating the focal ischemic area exposed to diffuse vasospasm.
