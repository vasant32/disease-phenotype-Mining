A specially designed acoustic stethoscope electronic-computer-analysis system has repeatedly detected and identified angiographically demonstrated anteriorly located intracranial aneurysms by their characteristic signals. The system has detected and measured clinically significant disease in the carotid siphon and bifurcation, even in cases with normal angiograms, and has recorded the onset and disappearance of cerebral vasospasm. Our data suggests that an aneurysm may act as a flexible Helmholtz resonator, possibly being driven by vortex shed or turbulence. Our goal is the development of a safe, non-invasive method by which the physician could investigate warning symptoms of aneurysms, cerebral vasospasm, and arterial disease in order to recommend preventive surgery or medical treatment early before the patient's condition might deteriorate. Individual cases, falsely positive and negative results are discussed.
