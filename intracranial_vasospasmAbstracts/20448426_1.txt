A 33-year-old female presented with a rare case of severe vasospasm following the rupture of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) without subarachnoid hemorrhage. Initial computed tomography (CT) revealed a subcutaneous hematoma and cast formation of intraventricular clots without the deposition of subarachnoid blood in any basal cistern. Cerebral angiography revealed a small AVM located in the right parietal lobe without aneurysmal formations. Repeat CT demonstrated no evidence of subarachnoid clots expected with the presence of intraventricular clots and she was transferred to a general ward. She suffered sudden onset of motor aphasia and disturbance of consciousness on Day 17 after the hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated diffuse cortical infarction and subsequent magnetic resonance angiography revealed severe narrowing of the bilateral internal carotid arteries. Three-dimensional CT angiography on the same day indicated similar findings. She was transferred back to the intensive care unit for critical treatment. However, she suffered persistent mild right hemiparesis and motor aphasia. The characteristic features of vasospasm after intraventricular hemorrhage from AVMs are delayed onset, acute deterioration of consciousness, female predominance, and localization to the bilateral internal carotid arteries. Treatment of patients with AVM rupture should consider the risk of severe vasospasm, even if there is no subarachnoid clot.
