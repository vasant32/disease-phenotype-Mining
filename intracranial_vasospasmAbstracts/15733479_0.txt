OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of intraoperative continuous nimodipine infusion on cerebral vasospasm during intracranial aneurysm surgery. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients under-going intracranial aneurysmal surgery were prospectively randomized into two groups: Isoflurane (group A, n = 15) and nimodipine (group B, n = 15). The patients in group A were maintained with 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) isoflurane anesthesia during the whole procedure. The patients in group B were given nimodipine infusion continuously (20 microg.kg(-1).h(-1)) after induction of anesthesia and anesthetized with 1 MAC isoflurane. S100B levels in cerebrospinal fluid were determined before aneurysm clipping and 0, 2, 4 h after aneurysm clipping by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Assessment of mean blood flow velocity of parent arterial and arterial branches were performed before and after aneurysm clipping. RESULTS: (1) S100B in cerebrospinal fluid was increased significantly at 4 h after aneurysm was clipped in group A (F = 4.11, P < 0.05). However, S100B in cerebrospinal fluid was stable in group B in the whole procedure. (2) Mean arterial flow velocity of parent vessels in group B was lower significantly than that in group A (t = 2.08, P < 0.05). However, mean arterial flow velocity of distal vessels in both groups has no significant difference. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative nimodipine infusion may prevent cerebral vasospasm during intracranial aneurysm surgery.
