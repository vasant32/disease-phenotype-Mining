The ability of cancer cells to undergo invasion and migration is a prerequisite for tumor metastasis. Rho, a Ras-related small GTPase, and the Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinases (Rho kinases, ROCK1 and ROCK2) are key regulators of focal adhesion, actomyosin contraction, and thus cell motility. Inhibitors of this pathway have been shown to inhibit tumor cell motility and metastasis. Here, we show that fasudil [1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-homopiperazine], an orally available inhibitor of Rho kinases, and its metabolite 1-(hydroxy-5-isoquinoline sulfonyl-homopiperazine) (fasudil-OH) modify tumor cell morphology and inhibit tumor cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. In addition, we show that fasudil inhibited tumor progression in three independent animal models. In the MM1 peritoneal dissemination model, tumor burden and ascites production were reduced by > 50% (P < 0.05). In the HT1080 experimental lung metastasis model, fasudil decreased lung nodules by approximately 40% (P < 0.05). In the orthotopic breast cancer model with MDA-MB-231, there were 3-fold more tumor-free mice in the fasudil-treated group versus saline control group (P < 0.01). Fasudil has been approved for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm and associated cerebral ischemic symptoms. In patients, fasudil is well tolerated without any serious adverse reactions. Therefore, the concept of Rho kinase inhibition as an antimetastatic therapy for cancer can now be clinically explored.
