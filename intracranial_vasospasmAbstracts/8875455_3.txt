Endothelial cells are affected in the cerebral vasospasm that occurs at the time of erthyrocyte lysis in a subarachnoid clot. A red blood cell lysate was added to bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells in vitro to determine whether hemolysate can trigger tyrosine kinase mediated cell signalling and if so, whether this signal is independent of the elevation of intracellular free calcium levels, [Ca2+]i induced by hemolysate. Hemolysate was found by Western blotting to induce a dose dependent increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins, approximately 60 and 110 kD, that was maximal between 1 and 2 min. The biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i induced by hemolysate consists of a peak complete within 1 min which is the result of release of intracellular calcium stores and a plateau phase due to an influx of extracellular Ca2+. Addition of hemolysate to cells in the presence of EGTA indicated that an extracellular Ca2+ influx is not required for the increases in tyrosine phosphorylation. Release of intracellular Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin, a Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, was, however, found to increase the phosphotyrosine content of the same 60 and 110 kD proteins. Endothelial cells pretreated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, tyrphostin 25 or genistein, before exposure to hemolysate blocked the plateau phase of the [Ca2+]i response indicating that tyrosine kinase activity is required for the influx. Ca2+ and phosphotyrosine mediated cell signalling induced by hemolysate in endothelial cells may be activated by a single component but represent distinct targets for possible control of the cerebral vasospasm response.
