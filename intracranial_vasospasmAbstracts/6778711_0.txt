Experiments on anesthetized and unanesthetized cats and examination of 42 neurosurgical patients have shown that nitroglycerin considerably increases cerebral and peripheral circulation, raises the pressure in the internal jugular vein and brain ventricles, increases the lumen of cerebral vessels of predominantly minor caliber, speeds up the linear and volumetric rate of the cerebral blood flow. Nitroglycerin induces a decrease in the systemic arterial and perfusion pressure. No species differences in the manifestations of the nitroglycerin pharmacological effect confirmed in the principle the common organization of the adrenergic mechanisms that control the cardiovascular system. Nitroglycerin is effective for prevention and therapy of cerebral angiospasms.
