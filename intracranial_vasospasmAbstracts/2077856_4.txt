NPY is a putative neurotransmitter mainly co-localized with noradrenaline in sympathetic fibers which innervate the cerebral vasculature. The origin of most of the perivascular NPY fibers seems to be in the superior cervical ganglion. To investigate involvement of Neuropeptide Y (NPY) mechanisms in subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), twenty patients with SAH were investigated. NPY-LI (-like immunoreactivity) levels in the external jugular vein were assessed using radioimmunoassay in blood samples collected post-operatively (or after SAH in non-surgical patients) on days 1,2,3, 5,7 and 9. These levels were compared with the clinical course and blood flow velocity changes monitored with ultrasonic Doppler equipment from both middle cerebral arteries (MCA) and both internal carotid arteries (ICA). Compared to NPY-LI levels in 14 controls (mean 116 +/- 3 pmol/1), increased levels (up to 253 pmol/l) and a close relationship between velocities and NPY-LI levels were found in a subpopulation of the SAH patients. When comparing the mean haemodynamic index (V MCA/ipsilateral V ICA) and mean NPY-LI levels in each of the 20 patients, a correlation of r = 0.75, p = 0.0001 was found. Increased NPY-LI were found (131 +/- 8 pmol/l) when simultaneous Doppler velocity recordings showed vasoconstriction (Haemodynamic index greater than 5) compared with samples taken when the haemodynamic index was less than 5, p less than 0.05. When MCA velocity exceeded 120 cm/sec. increased levels were found (129 +/- 9 pmol/l) compared with the conditions when MCA velocity was less than 120 cm/sec (113 +/- 5 pmol/l), p = 0.06. The results indicate a possible NPY involvement in cerebral vasoconstriction after SAH.
