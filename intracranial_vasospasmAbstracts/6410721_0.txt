Digital intravenous angiography was used for the documentation and evaluation of cerebral vasospasm secondary to acute ruptured aneurysm. Attenuation of vessel caliber and/or generalized poor visualization of intracranial arteries and prolongation of circulation time were observed in seven patients with the acute clinical diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm. Posttreatment intravenous angiography demonstrated improvement in both arterial caliber and circulation time in six patients who responded to medical therapy for vasospasm. Digital intravenous angiography allowed repeat investigations of the intracranial vasculature safely and quickly without undue risk to the critically ill patient.
