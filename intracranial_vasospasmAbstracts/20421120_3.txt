The rat double-SAH model is one of the standard models to simulate delayed cerebral vasospasm (CVS) in humans. However, the proof of delayed ischemic brain damage is missing so far. Our objective was, therefore, to determine histological changes in correlation with the development of symptomatic and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) proven CVS in this animal model. CVS was induced by injection of autologous blood in the cisterna magna of 22 Sprague-Dawley rats. Histological changes were analyzed on day 3 and day 5. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed by PWI at 3 tesla magnetic resonance (MR) tomography. Neuronal cell count did not differ between sham operated and SAH rats in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex on day 3. In contrast, on day 5 after SAH the neuronal cell count was significantly reduced in the hippocampus (p<0.001) and the inner cortical layer (p=0.03). The present investigation provides quantitative data on brain tissue damage in association with delayed CVS for the first time in a rat SAH model. Accordingly, our data suggest that the rat double-SAH model may be suitable to mimic delayed ischemic brain damage due to CVS and to investigate the neuroprotective effects of drugs.
