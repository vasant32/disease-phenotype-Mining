 BACKGROUND: cerebral vasospasm (CVS) is one of the most considerable complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The aim of this study was to assess and to compare the ability of intrathecal dotarizine and nimodipine to prevent and treat vasospasm in a rabbit model of subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHOD: thirty male New Zealand white rabbits weighing 2,500-3,000 g were allocated into five groups randomly. The treatment groups were as follows: Control, only SAH, SAH/Dotarizine, SAH/Nimodipine, SAH/Vehicle. Forty-eight hours after SAH injection, all animals underwent femoral artery catheterization procedure by open surgery under anesthesia and angiography performed for each animal in the fifth day just before sacrifice. FINDINGS: basilar artery vessel diameters are measured by angiography. Basilar artery vessel diameters and luminal sectional areas are measured in pathology slides. There was a statistically significant difference between the mean basilar artery cross-sectional areas and the mean arterial wall thickness measurements of the control and SAH-only groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: these findings demonstrate that calcium channel blocker dotarizine has marked vasodilatory effect in an experimental model of SAH in rabbits. Nimodipine is an effect-proven agent in CVS, but dotarizine may take place of it.
