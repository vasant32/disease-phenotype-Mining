Recently, an important role of platelet-activating factor (PAF), an inflammation mediator, has been demonstrated in the genesis of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In the current study, the authors examined whether intravenous administration of the novel PAF antagonist, E5880, can prevent vasospasm following SAH in rabbits. A vasospasm model was produced in three groups of rabbits using two subarachnoid injections of autologous arterial blood, followed by intravenous administration of distilled water (control), a low dose of E5880 (0.1 mg/kg in distilled water), or a high dose of E5880 (0.5 mg/kg in distilled water). Neurological deterioration was largely prevented in the rabbits that received E5880. Basilar artery constriction was also reduced by both doses of E5880. Histological examination at autopsy predominantly showed ischemic changes in the brain. Animals in each E5880-treated group exhibited ischemic changes less frequently than those in the control group. Plasma thromboxane B2 concentrations were reduced in rabbits treated with E5880. Platelet-activating factor was immunolocalized in the intima and media of the basilar artery in the control group. The PAF immunoreactivity demonstrated in the basilar artery was decreased in the E5880 groups in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, this study provides evidence that PAF may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm after SAH and that intravenous administration of E5880 is a promising approach in preventing vasospasm.
