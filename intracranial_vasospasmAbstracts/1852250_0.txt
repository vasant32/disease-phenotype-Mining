The pathogenesis of delayed traumatic vasospasm is not yet fully understood. We present six cases of delayed traumatic symptomatic vasospasm along with CT scan and angiographic findings. The cases ranging in age from 16 to 78 years all had head injury caused by traffic accidents. The Glasgow coma scale on admission was 9 - 15 except in one severe case GCS 6. Initial CT scans were obtained on the day of injury in four patients and on the 2nd and 3rd days in the other two cases respectively. There was no distinct subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the Sylvian cistern was observed with particular care in all patients. However the severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage was mild (isodensity or slight high density by CT) in 4 cases. Brain contusions on CT scan were observed in the temporal and/or frontal region of 5 of 6 patients. Ischemic symptoms occurred during the period between 5 and 13 days after head injury. The cerebral angiogram taken after the occurrence of these symptoms revealed spasms in all patients, the spasm being bilateral in 2 of them. Spasms were recognized on the main arteries at the base of the brain such as C1, M1, M2 and A1. In 5 cases, the cerebral contusion and the spasm were located on the same side. Angiographically the vasospasms lasted 2 to 5 weeks. The prognosis based on the Glasgow outcome scale was good recovery in 3 patients and moderate disability in one. Two elderly patients with bilateral spasms were in a vegetative state and severe disability, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
