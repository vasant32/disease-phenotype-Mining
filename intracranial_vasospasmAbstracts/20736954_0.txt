Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) affects approximately 27,000 Americans per year. Although delayed cerebral vasospasm is of high clinical significance, mortality within the first 2 days may approach 30%. In this issue of the Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism, Lee et al have studied the role of iron in early brain injury after experimental SAH. They found that iron chelation with deferoxamine reduced mortality and oxidative DNA damage, and lessened the induction of iron-handling proteins. Taken together, these results highlight the deleterious potential of blood breakdown products and provide an insight into future intervention.
