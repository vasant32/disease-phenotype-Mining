OBJECTIVE: A drug delivery system using copoly(lactic/glycolic acid) was developed for the intracranial administration of papaverine. A rod-shaped implant prepared by a heat compression method was tested to determine its efficacy in preventing cerebral vasospasm in dogs. METHODS: Sixteen dogs were randomly assigned to one of two groups, i.e., placebo or papaverine. Control angiography was performed, followed by right craniectomy and the induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage by the placement of a clot in the Sylvian fissure. Two pellets, containing either 25 mg of papaverine or no papaverine, were placed in the cistern. In in vitro studies, 56% of the actual papaverine loading was released in the first 4 days and 78% within 8 days. On Day 7, angiography was repeated and the animals were killed. A similar experiment using low-dose pellets containing 5 mg of papaverine, half of which was released within 7 days, was performed with 16 mongrel dogs. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the papaverine- and placebo-treated groups in the reductions of vessel diameters of the internal carotid, middle cerebral, and anterior cerebral arteries on the clot side. The mean concentration of papaverine in the clot was 4.5 x 10(-4) mol/L. The low-dose pellet failed to prevent cerebral vasospasm, although the mean concentration of papaverine in the clot was 2.3 x 10(-5) mol/L. CONCLUSION: A prolonged-release preparation of papaverine that could be implanted intracranially at the time of surgery prevented vasospasm significantly while maintaining an appropriate concentration of papaverine in the cistern.
