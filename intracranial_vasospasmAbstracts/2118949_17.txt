The authors describe a method for Doppler ultrasound recording of flow velocity in the basilar artery of normal rabbits and rabbits with experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). With this transcranial Doppler (TCD) model, clinical assumptions regarding flow velocity/cerebral blood flow (CBF) relationships, autoregulatory responses, and Doppler spectral waveform analysis can be tested under controlled conditions and compared with established methods of CBF measurement (hydrogen clearance). The time course of changes in flow velocity following SAH (cerebral vasospasm) is successfully demonstrated using the experimental TCD method. There are significant differences in the flow velocity and CBF responses to hypercapnia, hypocapnia, and trimethaphan-induced hypotension which indicate that TCD cannot be considered a simple alternative to CBF measurement for the study of cerebrovascular reactivity and cerebral autoregulation.
