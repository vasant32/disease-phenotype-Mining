Many patients survive aneurysmal SAH with minimal neurological deficits, but are at risk for developing further neurological insult from ischemia resulting from cerebral vasospasm. Nimodipine has proven to be effective in preventing this complication in a majority of patients studied, with hypotension the most severe adverse effect. Nimodipine alone, or in combination with other methods of therapy, may significantly improve the neurological outcome in this select patient population.
