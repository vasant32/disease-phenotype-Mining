Mounting evidence suggests that chronic cerebral vasospasm may be linked to the inflammatory response that follows subarachnoid hemorrhage. Twenty-one patients judged to be at high risk for vasospasm because of either poor admitting grade or a large amount of subarachnoid blood shown by computed tomography were treated with a course of high dose methylprednisolone, and management results were compared to those of a cohort of contemporary control patients matched for grade, number of hemorrhages, time from hemorrhage to admission, time from hemorrhage to operation, aneurysm location, age, and sex. Patients treated with high dose methylprednisolone were twice as likely to have an excellent result and half as likely to die as those who were not treated. The incidence and severity of delayed cerebral ischemia were reduced in treated patients when compared to control patients. None of the treated patients developed a serious side effect that could be attributed to steroid treatment. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that chronic vasospasm is an inflammatory vasculopathy and suggest that early treatment with high dose methylprednisolone may benefit this high risk group of patients.
