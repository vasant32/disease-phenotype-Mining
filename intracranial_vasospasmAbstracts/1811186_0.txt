This paper describes the methods of prevention of delayed neurological deficit (DND) in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) due to ruptured intracranial aneurysm. To prevent the decrease in the cerebral flow, vasodilators, inhibitors of platelet aggregation and synthesis of endogenous prostaglandins, stimulators of prostacyclin synthesis of its analogue should be applied. It is also recommended to use the inhibitors of phosphodiesterase, blockers of serotonin and of calcium channel (particularly nimodipine). Therapy with the immunosuppressive drugs helps to prevent DND. With all those therapeutical methods DND is still a serious complication following SAH.
