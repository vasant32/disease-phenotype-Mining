Experiments were made in cats to study the morphological and functional state of the capillary system of the brain in response to adrenaline administration and stimulation of the sympathetic cervical nerve under conditions of prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibition. In the presence of indomethacin administration there occurs potentiation of the vasoconstrictor effect of noradrenaline as well as of stimulation of the sympathetic nerve although to a less extent. It is assumed that the effect of exo- and endogenous noradrenaline on cerebral microcirculation is related to a definite measure to prostaglandin endogenous biosynthesis whose inhibition may lead to potentiation of the adrenergic effects thereby creating a risk of cerebrovascular spasms. Evidence for adrenergic control at the level of the capillary system of the cerebral cortex is discussed.
