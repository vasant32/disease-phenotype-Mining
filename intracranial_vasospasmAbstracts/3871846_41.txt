Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2) were measured by positron emission tomography (PET) in four patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and hemiparesis due to cerebral vasospasm. With resolution of the vasospasm, two patients recovered and two remained hemiparetic. Contralateral to the hemiparesis, rCBF was slightly higher in the two patients who eventually recovered (15.0 and 16.2 ml/100 gm/min) than in the two who remained hemiparetic (12.0 and 11.7 ml/100 gm/min). The rCMRO2 measurements showed similar differences, with values of 1.34 and 2.60 ml/100 gm/min in the patients who recovered, and 0.72 and 1.66 ml/100 gm/min in those who did not. These preliminary findings indicate that with PET studies it may be possible to prospectively differentiate patients with neurological deficits due to reversible ischemia from patients with irreversible infarction.
