We showed that normovolaemic induced hypertension therapy was effective in reducing ischaemic symptoms attributed to cerebral vasospasm in 41 patients after subarachnoid haemorrhage. By inducing hypertension to 25% to 50% above normal systolic arterial blood pressure, we observed that in 17 of 24 cases (71%) neurological deficits improved. In four cases of haemorrhagic infarction, the blood pressure rose to over 50% of systolic arterial pressure, and a low density area was confirmed on computerized tomography (CT) scan prior to vasospasm. Induced hypertension was therefore not considered when a low density area was revealed on CT scan. Restriction of fluid input is usually a factor in producing hypovolaemia after a neurosurgical operation. Intravascular volume expansion has been reported effective in reversing ischaemic deficits. However, according to Poiseuille's equation, increasing blood volume to a state of hypervolaemia can not enhance flow. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) was raised by increasing perfusion pressure, reducing viscosity, or increasing blood vessel diameter. Intravascular volume expansion elevates not only systemic arterial pressure, but also pulmonary artery wedge pressure over 18 mmHg and cardiac index over 2.2. Since pulmonary oedema and congestive heart failure may develop, one should monitor haemodynamic parameters with the Swan-Ganz catheter as a preventive measure. We emphasize that normovolaemic induced hypertension, maintaining haemodynamics subset 1 of the comparable haemodynamic subsets, is effective in raising perfusion pressure of CBF.
