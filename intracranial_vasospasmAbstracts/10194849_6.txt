Continuous monitoring of cerebral metabolism would be desirable for early detection of vasospasm in SAH patients. Bedside-microdialysis, a new technique for on-line monitoring of cerebral metabolism, may reflect changes seen in cerebral vasospasm diagnosed by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD). This report represents the first case of combined TCD monitoring and on-line microdialysis from the brain extracellular fluid in a SAH patient. A 48-year-old woman suffered subarachnoid hemorrhage grade IV according to Hunt and Hess. Angiography revealed an aneurysm of the left carotid artery. The aneurysm was clipped 45 hours after bleeding. The microdialysis catheter was inserted after aneurysm clipping into the white matter of the left temporal lobe. Sampling of microdialysates started immediately, analyzing time for glucose, lactate, pyruvate and glutamate was four minutes. Postoperatively, the patient was doing well and microdialysis and TCD parameters remained within normal range. On the third postoperative day a shift to anaerob metabolism (decrease of glucose, increase of lactate and the lactate-pyruvate ratio up to pathological levels) and an increase in glutamate was observed suggesting insufficient cerebral perfusion. The patient progressively deteriorated clinically. Vasospasm was diagnosed by TCD monitoring 36 hours after onset of ischemic changes monitored by microdialysis. After elevation of mean arterial blood pressure, TCD values and metabolic parameters normalized. Interestingly, the pathological changes in on-line microdialysis preceded the typical increase in blood flow velocity by TCD and the clinical deterioration. Our case suggests, that bedside-microdialysis may be useful for early detection of vasospasm and continuous surveillance of treatment and may be a new guide to treat ischemic neurological deficits following SAH.
