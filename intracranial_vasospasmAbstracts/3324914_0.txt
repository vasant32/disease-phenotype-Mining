Sonotomography, associated with the Doppler test, permits an atraumatic exploration of quite a satisfactory precision of the carotid and vertebral arteries in their cervical portion. This type of exploration was used in patients with parietal lesions of these vessels, arterio-venous malformations or a cerebral arterial spasm. In these lesions of the wall and lumen of the arteries, the problem is to reconsider the place of this examination as compared to arteriography with injection of contrast material, from the diagnostic as well as pre-therapeutic standpoint.
