In nine cases of bradycardiac arrhythmia of less than 50 bpm that arose during cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal rupture the patients were treated by temporary pacing. In patients with cerebral vasospasm, in whom autoregulation of the cerebral circulation is impaired, bradycardia aggravates the risk of decreased cerebral blood flow. This study demonstrated that temporary pacing is an effective and safe procedure in maintaining heart rate during vasospasm.
