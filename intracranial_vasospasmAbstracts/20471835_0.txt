Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has a crucial role in the onset of hemolysis-induced vascular injury and cerebral vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that TNF-alpha measured from brain interstitial fluid would correlate with the severity of vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). From a consecutive series of 10 aSAH patients who underwent cerebral microdialysis (MD) and evaluation of vasospasm by CT angiogram (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), TNF-alpha levels from MD were measured at 8-hour intervals from aSAH days 4-6 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An attending neuroradiologist blinded to the study independently evaluated each CTA and DSA and assigned a vasospasm index (VI). Five patients had a VI<2 and 5 patients had a VI>2, where the median VI was 2 (range 0-13). The median log TNF-alpha area under the curve (AUC) was 1.64pg/mL *day (interquartile range 1.48-1.71) for the VI<2 group, and 2.11pg/mL *day (interquartile range 1.95-2.47) for the VI>2 group (p<0.01). Thus, in this small series of poor-grade aSAH patients, the AUC of TNF-alpha levels from aSAH days 4-6 correlates with the severity of radiographic vasospasm. Further analysis in a larger population is warranted based on our preliminary findings.
