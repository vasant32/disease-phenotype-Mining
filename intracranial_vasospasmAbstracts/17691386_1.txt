Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a well established therapy in the treatment for chronic pain. SCS has also been shown to increase peripheral blood flow and is now an accepted treatment in the management of ischemic limb pain and angina. There is a growing body of evidence that cervical spinal cord stimulation also increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) in both animal and human models. SCS could potentially impact on the treatment of cerebral vasospasm and stroke by an increase in CBEF The utility of SCS is also being explored in novel applications such as adjunctive tumor therapy, where resistance to therapy conferred by tissue hypoxia may be ameliorated by CBF augmentation.
