Spontaneous disappearance of an intracranial aneurysm after subarachnoid hemorrhage is an uncommon event and usually associated with severe cerebral vasospasm, giant aneurysms or the use of antifibrinolytics. We present a young woman who suffered a grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage with severe vasospasm caused by a small anterior communicating artery aneurysm. The patient underwent a slow recovery and two years later requested surgery. Angiography demonstrated complete disappearance of the aneurysm. The neurosurgeon should be aware that spontaneous thrombosis of cerebral aneurysms can occur and ensure that angiography is repeated when surgery is significantly delayed.
