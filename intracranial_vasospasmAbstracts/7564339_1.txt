We examined the responses to intraluminally applied acetylcholine (ACh) in isolated and perfused canine basilar arteries by the stainless-steel cannula-inserting method. In control vessels with intact endothelium, ACh produced a slight vasodilatation followed by a long-lasting vasoconstriction in the absence of induced tone. Propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, had no effect on the response to ACh. After endothelial removal with intraluminal saponin, the constrictor component of the response to ACh was significantly enhanced, and the constrictions to prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and potassium chloride (KCl) were significantly potentiated. After exposure to extraluminal oxyhemoglobin, the ACh-induced constriction was significantly augmented, whereas the dilator component of the response to calcium ionophore A23187 was significantly attenuated. The enhanced constriction to ACh after endothelial removal was significantly blocked by OKY-046 (a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor) and nimodipine (a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist), but was slightly though not significantly suppressed by AA-861 (a lipoxygenase inhibitor). The response to PGF2 alpha was not altered by OKY-046 or AA-861. These results suggest that the potentiation of ACh-induced constriction after endothelial removal may be mediated in part by thromboxane A2 (TXA2), linked with extracellular calcium entry in smooth muscle cells (SMC). This mechanism might be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
