In vitro experiments were performed using a small volume chamber to study serotonin-induced contractions of the canine basilar artery. Temperature was found to have a profound effect on the artery's response to serotonin. Raising the temperature to 40 degrees C (104 degrees F) increased the maximum response by 20% and lowering the temperature by 10 degrees C caused a 40% reduction in the maximum contraction. Cumulative log-dose response curves for analogues of serotonin demonstrated a high degree of specificity for the serotonin receptor and large nonphysiological concentrations of serotonin caused relaxation of the contracted artery. Extracellular calcium was shown to be an absolute requirement for serotonin-induced contractions. Extracellular magnesium, in contrast, was shown to inhibit serotonin-induced contractions.
