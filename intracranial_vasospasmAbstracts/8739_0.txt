Basing on prior investigations, the site of action of an alpha-adrenergic substance liberated by platelets, which elicit cerebral vasospasm, was precisely located experimentally in white mice. It could be shown, that this substance incites the alpha-receptors of the smooth muscle cells, because the depletion of catecholamines in the postsynaptic nervous fibres by Tyramine does not abolish the capability for cerebral vasospasm. Furthermore could be shown, that stimulation of beta-receptors by Isoproterenol can inhibit the vasospasm completely.
