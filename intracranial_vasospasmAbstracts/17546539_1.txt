Non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (NSAH) is a benign form of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The angiographic changes of cerebral vasospasm (CVS) are uncommon in patients with this type of SAH. NSAH is uniformly associated with an excellent outcome without associated rebleeding or symptomatic CVS. We report a patient with NSAH who developed severe and diffuse CVS. He was treated with transluminal balloon angioplasty because he has been refractory to conventional treatment measures for CVS.
