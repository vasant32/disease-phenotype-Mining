 BACKGROUND: The individual difference of cerebral vasospasm (CVS) degree after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is common in clinic observation. Numerous studies have found that early CVS after SAH is associated with derangements in catecholamine (CA) metabolism. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a key rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation of CA. In this study, we investigate the correlation between COMT gene polymorphism of patients and early CVS after SAH. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-seven patients with spontaneous SAH in early stage were selected in this study. COMT genotyping was performed by means of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The degree of CVS was identified by TCD. Hunt-Hess classification was used to evaluate the severity of the patients' condition. The bleeding amount was evaluated by means of Fisher classification of head CT. Ï‡2 test (SPSS13.0 software) and logistic regression were adopted to analyze the correlation of COMT gene polymorphism and other clinical data of patients with early CVS after SAH. RESULTS: The distribution of each allele matched Hardy-Weinberg law and research samples were heredity equilibrium population. Early CVS incidence of patients with COMT-A allele was much higher than those with COMT-G allele (P<0.01). Early CVS incidence of patients with COMT A/A genotype was obviously higher than those with COMT G/G genotype (P<0.05). Univariate logistic regression demonstrated that COMT-A allele, A/A genotype and Grade 3-5 of Hunt-Hess classification were all associated with early CVS. After adjustment of general information, further multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that COMT-A allele, A/A genotype were risk factors of early CVS after SAH. CONCLUSION: COMT-A allele, A/A genotype were risk factors of early CVS after SAH.
