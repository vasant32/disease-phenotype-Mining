Inhibitors of dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) administered intraperitoneally were shown to prevent spasm of the basilar artery caused by blood application in cats. A low or nondetectable blood DBH activity level may be related to the absence of spasm. In several instances, however, moderate spasm did occur with a low blood DBH activity level. Possible mechanisms for these findings are discussed.
