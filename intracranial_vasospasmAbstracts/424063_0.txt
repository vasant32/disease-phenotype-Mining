1. The present study analysed the clinical course, the serial angiograms and the CT scans of the patients with angiographic arterial occlusion following vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The occlusion was observed in 6 out of 84 patients with vasospasm. 2. The angiograms which showed this phenomenon were obtained between the 11th and the 30th day of the illness. The affected vessels were the branches of middle cerebral artery. 3. Thrombus formed on the intima which had been injured by vasospasm is suspected to be a genesis of this arterial occlusion. The pathological findings of a case in this series support this concept. 4. The surgical procedure during the direct aneurysmal operation performed in the period of "smooth narrowing" seems to be a contributing factor to the arterial occlusion. There was no correlation between antifibrinolytic therapy and this phenomenon except in one case. 5. Fibrinolytic therapy after clipping of aneurysm may be a treatment of choice for this arterial occlusion following vasospasm.
