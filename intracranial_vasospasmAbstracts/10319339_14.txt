The involvement of de novo nitric oxide synthase (NOS) induction in the development of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was examined using a rat model of SAH. SAH was induced by endovascular perforation with Nylon thread. The rats were killed at different time intervals, from one day to seven days after endovascular perforation. Inducible NOS messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the distribution of iNOS positive cells was immunohistochemically examined. In the vascular tissue with a subarachnoid membrane, iNOS mRNA was expressed from one day to seven days after SAH. Inducible NOS positive cells were mainly recognized in the vascular tissue, but not in the brain parenchyma. The distribution of nitrotyrosine, an indicator of peroxynitrite production was also examined immunohistochemically and nitrotyrosine-positive cells were observed almost at the same sites of iNOS induction. To determine the role of iNOS in the development of cerebral vasospasm, we measured the diameter of the middle cerebral artery in animals either treated or not treated with aminoguanidine (AG), a selective inhibitor of iNOS. AG ameliorated the vasoconstrictive change after SAH. These results are thus considered to provide molecular and immunohistochemical evidence showing that iNOS expression following SAH and NO produced by iNOS can develop cerebral vasospasm after SAH.
