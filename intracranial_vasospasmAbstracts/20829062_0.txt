Inflammatory responses have been implicated in the elaboration of several forms of central nervous system injury, including cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A critical event participating in such responses is the recruitment of circulating leukocytes into the inflammatory site. CD34 is a key adhesion molecule responsible for recruitment of monocytes/macrophages and the attachment of leukocytes to endothelial cells. However, it has not been investigated whether, and to what degree, CD34 is induced by SAH and also the role of CD34 in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm following SAH remains unknown. Experiment 1 aimed to investigate the timecourse of the CD34 expression in the basilar artery after SAH. In experiment 2, we chose the maximum time point of vasospasm (day 3) and assessed the effect of monoclonal antibody against CD34 on regulation of cerebral vasospasm. As a result, the elevated expression of CD34 was detected in the basilar artery after SAH and peaked on day 3. After intracisternal administration of CD34 monoclonal antibody, the vasospasm was markedly attenuated after blood injection on day 3. Our results suggest that CD34 is increasingly expressed in a parallel time course to the development of cerebral vasospasm in a rat experimental model of SAH and administration of the specific CD34 antibody could prevent or reduce cerebral vasospasm caused by SAH.
