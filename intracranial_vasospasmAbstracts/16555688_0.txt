Clazosentan, an endothelin ETA antagonist, is under development by Actelion (formerly Axovan), under license from F Hoffman-La Roche, for the potential prevention of cerebral infarction and ischemia induced by cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Results from the phase IIb portion of a phase IIb/III clinical study are expected in the first half of 2006.
