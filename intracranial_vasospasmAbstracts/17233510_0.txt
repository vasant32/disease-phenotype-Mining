This study investigated nonspecific behaviors as early indications of vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although symptoms of vasospasm (e.g., lowered level of consciousness, focal deficits such as hemiplegia or aphasia), are well recognized, the significance of early appearance of nonspecific symptoms such as restlessness, unusual behaviors, and impulsive behavior has not been investigated in detail. The study design included descriptive quantitative elements and a small qualitative component. Nonspecific behaviors were recorded, and the prevalence of those behaviors in individuals developing vasospasm was noted. Of 60 participants, 31 developed vasospasm; 24 of the 31 initially presented with nonspecific behaviors (p < .0001). Early detection of cerebral vasospasm allows prompt intervention and treatment, with the goal of preventing further ischemia or infarction.
