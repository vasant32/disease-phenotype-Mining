BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A reduction in the local availability of nitric oxide (NO) may play a role in the etiology of chronic cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We investigated the toxicity and efficacy of a locally delivered NO donor from a controlled-release polymer in preventing experimental cerebral vasospasm in rats and rabbits, respectively. METHODS: Diethylenetriamine/NO (DETA/NO) was incorporated into controlled release ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVAc) polymers. Twenty-eight rats were used in a dose-escalation toxicity study to establish a maximally tolerated dose of DETA/NO-EVAc polymer. In the efficacy experiment, 20 rabbits were assigned to 4 experimental groups (n=5 per group): sham operation; SAH only; SAH+empty EVAc polymer; and SAH+DETA/NO-EVAc polymer. Treatment was initiated 30 minutes after blood deposition. Basilar artery lumen patency was assessed 72 hours after hemorrhage to evaluate the efficacy of DETA/NO in preventing cerebral vasospasm. RESULTS: In the toxicity study, a dose of 3.4 mg/kg was identified as the LD(20) (dose with 20% mortality during the study period) of this DETA/NO formulation. Brain histology revealed hemorrhage and ischemic changes at the implantation site associated with high concentrations of DETA/NO. In the efficacy study, treatment with DETA/NO-EVAc polymer resulted in a significant decrease in basilar artery vasospasm compared with no treatment (93.0+/-4.9% versus 71.4+/-11.9%; P=0.035) or compared with treatment with blank EVAc polymer (93.0+/-4.9% versus 73.2+/-6.4%; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Local delivery of DETA/NO prevents vasospasm in the rabbit basilar artery. Local delivery of DETA/NO via polymers is a safe and effective strategy for preventing cerebral vasospasm after SAH in this model.
