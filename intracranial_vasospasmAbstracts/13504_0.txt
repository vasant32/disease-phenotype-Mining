An understanding of the physiology of vascular smooth muscle and knowledge of the reaction of such muscle to certain drugs are essential for the development of a means of treating cerebral arterial spasm. The role of cyclic nucleotides in vascular smooth muscle activity is reviewed and possible therapeutic approaches are listed. Probably the safest and most effective treatment would be 1) stimulation of the adenyl cyclase-cyclic adenosine monophosphate system by a beta(2)-adrenergic drug combined with 2) inhibition of the phosphodiesterase system.
