1 The pharmacological similarity between human basilar artery and a number of isolated tissues (rat colon, anococcygeus, stomach fundus and aorta and guinea-pig ileum and colon) has been assessed during investigations of the aetiology of cerebral arterial spasm. 2 The responses of each of the six tissues to human normal and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to human serum were compared with those of the human isolated basilar artery. 3 These studies revealed the presence of a vasodilator factor in CSF from subarachnoid haemorrhage patients and several tissues may be of use for further work in identifying the vasoactive substances in CSF. 4 No tissue displayed exactly the same spectrum of biological reactivity as the human basilar artery. The rat stomach fundus showed the closest similarity and was further studied for similarities in drug-induced responses. 5 The rat stomach fundus, like the human basilar artery, was contracted by 5-hydroxytryptamine, prostaglandin F2alpha and histamine and relaxed by dopamine. However, noradrenaline relaxed the fundus but contracted the basilar artery.
