The effect of experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on the adrenergic innervation and on the 45Ca2+ uptake of cat cerebral arteries was analyzed. Intracisternal injections of autologous blood reduced the noradrenaline content of perivascular nerve endings and 3H-noradrenaline uptake. These values returned to normal levels in a period of two weeks after SAH. The activity of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase was also reduced 3 and 7 days after SAH. Superior cervical gangliectomy and intracisternal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine also reduced these three parameters. The uptake of 45Ca2+ by arteries from animals submitted to SAH was greater than if the blood vessels were from untreated cats. Lantanum brought about a less 45Ca2+ displacement in the arterial segments from untreated animals than in those from cats after SAH. These results suggest that SAH induces a transient adrenergic denervation as well as changes in the membrane of smooth muscle cell which increase the quantity of Ca2+ bound to it. All these modifications might be involved in the cause of chronic cerebral vasospasm that appears after SAH.
