Phencyclidine (PCP) abuse is reaching alarming proportions. PCP has recently been shown to induce hypertensive encephalopathies, microvascular cerebrovasospasm and acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Since we have shown in vitro that cerebral vasospasms induced by PCP could be completely reversed, or prevented, by use of organic calcium antagonists, we utilized a television microscope recording system to determine whether magnesium ions (Mg2+) could inhibit the ability of PCP to induce contraction of pial arterioles and its sequelae of microvascular damage. Administration of either MgCl2 or Mg aspartate HCl, i.a. or i.v. (1, 10, and 20 mumol/min), before or after administration of PCP produced dose-dependent inhibition (30-80%) of PCP-induced arteriolar spasms and the subsequent vascular damage. A variety of pharmacologic receptor antagonists and cyclooxygenase inhibitors failed to influence PCP-induced cerebrovasospasms. These data suggest that a naturally-occurring Ca2+ antagonist, viz. Mg2+, may be useful in the treatment of PCP intoxication and its cerebral vascular consequences.
