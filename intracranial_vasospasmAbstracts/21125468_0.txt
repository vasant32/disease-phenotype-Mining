 BACKGROUND: we investigated the clinical efficacy of intra-arterial administration of fasudil hydrochloride for cerebral vasospasm. METHOD: we reviewed 90 cases treated with intra-arterial administration of fasudil hydrochloride between August 1998 and April 2009 and investigated the clinical efficacy for cerebral vasospasm. FINDINGS: angiographic improvement of vasospasm was noted in all procedures. Eight had ischemic lesion on CT at discharge in Group A, which included 39 patients who presented angiographic and symptomatic vasospasm. However, 4 (50%) of these eight were recovered with a condition of GR. No patients showed ischemic lesion on CT in Group B, which included 51 patients who presented angiographic vasospasm without symptoms. Two (3.3%) of 59 patients who presented angiographic vasospasm without symptoms at the initial follow-up angiography had ischemic lesion on CT at discharge. The 1-year follow-up showed 78.9% of GR. No patient showed any adverse effects resulting from intra-arterial administration of fasudil hydrochloride. CONCLUSION: intra-arterial administration of fasudil hydrochloride was an effective and safe management technique for vasospasm.
