1. Late cerebral arterial spasm was induced by repeated injections of autologous blood in a total amount of 14-33 ml into the basal cisterns of baboons to mimick subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), sagittal sinus pressure, cerebral arterial caliber from angiograms, and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were measured before and after the experimental SAH to determine responses to hypercapnia and induced hypertension. The effect of the calcium antagonist, Nimodipine, on CBF autoregulation pre- and post-SAH was tested. 2. One week after the blood injections were started there was about 10-20% reduction, depending on territory measured, in the arterial diameter of the carotid and vertebral systems. This was associated with an 18% reduction in CBF and 9% decrease in the brain metabolism. 3. During hypercapnia before and after experimental SAH the flow increased with a mean of 3.7 and 1.8 ml, respectively, for each mm Hg elevation of PaCO2. In control animals, graded angiotensin-induced hypertension did not overtly affect CBF. Following SAH, the CBF autoregulation was impaired in 5 of 6 animals tested. 4. I.v. infusion of Nimodipine markedly curtailed the CBF autoregulation in pre-SAH animals and, to a somewhat slighter extent, also in post-SAH animals.
