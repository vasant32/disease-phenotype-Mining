Four patients presented with ruptured intracranial aneurysms during pregnancy. Problems encountered during the management of these cases included delayed diagnosis, obstructive hydrocephalus, cerebral ischemia due to vasospasm and recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage. Recent advances in the management of ruptured intracranial aneurysms, including early computerized tomographic scanning, intravascular volume expansion and induced hypertension for the management of cerebral vasospasm, and the timely obliteration of the aneurysm are applicable to the subarachnoid hemorrhage patient even if her condition is complicated by pregnancy.
