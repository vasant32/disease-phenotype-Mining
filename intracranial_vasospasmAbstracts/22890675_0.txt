Delayed cerebral vasospasm is a main cause of morbidity and mortality as well as poor outcome in patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In this study, the effect of the bronchodilator KMUP-3 (7-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzene)piperazinyl]ethyl]-1,3-dimethylxanthine) on basilar artery narrowing, neurological outcome, and expression of rhoA/rho kinase II (ROCKII), rhoA, and protein kinase C (PKC) γ proteins were evaluated in a rat model of SAH. SAH was induced by double injection of autologous blood into the cistern magna on days 0 and 3. KMUP-3 was administered (0.3 mg/kg/day) by osmotic minipumps implanted subcutaneously (beginning day -3 in pretreatment group and at 1 h after the initiation of the first autologous blood injection in the treatment group). Neurological outcome was assessed by ambulation and placing/stepping reflex responses at 48 h after the second injection of autologous blood. Tissue morphology and protein expression were conducted on day 7 post-day 0 injection. Both KMUP-3 treatment regimens significantly improved neurological outcome and completely attenuated basilar artery narrowing as well as reduced the enhancement of ROCKII, rhoA, and PKCγ protein expression in rats subjected to SAH, compared with normal and untreated SAH rats. These results suggest that KMUP-3 may be a novel agent for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm following SAH.
