1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-homopiperazine, HA1077, is a calcium antagonist with anti-vasospastic properties. This compound blocks intracellular actions of calcium in a variety of experiments. In the present study, we examined the effects of HA1077 on the vascular actions of endothelin, an endothelium-derived vasoactive peptide, in dogs in vitro and in vivo. Intracisternal injections of endothelin (0.01 nmol) produced a significant vasospasm, as measured by angiography, similar to that seen in the canine hemorrhage model. Infusion of HA1077 led to a significant dilatation of the spastic basilar artery in endothelin-treated dogs. The rank order of in vitro contractile activity in canine cerebral arteries was a stable thromboxane A2 analog greater than endothelin greater than 5-hydroxytryptamine greater than prostaglandin F2 alpha greater than histamine greater than noradrenaline. HA1077 effectively antagonized the endothelin-induced contraction of canine basilar arterial strips in both calcium-containing and calcium-free medium. The present results indicate that HA1077 is an effective antagonist for endothelin in vitro and in vivo.
