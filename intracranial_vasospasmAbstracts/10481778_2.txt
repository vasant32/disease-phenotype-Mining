OBJECTIVE: To report the early clinical results, quantitative angiographic and sonographic findings, and final outcome in patients with symptomatic vasospasm who had undergone surgical occlusion of the aneurysm and a structured protocol including aggressive intensive care management, endovascular procedures (EP), and barbiturate coma (BC). RESULTS: Thirty consecutive patients (19 women, 11 men, age: 51 +/- 8 years) underwent 38 EP for the treatment of 81 vascular territories (15 balloon dilatations and 66 papaverine infusions). Overall angiographic vasospasm in the intradural ICA improved significantly from 44.7 +/- 19.8% to 16.5 +/- 16%, in the MCA from 44.2 +/- 14.7% to 14.4 +/- 14%, and in the ACA from 38.7 +/- 18.6% to 13.3 +/- 12%. Mean flow velocities (Vm) in the MCA and ACA decreased significantly from 135 +/- 48 cm/sec to 87 +/- 32 cm/sec and from 110 +/- 36 cm/sec to 84 +/- 30 cm/sec, respectively. No significant Vm improvement in the ICA could be demonstrated. Six patients (20%) developed intractable vasospasm after repeated EP and five patients underwent BC. The correlation coefficient between percentage of angiographic vasospasm and Vm increase was -0.19 (p = NS) for the ICA, 0.2 (p < 0.001) for the MCA, and 0.3 (p < 0.05) for the ACA. Correlation coefficient between percentages of angiographic and sonographic improvement was -0.12 (p = NS) for the ICA, 0.42 (p < 0.001), and 0.1 (p < 0.05) for the ACA. Early clinical improvement after EP was observed in 73% of patients and was significantly associated with favourable outcome (GOS 4-5). Sixteen patients (53%) had a GOS 5, six patients (20%) a GOS 4, six patients (20%) a GOS 3, and two patients (6.6%) died as consequence of devastating vasospasm. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in vessel diameter and increases of Vm during vasospasm correlate weakly. In spite of the fact that significant differences in vessel diameter and Vm were demonstrated after treatment, a moderately good correlation between percentages of angiographic and Vm improvement was observed only in the M1 segments. In our experience, a reduction of mortality and disabilities can be achieved with a maximal structured treatment of vasospasm. Early clinical improvement after endovascular treatment is strongly associated with favourable outcome, nevertheless, cost-benefit and controlled trials are necessary to evaluate these techniques.
