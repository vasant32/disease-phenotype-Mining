This study was performed as part of a series of investigations into the relation between cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage and the sympathetic nervous system. We studied the effect of phenoxybenzamine chloride (POB) and prazosin hydrochloride (Prazosin) on the cerebral vasoconstriction in the basilar arteries of cats induced by application of oxyhemoglobin (Oxy-Hb), noradrenaline (Nor) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). Adult cats were anesthetized with intramuscular pentobarbital and maintained on a respirator through a tracheostomy. By the transclival approach, a bone window was formed in the clivus, and the dura was opened, exposing the basilar artery. A cannule was inserted into the subarachnoid space, and through it, Oxy-Hb, Nor and PGF2 alpha were injected. The sequential changes in caliber of the basilar artery were measured using photography. First, we determined the doses of POB and Prazosin necessary for decreasing the vasoconstriction induced by Nor, and 20 mg/kg of POB and 10 mg/kg of Prazosin were found to decrease the vasoconstriction induced by 10(-3) M Nor, statistically. Second, we investigated the effect of 20 mg/kg of POB and 0.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of Prazosin on the cerebral vasoconstriction induced by Oxy-Hb or PGF2 alpha. POB (20 mg/kg) was infused for 2 hours before the application of Oxy-Hb or PGF2 alpha. Prazosin was given intravenously. In the first group, 0.02% Prazosin (0.5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously for 1.5 hours before the application of Oxy-Hb or PGF2 alpha. In the second group, 1.5 hours elapsed between the beginning of Prazosin (10mg/kg) infusion and the application of Oxy-Hb or PGF2 alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
