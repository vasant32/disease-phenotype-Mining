Experiments were performed on isolated human cerebral arteries to evaluate the role desensitization and tachyphylaxis might play in preventing certain agonists from producing prolonged vasoconstriction after subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition, the antiproteases leupeptin and pepstatin were studied to ascertain whether these peptides might inhibit contraction as does antithrombin III. The maximal contraction to KCl was used as a standard for comparing the responses elicited by the agonists, the decay of the responses to the agonists over 15 minutes was used as an index of desensitization, and the percentage of decrease in response to a second application of the agonist over the first was a measure of tachyphylaxis. The results showed that desensitization and tachyphylaxis greatly reduced or abolished the contractile responses to norepinephrine, serotonin, angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin, substance P, neuropeptide Y, neurotensin, thrombin, uridine triphosphate, linoleic acid, melittin, and cathepsin D. Moreover, some arteries failed to respond to some of these agonists, and no contractile response was elicited by acetylcholine or bradykinin. In contrast, prostaglandins E2, D2, and F2 alpha, as well as plasmin, produced sustained contractions, without tachyphylaxis, but only prostaglandin E2 and plasmin produced contractions at concentrations of 10(-7) M or less that were comparable to those of KCl. None of the antiprotease peptides inhibited the responses to KCl whereas small concentrations (6 X 10(-8) M) of antithrombin III did. The results support the hypotheses that the phenomenon of desensitization and tachyphylaxis would prevent many diverse agents from acting as spasmogens and that substances like antithrombin III present in the cerebrospinal fluid after hemorrhage could immediately protect patients from cerebral vasospasm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
