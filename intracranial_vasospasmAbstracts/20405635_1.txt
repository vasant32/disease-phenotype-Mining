The aim of the study was to assess the possible correlation between catecholamine and cortisol levels and changes in cerebral hemodynamics in patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study included 50 patients with chronic PTSD first ever hospitalized for psychiatric treatment and 50 healthy control subjects. All study subjects were aged 30-50. In PTSD patients, 24-h urine levels of the epinephrine and norepinephrine metabolites vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and cortisol were determined and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was performed on day 1 of hospital stay and repeated after 21-day psychiatric medicamentous treatment. On initial testing, increased level of 24-h VMA, decreased cortisol level and elevated mean blood flow velocity (MBFV) in the circle of Willis vessels were recorded in 25 (50.00%) patients. Repeat findings obtained after 21-day psychopharmaceutical therapy showed increased 24-h VMA, decreased cortisol and elevated MBFV in the circle of Willis vessels in seven (14.00%) patients (initial vs. repeat testing, P = 0.0002). Such parameters were not recorded in any of the control subjects (initial PTSD patient testing vs. control group, P = 0.0000). Study results pointed to a significant correlation between increased catecholamine levels, decreased cortisol level and elevated MBFV in the circle of Willis vessels caused by cerebral vasospasm. Psychiatric medicamentous therapy administered for three weeks significantly reduced the proportion of patients with concurrently altered cerebral hemodynamics, increased levels of catecholamine metabolites and decreased level of cortisol.
