Body fluid gas pressure and electrolytes of patients with ruptured aneurysm were continuously analyzed. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was regulated at the level of 120-100 mm H2O by cerebral ventricular drainage. There was no significant change in the pH, PCO2, HCO3-, Na+, K+, Ca++ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with slight or moderate disturbance of consciousness (lethargic-drowsy state). The PcsfO2 of the patients with marked disturbances of consciousness (semicoma-coma) was significantly low. PcsfO2 of the patients with cerebral vasospasm was significantly lower than for those without vasospasms. PcsfO2/PaO2 was 0.27 +/- 0.01 in the patients with vasospasm and 0.50 +/- 0.01 in those with vasospasm. PcsfO2 tended to decrease in patients with markedly bloody CSF. When the bloody CSF was cleared by ventricular drainage, PcsfO2 increased. PcsfO2 did not return to a normal value in the patients with marked disturbances of consciousness despite sufficient arterial oxygen tension. This suggests that PcsfO2 and PcsfO2/PaO2 should provide a convenient index for the prognosis of patients with ruptured aneurysm.
