The syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP syndrome) is a life threatening, severe complication of pre-eclampsia with typical laboratory findings. An unusual case of a 36-year-old woman with HELLP syndrome and the initial complication of intracerebral haemorrhage is presented. The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome was confirmed by elevated liver enzymes, low platelets, increased total bilirubin and increased lactate dehydrogenase. The intracranial haematoma was removed with good neurological recovery ensuing. However, this case was complicated by cerebral vasospasm on the eleventh day, confirmed by cerebral angiography and computer tomographic findings. The patient died from brain swelling. Possible vasospam should be considered during the treatment of patients with HELLP syndrome.
