Serial transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) studies were carried out in 61 patients, who had been operated due to supratentorial brain tumours. Among 61 cases have been 26 gliomas, 19 meningiomas and 16 metastases. The Mean Flow Velocity (MFV) exceeding 120 cm/s in Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) and 90 cm/s in Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) has been admitted as pathognomonic for vasospasm. The vasospasm has been stated in 14 cases (23%)--10 gliomas and 4 meningiomas out of 61 patients. The vasospasm has been more intense in ACA on the operated (lesion) side than in MCA and on the non operated (opposite) side.
