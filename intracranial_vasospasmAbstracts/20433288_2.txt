BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of levosimendan to prevent cerebral vasospasm in a rabbit model of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). ANIMALS AND METHODS: Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits were allocated into three groups randomly. SAH was induced by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna. (Group 1 = control:sham surgery group, Group 2 = SAH alone group, Group 3 = SAH plus levosimendan group). Histopathological examination was performed on day 3 as described. Intravenous levosimendan dose (initially 12 microg kg(-1) infusion, continuously for at least 10 minutes and then continued with a dose of 0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) treatment was started after the induction of SAH. Three days later, the animals were sacrificed. RESULTS: In pathological investigation; there was statistically significant difference in luminal area and muscular wall thickness of the basilar artery between all groups (p < 0.005). Malondialdehyde level was also found significantly low in the levosimendan group compared with the SAH group. CONCLUSION: Intravenous levosimendan treatment was found effective by increasing the pathological luminal area and reducing muscular wall thickness measurements. This is the first study to show that intravenous administration of levosimendan is effective in preventing cerebral vasospasm induced by SAH in rabbits.
