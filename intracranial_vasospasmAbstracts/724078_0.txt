Time relationship between the presence of vasospasm on angiography and the onset of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was investigated with 797 direct surgical cases with intracranial saccular aneurysm. It has been said that vasospasm would occur in early days after the onset of SAH. But in this paper, in the cases with only one history of SAH, vasospasm occurred within 3 days after SAH was seen in only 4.2% of the 120 cases. The peak of vasospasm on angiography was seen in the period between 10 and 17 days after SAH. During this period vasospasm was seen in 49.1% of the 116 cases. Meanwhile, in the cases with preceding SAH occurred between 1 and 17 days before the onset of the last SAH, vasopasm occurred within 3 days after the last SAH was seen in 38.7% of the 62 cases. On the contrary, during the period between 10 and 17 days after the last SAH, vasospasm was seen in only 20% of the 25 cases. Preceding SAH occurred between 1 and 17 days before the last SAH seemed to be responsible for the high rate of vasospasm within 3 days after the last SAH and the low rate of vasospasm in the period between 10 and 17 days after the last SAH.
