Cerebral vasospasm is the major cause of delayed ischemia in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The Fisher grading scale has been used to predict patients in risk of developing vasospasm. Improved radiological techniques and treatment may have changed the relevance of the Fisher scale. We have now evaluated the Fisher scale, Hunt and Hess and age in relation to outcome in patients with SAH. Eighty- three patients were admitted with SAH during two years, and 84 aneurysms were treated in 78 patients. The Glasgow outcome score (GOS) within 3 months were as follows; GOS 1 (19%), GOS 2 (2%), GOS 3 (11%), GOS 4 (9%), GOS 5 (59%). There was a significant correlation between both the Fisher grading scale, Hunt and Hess scale and outcome. Age was not correlated to the Fisher grading scale or the Hunt and Hess scale. Age was also not correlated to outcome in our patients. Despite the correlation to outcome both Hunt and Hess and the Fisher grading scale had a limited predictive value of outcome due to a low specificity and/or sensitivity.
