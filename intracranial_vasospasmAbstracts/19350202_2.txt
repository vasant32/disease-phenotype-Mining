BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasospasm triggered by subarachnoid haemorrhage is one of the major causes of post-haemorrhage morbidity and mortality. Several treatment modalities have been proposed, and none of them are fully effective. METHODS: In this study we treated five patients with prostacyclin suffering vasospasm after a ruptured aneurysm not responding to high i.v. doses of nimodipine. All patients were severely ill, unconscious and in need of intensive care. FINDINGS: A low dose of prostacyclin i.v. infusion for 72 h reversed the vasospasm as measured by transcranial Doppler technique. The mean MCA blood flow velocity decreased from 199 +/- 31 cm/s to 92 +/- 6 cm/s within 72 h after the start of the prostacyclin infusion. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that low-dose prostacyclin treatment, an old treatment strategy, can be a treatment option in patients with vasospasm not responding to ordinary measures.
