OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of the novel endothelin A (ETA) receptor antagonist clazosentan in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and its potential to reduce the incidence and severity of cerebral vasospasm following surgical clipping of the aneurysm. METHODS: This Phase IIa multicenter study had two parts: a double-blind, randomized Part A (some patients given clazosentan [0.2 mg/kg/hr] and others given placebo), in which statistical inference was performed, and an open-label Part B (patients with established vasospasm given clazosentan [0.4 mg/kg/hr for 12 hours followed by 0.2 mg/kg/hr]) for exploratory purposes only. Primary end points were the incidence and severity of angiographic vasospasm on Day 8 after SAH and the safety and tolerability of the drug. Thirty-four patients (Hunt and Hess Grades III and IV and Fisher Grade > or = 3) were recruited and 32 (15 in the clazosentan group and 17 in the placebo group) were retained in the intent-to-treat population; 19 patients entered Part B. In Part A, treatment with clazosentan resulted in a reduced incidence of angiographically evident cerebral vasospasm (40% compared with 88% of patients, p = 0.008). In addition, the severity of vasospasm was reduced in the clazosentan group (p = 0.012). In Part B of the study, in 50% of assessable patients who were initially treated with placebo reversal of vasospasm was observed following the initiation of clazosentan therapy. The incidence of new infarctions was 15% in the clazosentan group and 44% in the placebo group (p = 0.130). There was no adverse event pattern indicating a specific organ toxicity of clazosentan. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that clazosentan reduces the frequency and severity of cerebral vasospasm following severe aneurysmal SAH with the incidence and severity of adverse events comparable to that of placebo.
