Experimental delayed cerebral vasospasm was produced in a two-hemorrhage canine model. The spastic basilar artery was exposed via the transclival route under a surgical microscope and was dilated by the topical application of 1-(5-chloronaphthalenesulfonyl)-1H-hexa-1,4-diazepine (ML-9), a selective antagonist of myosin light chain kinase. Dilation was dose-dependent, with a median effective dose (+/- standard deviation) of 51.4 +/- 6.9 microM. In addition, 50 microM of ML-9 was injected into the cisterna magna until the intracranial pressure (ICP) reached 200 mm H2O for 30 minutes, including a complete reversal of angiographic delayed vasospasm in three of seven dogs; in contrast, 150 microM of ML-9 was infused at 1.52 ml/min into the vertebral artery for 30 minutes, producing little dilation of the spastic basilar artery. In another study, the intracisternal perfusion of 50 microM of ML-9 at 1.48 ml/min for 30 minutes in dogs with an ICP of less than 200 mm H2O produced no serious electroencephalographic abnormalities, and the mean arterial blood pressure and pulse rate remained normal; no neurological deficits or significant histological abnormalities ascribable to the intracisternal ML-9 were found.
