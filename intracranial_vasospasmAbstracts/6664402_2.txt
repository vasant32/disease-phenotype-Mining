Operative findings of degenerative changes in pituitary adenomas are not uncommon; however, clinical apoplexy is rare. We report the case of a 43-year-old man who presents a sudden right hemiplegia with aphasia and right ophthalmoplegia, in relation with an ischemic pituitary apoplexy and cerebral vasospasm. A few cases of arterial obstruction or vasospasm associated with pituitary apoplexy have been reported in the literature. Cerebral arterial spasm has also been observed after pituitary surgery. Inclusion of blood or necrotic material in the subarachnoid space seems not to be the only mechanism of vasospasm. The role of hypothalamic dysfunction is considered.
