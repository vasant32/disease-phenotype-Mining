The Study on the treatment of 50 cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage (by applying beta-receptor blocking drug propranolol) and the control group of 55 cases revealed that the mortalities of the therapeutic group and the control group were respectively 4% and 9.2% (P less than 0.05) the incidences of the cerebral vasospasm were 2% and 10.6% (P less than 0.01) and those of the abnormal electrocardiograms were 6% and 21.8% (P less than 0.01). The differences between the two group were significant. The function of propranolol may be associated with the sudden increase of catecholamine after subarachnoid haemorrhage and there for the drug has the function of protection of the cardiac muscle and prevention of the cerebral vasospasm.
