BACKGROUND: Vasospasm caused by intracranial hypertension in head injury remains controversial. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2004, we prospectively and consecutively performed conventional cerebral angiography for six patients with head injuries who showed persistent intracranial hypertension (over 20 mm Hg for longer than 5 days) despite performing various treatments for intracranial hypertension. RESULTS: All subjects had a minor hemorrhage at admission, classified as Fisher group 2. Five of the six patients had angiographically confirmed vasospasm, and one of them later developed a cerebral infarction. Four of the five subjects who exhibited cerebral vasospasm had undergone hypothermic therapy to control the intracranial hypertension. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that persistent intracranial hypertension that is treated by hypothermic therapy may be related to late phase cerebral vasospasm.
