 AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the effects of a strong dithiol     antioxidant, alpha lipoic acid (ALA) on cerebral vasospasm following     subarachnoid hemorrhage in a rabbit model. MATERIAL and METHODS: Twenty-one New     Zealand white rabbits were assigned to one of three groups: group 1 (control),     group 2 (SAH only), group 3 (SAH+ALA). ALA was administered (100 mg/kg/day,     single dose, intraperitoneally). The rabbits were sacrificed 72 hours after SAH.     The basilar artery lumen areas, arterial wall thickness and endothelial     apoptosis in a cross section of basilar artery were measured in all groups. The     tissue MDA, SOD, GSH-Px levels were also determined. RESULTS: The elevated     tissue MDA levels after SAH were significantly reduced by ALA treatment. The     reduced tissue SOD and GSH-Px levels after SAH were also elevated by ALA     treatment. In the treatment group the average wall thickness and the mean     percentages of apoptotic cells (apoptotic index) were reduced and the average     cross-sectional areas of the basilar artery were increased statistically     significantly. CONCLUSION: ALA treatment attenuates the severity of cerebral     vasospasm by its strong antioxidant, antivasospastic and antiapoptotic     properties. ALA may potentially serve as agents in the prevention of cerebral     vasospasm after SAH.
