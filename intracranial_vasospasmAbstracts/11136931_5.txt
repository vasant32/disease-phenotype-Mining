BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been suggested that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The present study was undertaken to explore the inhibitory effect of U0126, a novel MAPK inhibitor, in the contraction of the rabbit basilar artery by 3 spasmogens: hemolysate, oxyhemoglobin, and bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with vasospasm. METHODS: The contraction and relaxation of rabbit basilar arteries were measured by isometric tension. MAPK immunoprecipitation was assessed by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: (1) Pretreatment of the rabbit basilar arteries with U0126 reduced contractions to hemolysate, oxyhemoglobin, or bloody CSF applied subsequently. (2) In the absence of endothelial cells, U0126 produced an inhibitory effect similar to the contractions induced by hemolysate, oxyhemoglobin, or bloody CSF. (3) U0126 relaxed the sustained contraction induced by hemolysate, oxyhemoglobin, or bloody CSF. (4) Hemolysate, oxyhemoglobin, and bloody CSF enhanced MAPK immunoprecipitation. (5) U0126 reduced MAPK immunoprecipitation induced by hemolysate, oxyhemoglobin, and bloody CSF. (6) Hemolysate, oxyhemoglobin, and bloody CSF significantly increased MAPK activity in the rabbit basilar artery. (7) U0126 abolished the effect of hemolysate, oxyhemoglobin, or bloody CSF on MAPK activation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a role of MAPK in the contraction of rabbit basilar arteries by hemolysate, oxyhemoglobin, and bloody CSF. MAPK inhibitor U0126 may be useful in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm.
