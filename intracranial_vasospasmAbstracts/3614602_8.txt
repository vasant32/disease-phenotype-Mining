Based on accumulating evidence of the role of xanthine oxidase (XO) in generating oxygen free radicals and causing tissue damage during ischemia, we examined the possible role of XO in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). After inducing SAH in dogs by two autologous blood injections 2 days apart, chronic vasospasm of the basilar artery was reliably produced. There was a 3.5-fold elevation in uric acid (UA), the product of XO, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these animals. Parenteral administration of allopurinol (i.v., 25 mg/kg, every 6 hours), a specific blocker of XO, successfully abolished the elevation in CSF uric acid levels due to SAH. However, angiographic vasospasm measured on Day 7, morphological changes observed by electron microscope, and elevated CSF prostaglandin levels were not altered by the treatment. It can be concluded that the observed activation of the enzyme XO, which is a well-known source of oxygen free radicals in ischemia in various organs, is not playing a major role in the pathogenesis of chronic cerebral vasospasm in this animal.
