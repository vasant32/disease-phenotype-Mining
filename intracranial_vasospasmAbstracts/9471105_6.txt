Alterations of the endothelium may play a role in the generation of cerebral vasospasm. The objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of the endothelium and of endogenous endothelin (ET) on the NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG)-induced contractions in isolated rat basilar arteries. L-NOARG, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl esther, and methylene blue, but not D-NOARG, induced concentration-dependent contractions and spontaneous vasomotion. The effect of L-NOARG was reversed by L-arginine and submaximally reduced in de-endothelialized arteries. The contractile effect of L-NOARG was completely suppressed by the ET-antagonists BQ 123 and Ro 46-2005 in a part of the basilar arteries. After washout of the respective antagonist, the L-NOARG-induced contraction started, but was not influenced by a second application of the antagonist. In another part of preparations the antagonists failed to influence the L-NOARG-induced contraction. Inconsistent suppressor effects were also observed after preincubation with ketanserin, Manning compound, losartan, or indomethacin. None of these antagonists reversed the established L-NOARG-induced contraction. Thus, endothelium-derived NO suppresses spontaneous contraction and vasomotion in rat basilar arteries. Endogenous ET, 5-HT, vasopressin, angiotensin or cyclooxygenase metabolites do not cause the contraction induced by inhibition of the NO synthase, but may act as 'trigger factors', that may play a role in rat models of cerebral vasospasm or infarction.
