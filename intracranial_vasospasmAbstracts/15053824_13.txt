1. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and inflammation in the development of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of AVP in the arterial narrowing following cerebral haemorrhage by examining the effect of SR 49059 (a V(1) receptor antagonist) on the diameter of rat basilar artery exposed to SAH. The effect of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor ZM 230487 on AVP-induced contraction of rat basilar arteries was also investigated. 2. After 1 h and 2 days from SAH induction, brains were removed and pictures of the basilar arteries were taken. The external diameter of the basilar artery was measured in the presence and absence of SR 49059 (1 mg/kg, i.v.). For in vitro experiments, the basilar arteries isolated from control and SAH rats (at 1 h and at 2 days from SAH induction) were cut into spiral preparations and the AVP (0.3 nmol/L)-induced contraction in the presence of ZM 230487 was investigated. Each group analysed (i.e. control, SAH 1 h and SAH 2 days) consisted of eight rats. 3. The diameter of rat basilar arteries decreased by 43 and 25% at 1 h and 2 days from SAH induction, respectively, compared with control. The administration of SR 49059 significantly reduced cerebral vasospasm. After SAH induction, the diameter of the basilar artery in SR 49059-treated groups decreased by only 22% (at 1 h) and by 3% (at 2 days) compared with the control group (P < 0.01). In basilar arterial strips, ZM 230487 attenuated the vasopressin-induced contraction in both control and SAH groups. However, SAH groups showed a significant resistance of the AVP-induced contraction in the presence of ZM 230487 compared with control (P < 0.05). 4. The results suggest that the cerebral vasospasm in SAH rats is due, at least in part, to endogenous AVP and may involve an increase in the activity of 5-lipoxygenase. SR 49059 may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm.
