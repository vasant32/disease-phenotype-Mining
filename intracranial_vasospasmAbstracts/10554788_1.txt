The pathogenesis of cortical blindness as a rare complication in severe preeclampsia is still unclear. The case of a women with postpartum blindness is reported in which CT and MRI initially showed cortical and subcortical edema in the parieto-occipital lobes. At this time cerebral angiography and transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) revealed widespread cerebral vasospasm. Mean blood flow velocities in the middle and posterior cerebral artery and carotid syphon initially reached 380 cm/s and normalized within 2 weeks. While the patient's vision improved rapidly, follow-up MRI disclosed ischemic lesions and petechial hemorrhage in the occipital cortex. This case provides rare documentation that transient blindness in patients with preeclampsia may result from parieto-occipital ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm. In such patients TCCS may be useful to detect vasospasm associated with preeclampsia/eclampsia.
