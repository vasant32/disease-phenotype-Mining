OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of nimodipine and papaverine (Pap) on the spastic arteries with delayed cerebral vasospasm (DCVS) in dogs. METHODS: A model of DCVS in dogs was induced by the cisterna magna injections of fresh autologous blood twice. The diameter of the basilar arteries with and without DCVS was measured with the aid of a JVC operative microes cope in vivo after nimodipine and Pap were directly placed around the arteries. RESULTS: The dilation of the basilar arteries was obviously induced by application of nimodipine and Pap in the dogs without DCVS no dilation was induced by application of nimodipine and slight dilation by application of Pap but in those with DCVS. CONCLUSION: The cerebral blood flow is improved by the effect of nimodipine on non-spastic arteries. Pap has been found to reverse slightly the narrowing of the basilar arteries with DCVS and to dilate the arteries without DCVS, but the vasodilation effect is transient.
