The efficacy of the 21-aminosteroid U74006F was investigated using different dosages in a restricted, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Forty cynomolgous monkeys were divided into five groups of eight. There were two groups given treatment with placebos, one being saline and the other the vehicle in which U74006F was delivered. There were three U74006F treatment dosage groups: 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg. Each monkey underwent baseline cerebral angiography followed by right-sided craniectomy and subarachnoid placement of a clot around the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Treatment was administered intravenously every 8 hours for 6 days. Seven days after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage, angiography was repeated, and the animals were killed. In both saline or vehicle placebo treatment groups, significant vasospasm (VSP) occurred on the clot side in the extradural internal carotid artery (C3), the intradural internal carotid artery, the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral artery (A1,) and the MCA (P less than 0.01). After U74006F treatment, significantly less VSP developed in the A1 on the clot side (0.3 mg/kg U74006F treatment group) and the MCA (all U74006F treatment groups, P less than 0.05). When the percentages of change from the baseline for the vessel diameters on the clot side were compared, VSP was attenuated in the A1 (P less than 0.05) and MCA (P less than 0.001) of all U74006F treatment groups as compared with the placebo treatment groups. Only 0.3 mg/kg of U74006F significantly prevented VSP in C3 (P less than 0.01). Although the 0.3 mg/kg dosage appeared to have the most favorable effect, no significant differences were observed among the three dosage groups. Electron microscopy of the MCA on the clot side in the animals treated with U74006F still showed luminal convolutions and morphological changes in the endothelial cells. These changes appeared less prominent in those MCAs with milder VSP. If these results in primates are applicable to humans, U74006F would be useful in reducing VSP after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
