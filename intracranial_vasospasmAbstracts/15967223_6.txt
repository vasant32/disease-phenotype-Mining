BACKGROUND: Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of endothelin-1 (ET-1) were measured in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after aneurysmal rupture and compared with levels of ET-1 in volunteers. We analyze the relationship between levels of ET-1 in both CSF and plasma with the risk of developing cerebral vasospasm (CVS). METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples were collected from 30 selected patients after SAH and from 10 healthy volunteers who were used as control. All samples were stored at -70 degrees C and the levels of ET-1 in CSF and blood were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. All patients were submitted to angiography to confirm vasospasm. RESULTS: From the 30 patients admitted at different days of SAH, 18 (60%) developed clinical CVS and 10 (33%) presented angiographic CVS. The levels of ET-1 in the CSF were significantly higher (P = .0001) in patients (1.618 +/- 1.05 fmol/mL) than in controls (0.365 +/- 0.328 fmol/mL). There was statistical difference (P < .05) in CSF levels of ET-1 between each group of the Hunt-Hess scale and controls. The mean plasma concentration of ET-1 was similar (P > .05) in the control group (1.531 +/- 0.753 fmol/mL) and in patients with SAH (1.920 +/- 1.15 fmol/mL). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a significant rise in ET-1 levels in the CSF, but not in the plasma, occurs in patients who develop CVS after SAH. Our observation suggests that ET-1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of SAH-associated CVS.
