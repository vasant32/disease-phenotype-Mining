Iloprost caused relaxation of rings of canine cerebral arteries precontracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha or the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619, but it was without effect on arteries precontracted with potassium chloride. Pretreatment with iloprost did not significantly affect the concentration-response curve to any agent. Contractile responses to oxyhemoglobin were completed relaxed by iloprost. In arteries from animals with moderate cerebrovascular spasm, the response to prostaglandin F2 alpha was also reduced by iloprost. The observation that iloprost relaxes the response to oxyhemoglobin to prostaglandin F2 alpha in spastic arteries may be of interest in the management of cerebral vasospasm.
