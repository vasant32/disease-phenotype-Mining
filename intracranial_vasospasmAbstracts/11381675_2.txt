The efficacy and safety of a new platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist, E5880, were investigated for preventing cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in 71 patients with SAH who underwent surgery for ruptured aneurysms within 3 days. Intravenous E5880 administration (300 micrograms or 1200 micrograms twice daily) was begun within 4 days and continued for 14 days. The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, low-density area on computed tomography, and angiographic vasospasm was lower than in placebo groups in previous studies. Clinical outcome was favorable compared with previous studies. No clinically important adverse events were observed. These results suggest that E5880 is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with cerebral vasospasm due to SAH.
