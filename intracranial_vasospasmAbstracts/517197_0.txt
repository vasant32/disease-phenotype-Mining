Vasoconstriction of the external carotid arteries, which has not been previously reported, was investigated angiographically in 23 patients who had intracranial vasospasm after aneurysm rupture. In about 50% of these patients vasoconstrictive change in the external carotid arteries was also found. These changes were not seen in control cases without intracranial vasospasm. Pathogenesis of the vasoconstriction of the external carotid arteries was discussed with particular emphasis on the relationship with sympathetic nerves.
