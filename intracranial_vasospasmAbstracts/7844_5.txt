In vitro experiments were performed using a small volume chamber to determine the contractile activity of several adrenergic agents on arteries from six locations of the canine vascular bed. Cumulative log-dose response curves were obtained for epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine and dopamine. It was found that the basilar and internal carotid arteries responded much less to these agents than did the mesenteric, renal and femoral arteries. Six blocking agents including nitroprusside were tested to determine their effect on the response of the canine basilar artery to log-dose additions of serotonin, prostaglandin F2alpha and KC1. Another chamber was developed to study the differential effect of nitroprusside and papaverine when placed on the luminal side versus the adventitial (cerebrospinal fluid) side of the basilar artery during a sustained contraction with serotonin. A theoretical treatment of cerebral arterial spasm following a subarachnoid hemorrhage is presented.
