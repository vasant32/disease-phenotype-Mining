The purpose of this study was to measure plasma platelet-activating factor (PAF) concentration, PAF-acetylhydrolase activities, anti-phospholipid antibody (aPLs) titers, and platelet function in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and to assess the association of these variables with the development of cerebral vasospasm. Thirty-two patients with SAH due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm were studied. Plasma PAF concentration, PAF-acetylhydrolase activity, platelet count and aggregability, and plasma factor 4 (PF4) concentrations were measured regularly until approximately 2 weeks after SAH. aPLs, including lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin IgG and IgM were measured within 3 days after SAH. Plasma PAF concentration in patients with SAH showed the highest value on the occasion during 5 to 9 days after SAH. The concentrations were higher in patients with infarction due to vasospasm than in patients without cerebral infarction on any occasions after SAH. Plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase activities did not change in patients, regardless of the presence of cerebral infarction after SAH. Increased platelet consumption and aggregability and higher concentrations of PF 4 were detected in patients with cerebral infarction and not in patients without cerebral infarction. The patients with cerebral infarction due to cerebral vasospasm had aPLs more frequently than the control volunteers. Our findings indicate that increased plasma PAF and aPLs may contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after SAH.
