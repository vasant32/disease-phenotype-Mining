Erythrocyte lysate increases intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and contracts cerebral arteries in vitro and has been suggested to be the cause for cerebral vasospasm. We investigated the effect of hemolysate on L-type Ca2+ channels directly by using patch clamp techniques in freshly isolated single smooth muscle cells from rat basilar artery. Patch clamp studies revealed a whole-cell current which resembles the L-type Ca2+ current reported by others. Hemolysate reduced the amplitude of the L-type Ca2+ channel current. The effect of hemolysate was reversible by washout and repeatable. Hemolysate was separated into two fractions by using filter membranes. The fraction > 1 kDa which contains oxyhemoglobin and other proteins mimicked the effect of hemolysate, while the fraction < 1 kDa and ATP were without effect. We conclude that hemolysate does not increase [Ca2+]i by activation of L-type Ca2+ channel.
