BACKGROUND: Transient cortical blindness is a rare complication of mild head trauma in children. This spectacular manifestation always has a benign outcome. CASE REPORT: A five-year-old girl was admitted for bilateral blindness immediately following a fall with frontal head injury. Neurological examinations and ophthalmological investigations showed no abnormalities. The electroencephalogram showed slow waves in the left occipital area. The blindness resolved completely within 3 hours. CONCLUSION: This bilateral blindness was similar to that of the 40 cases reported since 1964, including a rapid and benign outcome. Its mechanism is not clear, although some suggest a cerebral vasospasm. Our patient's mother has a history of migraine.
