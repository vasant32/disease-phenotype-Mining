a./Great regional differences were observed in the vasospastic effect of hemoglobin. Namely, hemoglobin was far more potent in the middle cerebral artery than in the mesenteric artery. b./The role of potassium ions as well as activation of calcium mobilizing adrenergic, serotoninergic and PGF2 alpha smooth muscle receptors were excluded in the mechanism of cerebral vasospasm induced by hemoglobin. c./First in the literature we showed that atropine significantly attenuates the vasospastic effect of hemoglobin, and hemoglobin releases peptidergic neurotransmitters and modulators from nerve terminals that are located in the adventitia of the middle cerebral artery.
