The present work was performed to establish whether the nonglucocorticoid, 21-aminosteroid, U74006F, could prevent the development of delayed cerebral vasospasm after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. The subarachnoid hemorrhage was produced by percutaneous injection of 4.5 mL of nonheparinized autologous blood into the cisterna magna of rabbits. U74006F (1 mg/kg) or placebo was injected intraperitoneally every 12 hours starting 12 hours prior to induction of hemorrhage for a total of six doses. The animals were sacrificed by perfusion fixation. The basilar artery was removed on day 2 and processed for morphometric analysis. Control/placebo and subarachnoid hemorrhage/placebo basilar artery diameters were 651.2 +/- 25.4 and 366.3 +/- 34.2 mu, respectively. Control/U74006F basilar artery diameters (669.8 +/- 21.8 mu) were not significantly different from that of the control/placebo group. U74006F treatment greatly minimized subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced reduction in mean luminal diameter (563.7 +/- 48.2 mu) (p less than 0.001). These results demonstrate considerable therapeutic promise for U74006F in the prevention of cerebral vasospasm.
