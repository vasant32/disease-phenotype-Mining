An update of published clinical advances in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage was provided. Searching MEDLINE using the search terms "cerebral vasospasm" and "clinical trials" 46 papers were identified that had been published since the International Conference on Cerebral Vasospasm in Istanbul, Turkey in 2006. Of these 26 were either safety studies or case reports leaving 20 papers for consideration. The major topics covered were calcium antagonists, magnesium sulphate, statins, and fasudil hydrochloride. The studies published did not reach an impact justified recommended routine use, but certainly as options. Results of the CONSCIOUS trials on endothelin receptor antagonists are awaited.
