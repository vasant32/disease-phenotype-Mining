Changes in cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation patterns in cerebral vasospasm might be underestimated if transcranial doppler sonography and angiography findings are considered singularly. This report describes preliminary findings in further development of a noninvasive method that estimates regional cerebral oxygenation and perfusion. A 50-year-old patient suffering from cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage before and after superselective papaverine infusion was examined. Measurements were taken by using a technique combining indocyaningreen dye dilution and near infrared spectroscopy. Our first results suggest that the technique could be suitable for estimation of cerebral hemodynamics. This noninvasive technique can be performed at the bedside and in special environments, such as neurocritical care units. It seems to be safe, easy to perform, and less time-consuming than conventional techniques. Combination of indocyaningreen dye dilution and near infrared spectroscopy might become a powerful tool in the detection and treatment of cerebral vasospasm causing delayed cerebral ischemic deficit. Further larger-scale investigations are necessary to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of this technique. Our preliminary observations however, based on measurements before and after superselective papaverine infusion in vasospastic vessels, helped to clarify the influence of extracerebral contamination on the cerebral near infrared spectroscopy signal in the adult head.
