Following subarachnoid haemorrhage, delayed cerebral ischaemia from cerebral vasospasm remains the most important cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with surgically secured aneurysms. Therapy with haemodilution, hypertension and volume expansion has been recommended to prevent and treat delayed cerebral ischaemia in these patients on the basis of uncontrolled clinical series (level of evidence III to V, grade C recommendation). Despite the lack of controlled studies, the maintenance of a cardiac index > 3.5 L.min-1.m-2 and a systolic arterial pressure between 120 and 150 mmHg before clipping and 160 to 200 mmHg thereafter is recommended as a prophylactic or therapeutic measure for vasospasm. Close monitoring of neurological and cardiorespiratory status is important to avoid neurologic and systemic complications.
