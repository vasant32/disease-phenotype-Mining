The results of our previous experimental and clinical studies led us to the hypothesis that, in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm, subarachnoid focal acidosis resulting from anaerobic changes of subarachnoid clots may be a factor upsetting the balanced synthesis of both thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin I2 from prostaglandin endoperoxides on the inner surface of cerebral arteries. Thus, there is a higher concentration of thromboxane A2, a prostanoid that causes arterial contraction and platelet aggregation. We tested the administration of trapidil, an antagonist and selective synthesis inhibitor of thromboxane A2, in a series of 20 cases for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm and cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal rupture. Vasospasm was demonstrated by angiography in 9 of these cases, but only 2 of the 9 showed mild signs of cerebral ischemia. Of the 20 patients, 15 were discharged from the hospital as cured and 3 had a neurological deficit at discharge. Our findings suggest the significance in symptomatic vasospasm of thrombus formation by platelet aggregation and the effectiveness of trapidil as a preventive.
