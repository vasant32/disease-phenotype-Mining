 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible therapeutic effects of clenbuterol on cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in rats. METHODS: Eighteen male albino Wistar rats, each weighing 200-250 g, were randomized into three groups; Group 1 (Control group) (n = 6) having no SAH and no treatment; Group 2 (Sham group) (n = 6) having only SAH and Group 3 (Experimental group) (n = 6) having SAH treated with clenbuterol. Group 2 has been accepted as sham group to the experimental group. Experimental SAH was induced using a modified rat double hemorrhage model. Clenbuterol was administered twice daily in 12-hour intervals for three days at a dose of 0,1 mg/kg/day. The luminal diameter of the basilar artery was measured on each section with an optic micrometer by an experienced pathologist blinded to the groups. RESULTS: Mean basilar artery diameters were found to be different between the three groups (p < 0.001). Mean value of Group 2 was significantly lower than that of Group 1 (p < 0.001). While mean value of Group 3 was significantly greater than that of Group 2 (p = 0.001), Groups1 and 3 were found to be similar (p = 0242). CONCLUSION: Clenbuterol has favorable effects in the treatment of rat cerebral vasospasm (CVS). Further investigations are needed to evaluate both molecular effects and to find out effective treatment dose of clenbuterol on CVS.
