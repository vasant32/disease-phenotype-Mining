2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2), a naturally occurring metabolite of estradiol, is known to have antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and antiproapoptotic activities. Mechanistically, 2ME2 has been shown to downregulate hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). We hypothesized that hypoxia in the major cerebral arteries might activate a unique signaling pathway, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), to produce or enhance cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Sprague-Dawley male rats (n = 70) were randomly divided into 5 groups: Sham operated, SAH without treatment, SAH treated with vehicle (DMSO), SAH treated with two HIF-1alpha inhibitors, 2ME2, and D609 (positive control of 2ME2). SAH model was produced by middle cerebral artery perforation. 2ME2 and D609 were administered intraperitoneal at 1 h after SAH; rats were sacrificed after 48 h of SAH. Thick blood clot was observed around basilar artery under arachnoids in all animals except Sham group; severe morphological vasospasm was observed in basilar arteries in SAH and SAH+DMSO rats, and the mild vasospasm in rats treated with 2ME2 and D609; 2ME2 and D609 reduced the activity of HIF-1alpha in the basilar arteries by HIF-1alpha DuoSet ELISA; reduce the expression of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNIP3 and PCNA in basilar arteries by Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. In addition, it decreased the mortality and improved the neurological deficits. In conclusion, 2ME2 is a powerful agent to reduce cerebral vasospasm by inhibiting HIF-1alpha activity and the expression of VEGF as its downstream, suppressing endothelium and VSMCs apoptosis via BNIP3 pathway, and attenuating vasoproliferation.
