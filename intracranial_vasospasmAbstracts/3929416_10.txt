Two representative cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage in which prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), stable metabolite of prostacyclin (PGI2), were monitored with serial lumbar punctures and detected in cisternal CSF during operations for aneurysm, are reported. In the case with demonstrated arterial vasospasm, prostaglandin D2 has a concentration trend with characteristic peak related to vasospasm; the synthesis of prostacyclin appears inhibited after the hemorrhage. In the patient without radiologic evidence of vasospasm, arachidonate metabolite concentration trend appears in a steady-state. Cisternal prostaglandin D2 concentration in the patient with demonstrated vasospasm is two times the highest lumbar CSF concentration, while 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha concentration is very low. This suggests the role of the clotting phenomenon and likely confirms the importance of arachidonate metabolites in the genesis of cerebral arterial spasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.
