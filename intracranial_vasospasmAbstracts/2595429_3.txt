We have described a patient with neurogenic hyperthermia caused by a diencephalic infarction. His hypothalamic dysfunction was a consequence of cerebral vasospasm from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Persistent elevation of body temperature did not respond to standard therapy, but successful treatment was achieved with cyproheptadine and indomethacin, presumably through antagonism of serotonin and prostaglandin activity.
