The authors provide grounds for the principles of pathogenic therapy aimed at posthemorrhagic cerebral vasospasm, proliferation-necrotic angiopathy with ensuing cerebral damage wherein free radical oxidation and antifibrinolytic therapy are of major importance. The efficiency of combined pathogenic therapy comprising antioxidants, chelators, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, calcium antagonists, barbiturate protectors, membrane-stabilizing and limiting antifibrinolytic hemostatic drugs is evaluated.
