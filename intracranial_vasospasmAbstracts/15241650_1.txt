Endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor, has been found to increase in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum of patients following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and to play a major role in the development of cerebral vasospasm. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of endothelin-A antagonist BQ-610 in the experimentally performed cerebral vasospasm following SAH. Thirty New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups (each n = 10): group A, control group; Group B, SAH group; Group C, treatment (endothelin antagonist BQ-610 treated) group. In the study, the rabbits developed vasospasm after injection of intracisternal autolog blood into the cisterna magna. After cerebral vasospasm development, in group C, endothelin antagonist BQ-610 was injected intracisternally. Morphometrically, basilar artery lumen was constricted 25% and 62% compared to the control group (group A) in the endothelin treated group (group C) and the endothelin untreated group (group B), respectively. Histopathological findings of the basilar artery wall confirmed the therapeutic effect of endothelin antagonist in vasospasm development. Endothelin-A receptor antagonist BQ-610 has a therapeutic effect in the cerebral vasospasm following experimentally performed subarachnoid hemorrhage when used intracisternally.
