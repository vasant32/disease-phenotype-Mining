Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), occurring with a delay of 4-10 days is linked to cerebral vasospasm (CVS), a pathological constriction of the cerebral arteries. Several agents have been suggested as being responsible - amongst these perhaps 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are the most prominent, given their ability to elicit powerful constriction of arteries. Investigating both 5-HT and ET receptors we observed distinct changes in the receptor phenotype after experimental SAH - namely upregulation of the ETB and 5-HT1B receptors - linked to a higher sensitivity to the endogenous agonists. This multiple receptor upregulation may explain the failure in treating CVS using single receptor antagonists, and may also significantly change our understanding of the effector mechanism behind CVS. So far only the ET and 5-HT receptors have been studied in this regard, but other receptor systems may also undergo changes.
