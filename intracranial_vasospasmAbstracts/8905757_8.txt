OBJECTIVE: Endothelial dysfunction is claimed to play a role in the pathogenesis of delayed cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We have examined the effect of experimental SAH on the modulatory action of endothelial and nonendothelial nitric oxide (NO) in the contractile response of goat middle cerebral artery to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). METHODS: We compared the 5-HT-induced contractile responses of cerebral arteries from control goats and from goats with SAH that had been experimentally induced 3 days earlier by delivery of autologous arterial blood into the subarachnoid space. Contractile responses were examined by recording the isometric tension in isolated cerebral arteries. To assess the influence of endothelium, this cell layer was mechanically removed in some of the arteria, segments (rubbed arteries) from both control goats and goats with SAH. RESULTS: In arteries from control goats, contractile responses to 5-HT were significantly higher in rubbed arteries than in arteries with intact endothelium; 5-HT-induced contractions were significantly enhanced by a competitive inhibitor of NO synthesis, NG-nitro-l-arginine, in arteries both with and without endothelium. In arteries from goats with SAH, 5-HT contracted cerebral arteries without showing significant differences between segments with endothelium and those that had been rubbed; in both cases, 5-HT-induced contractions were significantly higher than those obtained in arteries from control goats. NG-Nitro-l-arginine significantly enhanced the contractile response to 5-HT of cerebral arteries from goats with SAH. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cerebral arteries after SAH exhibit hyperreactivity to 5-HT via a mechanism that involves the absence of the modulatory role of endothelial NO, that SAH does not modify the modulatory role of nonendothelial NO, and that impairment of the modulatory action of endothelial NO on vascular responses to 5-HT could contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after SAH.
