The prevalent use of epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) to prevent rebleeding in the preoperative management of ruptured intracranial aneurysms raises the question of a relationship between this drug and cerebral vasospasm. The effects of EACA on the contractile properties of the rat common carotid artery were measured in vitro, and the effects of EACA on the catecholamine content of these arteries were determined qualitatively. When carotid artery segments from rats that had been infused with lactated Ringer's solution alone were incubated in the presence of 1 mM EACA, they exhibited a decrease in contractile activity brought about by the presence of either serotonin or norepinephrine, and an increase in contractile activity when potassium chloride was used. These changes were not witnessed if the arterial segments came from rats that had been infused with lactated Ringer's solution containing EACA. No effect of epsilon aminocaproic acid was found on the median effective dose values for each vasoconstrictor used. Fluorescence histochemistry showed no qualitative changes in the catecholamine content of carotid arteries following EACA treatment.
