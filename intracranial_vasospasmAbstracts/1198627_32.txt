In this cooperative study among 13 institutions, 502 patients were treated with antifibrinolytic medication (epsilon-aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) within a 14-day period following rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. Mortality at the end of 14 days was 11.6%; proved rebleed rate was 12.7%. Patients with an internal carotid or anterior cerebral aneurysm had the highest mortality and rebleed rate. Most rebleeds occurred between the sixth and eleventh days following the initial bleed. Significantly higher mortality was reported among patients with cerebral vasospasm, yet rebleed rate was no different among those patients with or without vasospasm. The same pattern was observed among patients with a mean blood pressure value above and below 110 mm Hg. We conclude that antifibrinolytic therapy provides beneficial treatment to patients with recent onset subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) following rupture of an intracranial aneurysm.
