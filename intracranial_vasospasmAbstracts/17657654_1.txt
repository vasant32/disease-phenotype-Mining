OBJECTIVE: In bacterial shunt infection, CNS inflammation is a frequently observed complication that may cause vascular complications including vasospasms. Here, we describe the first patient with shunt infection-induced cerebral vasospasms. METHODS: A 35 year old woman with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt that was implanted years before developed facial nerve palsy and somnolence one week before admission to the hospital. RESULTS: After admission, the shunt was removed, and an external ventricular drainage was inserted. Microbiological analyses revealed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus on abdominal and cranial catheters. Follow-up NMR showed infarctions. Transcranial doppler sonography and cerebral arteriography revealed severe generalized cerebral vasospasms. Inspite of triple-H therapy and intraarterial spasmolysis, bilateral anterior and media artery infarction evolved. The patient was dismissed in a vegetative state. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that severe cerebral vasospasms are a serious complication in patients with bacterial shunt infection that should be considered in patients, that don't improve following adequate antibiotic treatment.
