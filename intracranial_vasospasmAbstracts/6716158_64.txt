A group of 112 consecutive patients who initially had no neurological deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was followed intensively for at least 1 year. Ninety-four were in neurological Grade I or II (Hunt and Hess classification) on arrival. A hundred patients underwent late surgery but, despite excellent surgical results, major morbidity and mortality rates were observed related to preoperative complications. In the preoperative period, 14 (13%) rebled, 41 (37%) had symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, and 24 (21%) had hydrocephalus that required treatment. Of the 100 surgical patients, 73 were in Grade I or II, 26 in Grade III, and one in Grade IV. Six patients had intraoperative neurological complications, and two had delayed postoperative cerebral infarction. Six patients died during hospitalization, but only one as a result of operation. Six others died during the year following discharge of causes unrelated to the operation. The ultimate functional outcome at 1 year of these initially good-risk patients was poor. Only 46% were fully recovered, and 25% reported emotional or psychological disturbances that interfered with their daily lives. Forty-four percent could return to their previous jobs or a comparable position, and 20% obtained lesser employment. Management mortality at 1 year was 11%, and morbidity related to persistent neurological deficits (mainly strokes from vasospasm) was 20%. Thus, management mortality and morbidity at 1 year was 31%, and the number of patients returning to useful life was disappointing. The authors support the suggestion by previous workers that an analysis of at least the 6-month and perhaps the 1-year outcome (especially management mortality for all patients) provides the most important parameter for judging outcome and comparing different management protocols for SAH.
