OBJECTIVE: Chronic cerebral vasospasm is resistant to conventional treatments despite recent advances in treatment modalities. We studied the preventive effect of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation on development of vasospasm and its mechanism in a rat femoral artery model. METHODS: The rat femoral artery model for vasospasm was used in this investigation (n = 108). The femoral arteries were divided into four groups: empty and no irradiation (control), UV irradiation (UV group), blood placement (VS group), and blood placement after UV irradiation (VS + UV group). Luminal area was measured, and smooth muscle cell counts in the medial layer of the vessel wall were obtained. An immunohistochemical study was performed with cross sections of fixed femoral arteries at 12 hours and 1, 3, 5, 7, and 49 days after blood placement. The rings of femoral arteries on Day 7 were subjected to pharmacological study. RESULTS: Pretreatment with UV irradiation (VS + UV group) resulted not only in significant inhibition of chronic vasospasm but also in a significant decrease in smooth muscle cells compared with the VS group on Days 5 and 7. The UV-treated arteries (UV and VS + UV groups) exhibited a significant number of Bax- and Bcl-2-positive cells on Days 5 and 7, but few CPP-32 positive cells were observed at the same time points. In the pharmacological study, contractile response to KCI or phenylephrine was reduced significantly in the UV-treated arteries. CONCLUSION: These results imply that UV irradiation prevents chronic vasospasm and suggest that UV-induced cell death plays an important role in the preventive effect without causing complications during the chronic period.
