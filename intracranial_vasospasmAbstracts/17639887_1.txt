A 52-year-old woman developed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) caused by a ruptured right internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm. Because of the aneurysm configuration, the authors decided to delay surgery and instead undertook serial imaging studies of the aneurysm. The patient remained alert but developed acute bilateral deafness on Day 7. Audiological examination and auditory brainstem responses suggested that the hearing disturbance was cortical in origin. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) angiography showed severe vasospasm in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and moderate vasospasm in the left ICA and MCA. Three-tesla magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed 2 days after the onset of symptoms. Diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted MR images showed an acute infarction in the right insular cortex caused by vasospasm. Perfusion-weighted MR imaging, particularly mean transit time mapping, revealed hypoperfusion in both temporal lobes including the auditory cortex and right auditory radiation. The vasospasm was treated with induction of mild hypertension and hypervolemia. Follow-up MR images, 3D CT angiograms, and audiometry performed 2 weeks after the first examination showed recovery of vasospasm and resolution of perfusion abnormality and hearing disturbance. On Day 26, the aneurysm was successfully occluded with clips and the patient was discharged with no deficits. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of reversible cortical auditory dysfunction purely due to bilateral cerebral vasospasm detected using perfusion MR imaging after SAH.
