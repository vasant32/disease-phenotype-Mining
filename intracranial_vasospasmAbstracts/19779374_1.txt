Vasospasm is an important cause of morbidity and mortality with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The effect of intraperitoneal administration of selenium, which is an antioxidant on cerebral vasospasm was investigated in an experimental model. By means of intracisternal blood injection model, SAH was induced in 24 rabbits, which were randomly divided into 3 groups (group 1= control group, group 2=SAH alone group, and group 3=SAH plus selenium group). Basilar artery angiography was performed on day 0 and day 3 as described. Intraperitoneal selenium (0.05 mg/kg) treatment was started after the induction of SAH and administered once a day. Three days later, the animals were killed and the basilar artery was examined histologically for the luminal diameter and thickness of the arterial muscular wall. The mean values for the measurements of angiographic luminal diameter, pathologic luminal area, muscular wall thickness derived from the blind observer were analyzed statistically. There was no statistically significant difference in basal angiographic luminal diameter evaluation between groups 1-2-3 (P>0.005). But in third day angiography; comparison of group 2 and group 1-3 showed statistically significant differences (P<0.001). In pathologic investigation; there was statistically significant difference in luminal area and muscular wall thickness of the basilar artery between groups 1, 2, and 3 (P<0.005). Intraperitoneal selenium treatment was found effective by increasing the angiographic diameter; pathologic luminal area and reducing muscular wall thickness measurements. This is the first study to show that intraperitoneal administration of selenium is effective in preventing vasospasm after SAH in rabbits.
