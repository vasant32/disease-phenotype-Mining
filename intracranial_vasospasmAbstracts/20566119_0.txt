Summary: We used fluoroscopic guidance and over-thewire techniques to superselectively place a microcatheter into a branch of the MCA of three macaques and MRI bolus tracking techniques to measure perfusion within the selected brain region. Such techniques are likely to be useful in the assessment and treatment of ischemic infarction, cerebral vasospasm, and monitoring local delivery of drugs into the brain.
