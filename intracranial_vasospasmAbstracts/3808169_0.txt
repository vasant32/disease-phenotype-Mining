In spite of scientific progress during the last two decades, microsurgery, neuroanesthesiology, and a better knowledge of the pathophysiology of cerebral vasospasm, the outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage (S.A.H.) patients remains very poor. Each year, 28,000 North Americans are afflicted. Eighteen thousand of these patients will either die or become severely debilitated, a mortality morbidity of 64%. Only one patient out of five may return to the premorbid state. International cooperative studies report that the highest rate of rebleeding occurs during the first 24 hours post S.A.H. There is no rebound phenomenon during the 7th-8th day post S.A.H. Cerebral vasospasm begins during the 2d-4th day post S.A.H. and reaches its peak around the 8th day post bleed. Antifibrinolytics like AMICAR (aminocaproic acid) do not reduce significantly the rebleeding rate. In most of the cases the therapeutic level of these drugs is reached only on the third or fourth day of treatment. Hence antifibrinolytics are inactive during the first crucial seventy two hours. Antifibrinolytics increase the incidence of vasospasm, hydrocephalus, and thromboembolic phenomenon. At Infant Jesus Hospital, Quebec City, S.A.H. patients are operated on early since more than two years. Patients included in this study were admitted between January 1983 and December 1984. One hundred and thirty six patients were operated upon, 22 patients operated on acutely, less than 72 hours post S.A.H. Evaluation of these patients included the Glasgow Coma Scale (G.C.S.), the grade according to Botterell classification, a CT Scan, and angiography. A preoperative evaluation included Botterell classification and G.C.S., a post operative evaluation was performed during the first and seventh post operative days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
