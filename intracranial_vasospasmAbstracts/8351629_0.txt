Cerebral infarction in the setting of vasospasm due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a known complication of aneurysmal rupture. Computed tomography (CT) has been instrumental in making this diagnosis; however, focal hypodense lesions on CT scan do not always represent infarcted tissue. Two patients are presented here who had CT hypodense lesions in regions of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.
