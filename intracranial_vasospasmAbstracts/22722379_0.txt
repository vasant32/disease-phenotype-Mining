 BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of thiocolchicoside to prevent cerebral vasospasm in a rabbit model of subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS: Twenty-four adult male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into three groups of eight rabbits each: group 1 (control), group 2 (subarachnoid hemorrhage), group 3 (treatment). Thiocolchicoside (4 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered just before intracisternal blood injection and continued for 72 h once a day in the same dose for group 3. Animals were killed 72 h after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Basilar artery cross-sectional areas and arterial wall thicknesses were measured in all groups. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal administration of thiocolchicoside was found to attenuate cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbits. Thiocolchicoside treatment was determined to be effective in increasing the luminal area and reducing the wall thickness of the basilar artery. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, for the first time, showed that TCC can prevent vasospasm induced by SAH. Our results also showed that GABAergic activity may play an important role in cerebral vasospasm etiopathogenesis. In conclusion, the thiocolchicoside treatment might be beneficial in preventing vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, thus showing potential for clinical application.
