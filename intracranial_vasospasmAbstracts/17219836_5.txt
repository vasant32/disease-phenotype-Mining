OBJECT: Endothelin 1 (ET-1) is a major cause of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and extracellular Cal++ influx plays an essential role in ET-1-induced vasospasm. The authors recently demonstrated that ET-1 activates two types of Ca"-permeable nonselective cation channels (designated NSCC-1 and NSCC-2) and a store-operated Cal++ channel (SOCC) in vascular smooth-muscle cells located in the basilar arteries (BAs) of rabbits. In the present study, they investigate the effects of phospholipase C (PLC) on ET-1-induced activation of these Ca++ channels and BA contraction by using the PLC inhibitor U73122. Methods. To determine which Cal++ channels are activated via a PLC-dependent pathway, these investigators monitored the intracellular free Cal++ concentration ([Ca++]i). The role of PLC in ET-1-induced vascular contraction was examined by performing a tension study of rabbit BA rings. The U73122 inhibited the ET-1-induced transient increase in [Ca++]i, which resulted from mobilization of Ca++ from the intracellular store. Phospholipase C also inhibited ET-1-induced extracellular Ca++ influx through the SOCC and NSCC-2, but not through the NSCC-1. The U73122 inhibited the ET-1-induced contraction of the rabbit BA rings, which depended on extracellular Cal++ influx through the SOCC and NSCC-2. Conclusions. These results indicate the following. (1) The SOCC and NSCC-2 are stimulated by ET-1 via a PLC-dependent cascade whereas NSCC-1 is stimulated via a PLC-independent cascade. (2) The PLC is involved in the ET-1-induced contraction of rabbit BA rings, which depends on extracellular Ca++ influx through the SOCC and NSCC-2.
