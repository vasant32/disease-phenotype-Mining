Circulating immune complexes (CIC) and complement activation (plasma C3d levels) were monitored during a 2-week period in patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms and also in patients with cerebral hematoma unrelated to saccular aneurysms. Thirteen of 18 aneurysm patients were found to have CIC on admission as compared to three of 21 healthy blood donors (p less than 0.001). The presence of CIC in aneurysm patients was associated with a poor prognosis. Eight of nine patients who developed angiographic vasospasm had CIC on admission compared with one of four without vasospasm. Patients with vasospasm showed a twofold increase in plasma C3d levels at the time when the spasm occurred, whereas no significant changes in the C3d concentration could be demonstrated in aneurysm patients without spasm or in patients with hematoma unrelated to aneurysm rupture. These findings suggest that immunological processes involving complement-activating immune complexes are involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm following rupture of saccular aneurysms.
