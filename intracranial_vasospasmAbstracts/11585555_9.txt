The aim of this study was to investigate whether vascular remodeling occurs during cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Beta-actin mRNA expression and structural change of its 3' untranslated region (UTR) which are considered a non-specific marker for vascular remodeling, were examined by Northern analysis and polymerase chain reaction analysis in a canine basilar artery after experimental SAH. The changes in the area of tunica media in the basilar artery were also examined histopathologically. Increased beta-actin mRNA expression and its structural changes of 3' UTR in the vasospastic basilar artery were markedly seen 7 and 14 days after SAH accompanied by increased area of tunica media in the basilar artery. The results suggest that vascular remodeling occurs and takes part in the luminal narrowing during cerebral vasospasm.
