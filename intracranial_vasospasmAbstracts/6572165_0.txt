1. Despite extensive research no explanation has been put forward to account for the fact that cerebral arterial spasm complicates the course of disease of many but not all patients suffering from rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. Although vasoactive material in hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) most probably is of major importance in the pathophysiology of delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have failed to demonstrate a correlation between CSF vasoconstrictor activity and the development of delayed cerebral vasospasm. 2. In the present study the reactivity of isolated human pial arteries to various vasoactive agents [prostaglandin F2 alpha, noradrenaline, serotonin, human plasma and CSF from patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)] was investigated. 3. There was a very marked variability in the spectrum of responses between arteries from different individuals with regard to the contractile responses to plasma, hemorrhagic CSF and amines. On the other hand, the contractions produced by prostaglandin F2 alpha and potassium were consistent. 4. The markedly individual profile in terms of reactivity toward vasoactive substances emphasizes the importance of a human cerebral vessel wall factor and may explain the capricious occurrence of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH.
