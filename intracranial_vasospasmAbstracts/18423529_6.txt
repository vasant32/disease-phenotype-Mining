 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aneurysmal SAH is often followed by delayed ischemic deficits attributable to cerebral vasospasm. Recent studies suggest a positive impact of statin therapy on the incidence of vasospasm. This study was designed to assess whether a history of prior use of statin therapy was associated with a lower risk of vasospasm in patients with SAH. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive retrospective review of patients with aneurysmal SAH between 1997 and 2004. Clinical demographics and imaging data for all patients were reviewed, and a logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of cerebral vasospasm, defined as a combination of clinical signs with radiographic confirmation. RESULTS: Three hundred eight patients were included. Mean age was higher in the group receiving statins (64 +/- 12 vs 54 +/- 12 years). Hunt and Hess scores and treatment modality were not significantly different between the groups. Vasospasm was observed in 31% of patients not taking a statin (n = 282) vs 23% taking a statin (n = 26), without achieving statistical significance. Discontinuation of the statin did not affect risk of vasospasm. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a statin prior to an aneurysmal SAH trended to reduce the incidence of subsequent vasospasm, without achieving statistical significance.
