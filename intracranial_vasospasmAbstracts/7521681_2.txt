The reversal of endothelin-1 induced cerebral vasospasm with Iloprost was studied in the rabbit. Vasospasm in the basilar artery was evaluated by angiography; cerebral ischaemia by 'red-neurone-count' on light microscopy and morphological changes by electron microscopy. A potent antagonistic effect of Iloprost against ET-1 was observed in each of the parameters measured.
