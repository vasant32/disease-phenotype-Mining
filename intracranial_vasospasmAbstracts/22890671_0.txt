 INTRODUCTION: Matricellular protein (MCP) is a class of nonstructural and secreted extracellular matrix proteins that exert diverse functions, but its role in vascular smooth muscle contraction has not been investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: First, rat subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) models were produced by endovascular perforation and examined for tenascin-C (TNC) and osteopontin (OPN) induction (representatives of MCPs) in vasospastic cerebral arteries using immunostaining. Second, recombinant TNC (r-TNC), recombinant OPN (r-OPN), or both were injected into a cisterna magna in healthy rats, and the effects on the diameter of basilar arteries were determined using India ink angiography. RESULTS: In SAH rats, TNC immunoreactivity was markedly induced in the smooth muscle cell layers of spastic cerebral arteries on day 1 but not in control animals. The TNC immunoreactivity decreased on day 3 as vasospasm improved: OPN immunoreactivity, on the other hand, was more induced in the arterial wall on day 3. r-TNC injections caused prolonged contractions of rat basilar arteries, which were reversed by r-OPN, although r-OPN itself had no effect on the vessel diameter. CONCLUSIONS: MCPs, including TNC and OPN, may contribute to the pathophysiology of cerebral vasospasm and provide a novel therapeutic approach against it.
