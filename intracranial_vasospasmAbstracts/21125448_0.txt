 BACKGROUND: the aim of this study was to assess and to compare the ability of intrathecal flunarizine and nimodipine to prevent vasospasm in a rabbit model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHOD: forty male New Zealand white rabbits were allocated into 5 groups randomly. The treatment groups were as follows: (1) control (no SAH [n = 8]), (2) SAH only (n = 8), (3) SAH plus vehicle (n = 8), (4) SAH plus nimodipine (n = 8), and (5) SAH plus flunarizine (n = 8). Before sacrifice, all animals underwent femoral artery catheterization procedure by open surgery under anesthesia and angiography performed for each animal. FINDINGS: there was a statistically significant difference between the mean basilar artery cross-sectional areas and the mean arterial wall thickness measurements of the control and SAH-only groups (p < 0.05). Basilar artery vessel diameter and luminal section areas in group 4 were significantly higher than in group 2 (p < 0.05). Basilar artery vessel diameter and basilar artery luminal section areas in group 5 were significantly higher than in group 2 (p < 0.05).Basilar artery vessel diameter and basilar artery luminal section areas in group 5 were significantly higher than in group 4 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: these findings demonstrate that flunarizine has marked vasodilatatory effect in an experimental model of SAH in rabbits.
