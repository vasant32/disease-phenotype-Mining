The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a known potent intrinsic cerebral vasodilator, is contained in the sensory nerves from trigeminal ganglia that inervate the cerebral arteries. We previously reported that human alpha CGRP (hCGRP) dilates spastic cerebral arteries after experimental subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) in rabbits. In the present study, we investigated the prophylactic potential of a sustained higher cerebrospinal fluid level of hCGRP against experimental cerebral vasospasm. An hCGRP slow-release tablet (hCGRP s-r tablet) was developed for cisternal implantation. Experimental SAH was induced by percutaneous cisternal injection of autologous arterial blood. Angiography was initiated on day 1 (before SAH) and performed everyday. The hCGRP s-r tablet was implanted into the cisterna magna on day 2 in the treated groups. The spastic response of the basilar artery was maximized on day 4 in the non-treated (80.7% of day 1) and the placebo-treated (79.3%) groups. In contrast, the arterial diameters on day 4 were 96.1% and 90.5% of day 1 in the groups implanted with hCGRP 24 micrograms and 153 micrograms s-r tablets, respectively. We also measured the concentration of hCGRP in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following implantation of the hCGRP 24 micrograms s-r tablet in the cisterna magna. The hCGRP concentration before implantation was below the dectable level. Following implantation, the hCGRP level in the CSF was 23.12 nmol/L on the second day and remained at elevated levels until the fifth day. These experiments suggest that the intrathecal single implantation of the hCGRP s-r tablet could produce an elevated concentration of hCGRP in the CSF over five days and have prevented the cerebral vasospasm after SAH in the rabbit. The hCGRP s-r tablet may be clinically applicable in the treatment of patients with SAH against cerebral vasospasm.
