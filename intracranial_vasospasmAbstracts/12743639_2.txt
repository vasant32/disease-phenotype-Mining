The delayed cerebral vasoconstriction known as cerebral vasospasm remains a significant cause of permanent neurological deficit and death following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage despite the best current medical therapies. The mechanism of cerebral vasospasm remains unknown. Several new drugs have been tested in animal models of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and these experimental studies have contributed to a better understanding of the potential mechanisms that lead to cerebral vasospasm. In this article, the authors highlight recent advances in the various treatment procedures for delayed cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. (c) 2001 Prous Science.
