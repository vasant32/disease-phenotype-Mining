We evaluated the usefulness of three-dimensional CT angiography (3D-CTA) for the diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Eleven patients with SAH who were suspected of having cerebral vasospasm on the basis of their clinical symptoms were examined by 3D-CTA with a spiral CT scanner after an intravenous bolus administration of contrast medium. 3D-CTA revealed vasospastic changes of the cerebral vessels in eight patients. Conventional angiography was performed in six patients immediately after the 3D-CTA examination, and demonstrated the cerebral vasospasm. In eight patients, a second 3D-CTA was performed with the same technique one week after the first 3D-CTA examination. The second 3D-CTA showed the cerebral vessels without vasospastic change. In conclusion, 3D-CTA is a promising, minimally invasive strategy for the assessment of cerebral vasospasm.
