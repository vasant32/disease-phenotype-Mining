Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome can occur at any time in the course of pregnancy and is associated with many complications including fatal stroke. A 37-year-old female presented with HELLP syndrome causing an intracerebral hematoma, which was treated by evacuation and mild hypothermia. Unexpected diffuse cerebral swelling occurred on the 15th day of the initially favorable postoperative course. Considerable impairment of consciousness persisted despite conservative therapy. Serial computed tomographic findings indicated delayed cerebral vasospasm as the cause of the swelling. Particularly careful management is required even beyond the first 2 weeks for patients with stroke as a complication of HELLP syndrome.
