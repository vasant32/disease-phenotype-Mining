 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral vasospasm resistant to medical management frequently requires intra-arterial spasmolysis. Angiographic resolution of vasospasm does not provide physiologic data on the adequacy of reperfusion. We recorded pre- and postspasmolysis PbO(2) data in the endovascular suite to determine whether this physiologic parameter could be used to determine when successful reperfusion was established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients with 10 Licox monitors and cerebral vasospasm underwent intra-arterial spasmolysis. Pre- and postspasmolytic PbO(2) was recorded for comparison. Other physiologic parameters, such as CPP, ICP, SaO(2), and Fio(2), were also recorded. RESULTS: Mean prespasmolysis PbO(2) recordings were 35.2 and 27.3 for the mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe vasospasm group, respectively. Mean postspasmolysis PbO(2) increased to 40.3 and 38.4, respectively, which was statistically significant (P < .05) for both groups. In 100% of instances in the moderate-to-severe group and 83% of instances in mild-to-moderate group, the mean PbO(2) increased after spasmolysis and correlated with improvement in angiographic vasospasm. Other physiologic parameters, such as CPP, ICP, SaO(2), and Fio(2), did not show any statistically significant difference before and after spasmolysis. CONCLUSIONS: PbO(2) monitoring provides the interventionalist with an objective physiologic parameter to determine adequate spasmolysis. Further investigation is needed to establish target PbO(2) rates indicative of adequate reperfusion, which can be used in the endovascular suite.
