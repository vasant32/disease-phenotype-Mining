Administration of sumatriptan in subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) patients, misdiagnosed as migraine patients, may induce symptomatic cerebral vasospasm with potentially dangerous consequences. Over a 5-year period, we observed three patients with a 3-15-year history of migraine, who received sumatriptan for acute headache. Two patients received 6 mg sumatriptan subcutaneously on days 4 and 6, and one patient 3 x 100 mg sumatriptan orally on day 1 after an acute headache episode. In all three cases, an alleviation of headache intensity from severe to moderate was observed. When headache recurred and meningeal signs appeared, SAH was diagnosed by computed tomography in all three cases. No neurological deficits occurred during the further course of the disease. In both patients with a SAH caused by an aneurysm, transcranial Doppler sonography demonstrated vasospasm of the basal cerebral arteries. An antinociceptive effect of sumatriptan can be observed in SAH patients in good clinical condition, which suggests a specific craniovascular antinociceptive action. This may lead to misdiagnosis as migraine and delayed appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
