The paper contains results of clinical investigation of influence of intravenous infusion of 6% Hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4/9:1 (Voluven, Fresenius Kabi) on cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolism and ICP in 7 patients with cerebral angiospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. It's shown that such infusion in patients with cerebral vasospasm doesn't lead to ICP elevation but can cause regional volumetric blood flow rising and improving of cerebral metabolism.
