Cerebral vasospasm remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The availability of a mouse model of SAH that is simple, replicable and has low mortality would provide a powerful approach for understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to post-SAH pathologies. The present study characterizes a mouse model of experimental SAH, which produces consistent constriction of large cerebral arteries. Adult mice received injections of autologous blood into the cisterna magna, and the diameters of large intracranial vessels were measured 1 h to 7 days post-SAH. A diffuse blood clot was evident in both the anterior and posterior circulations after SAH. Vascular wall thickening, lumenal narrowing and corrugation of the internal elastic lamina were observed. Both acute (6-12 h) and delayed (1-3 days) phases of vasoconstriction occurred after SAH. Overall mortality was only 3%. A reproducible, low mortality model of SAH-induced cerebral vasospasm in mice is described. This mouse model should facilitate the delineation of cellular and molecular mechanisms of SAH-induced pathologies because of the widespread availability of various technologies for this species (e.g. genetically-altered animals and gene expression arrays). This model also represents a replicable and inexpensive approach for screening therapeutic candidates.
