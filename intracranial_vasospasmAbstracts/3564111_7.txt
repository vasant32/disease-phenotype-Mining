Experimental delayed cerebral vasospasm was produced in canine basilar arteries by 2 successive injections, 2 days apart, of fresh autogenous arterial blood into the cisterna magna. When angiographic evidence of delayed vasospasm was confirmed 7 days after the initial intracisternal blood injection, a selective inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, 2-(12-hydroxydodeca-5,10-diynyl)-3,5,6-trimethyl-1,4-benzoqu inone (AA-861), was infused intravenously at 6.5 X 10(-4) mg/kg/min for 2 hours. However, angiographic evidence of delayed vasospasm was not reversed, and mean regional cerebral blood flow was not significantly increased. In other studies, oral doses of AA-861 at 100 mg/kg/day were given twice a day for 7 days after the initial intracisternal blood injection. In the treated group, angiographic evidence of delayed vasospasm was significantly reduced, and the contractile property of excised basilar arteries in response to vasoconstrictor agents was significantly improved. It is suggested that leukotrienes, 5-lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid, might be important etiologic factors responsible for the development of delayed vasospasm and that AA-861 would have a therapeutic effect not on the reduction of delayed vasospasm once developed but on the prevention of the development of delayed vasospasm.
