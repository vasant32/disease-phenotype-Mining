This study was designed to examine the preventive effect of a novel endothelin (ET)-receptor antagonist TA-0201 on the cerebral vasospasm in a canine double-hemorrhage model. TA-0201 (10(-9)-10(-7) M) inhibited ET-1-induced vasoconstriction in the isolated canine basilar artery without endothelium in a concentration-dependent manner. Its pA2 value was 9.2 (ET(A) antagonism). In a canine double-hemorrhage model, intravenous treatment with TA-0201 (3 mg/kg, twice a day for 7 days) ameliorated the basilar artery narrowing significantly on day 7 compared with that in nontreated dogs. The reductions of the basilar artery diameter were 26.1+/-3.9% and 40.5+/-4.1% with and without TA-0201 treatment, respectively (p<0.05). Histologic study on day 7 indicated that treatment with TA-0201 inhibited vessel-wall damage such as disintegration of endothelium architecture and degeneration of medial smooth-muscle cells. We conclude that intravenous treatment with TA-0201 prevents the development of cerebral vasospasm and accompanying pathologic changes of the vessel wall, probably through blockade of ET(A) receptors.
