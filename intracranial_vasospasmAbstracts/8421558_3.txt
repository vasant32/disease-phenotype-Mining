The oxidized breakdown products of hemoglobin are important in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm because of their effects on the endothelium and the smooth muscle of the arterial wall. Cytoskeletal changes in cultured vascular cells are sensitive indicators of oxidative injury. Cultured endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells showed a dose-related disruption of the cytoskeleton, particularly the F-actin and vimentin filaments, when exposed to 10(-5) M oxyhemoglobin. The cytoskeletal injury was prevented by the addition of 10(-3) M deferoxamine or 1% albumin. These experiments support a role for deferoxamine in the pharmacological treatment of vasospasm. Furthermore, cytoskeletal studies of cultured arterial endothelial and smooth muscle cells provide a novel in vitro approach by which to study the cellular mechanisms of oxidant injury initiated by the breakdown products of hemoglobin.
