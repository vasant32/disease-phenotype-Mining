Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is released excessively in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and vasodepression is its main effect on the blood vessels. The aim of the study was to investigate the changes in ANP secretion in the cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in SHRs. The SAH was induced by the injection of 100 microliters of unheparinized, autologous blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via a canule formerly inserted into the cisterna magna (CM). In the sham SAH group the SAH was imitated with 0.9% saline injection. The concentrations of ANP in the blood samples obtained in the acute and chronic stages of vasospasm were radioimmunoassayed with commercial RIA kits (Peninsula RIK 9103). It was found that both SAH and sham SAH induced a significant increase in plasma ANP in the chronic phase of vasospasm. No such changes were observed in the acute phase. This shows that the chronic cerebral vasospasm following SAH considerably enhances the ANP secretion in SHRs, probably through the increased endothelin release. These compensatory and regulatory mechanisms help prevent the development of brain oedema and the progression of vasopasm through secondary vasodilation.
