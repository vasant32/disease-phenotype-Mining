OBJECTIVE: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is an important part of the body's natural response to acute illness. Adrenal insufficiency has the potential to lead to hemodynamic instability and electrolyte imbalances, limit the body's ability to respond to stress, and worsen overall clinical outcome. In this case series, we describe 16 patients evaluated for acute adrenal insufficiency after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Over a 2-year period, the medical records of 16 patients admitted to the adult neurosurgery service for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who were nonresponsive to vasopressor therapy and received cosyntropin for the evaluation of adrenal insufficiency within 14 days of their event were reviewed. INTERVENTION: The median baseline cortisol in this population was 22.5 microg/dL, with a poststimulation cortisol level of 31 microg/dL. Of the population surveyed, a total of 11 patients met the preestablished criteria for adrenal insufficiency, 3 with baseline cortisol levels of less than 15 microg/dL and 11 with poststimulation concentration changes of less than 9 microg/dL. Baseline serum cortisol concentrations were significantly correlated with hospital stay (P = 0.045), intensive care unit stay (P = 0.005), and ventilator days (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: To date, this is the only investigation evaluating the incidence of acute relative adrenal insufficiency in this population. In our cohort, 69% of the patients met the preestablished criteria for relative adrenal insufficiency. The impact of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in this population also needs review, as it could have significant implications for the management of cerebral vasospasm.
