The effect of 2,2'-dipyridyl (DP) on cerebral vasospasm was investigated in a double-injection rabbit model of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Thirty-six animals were divided between four groups: control (sham-operated), SAH (model alone), SAH + DP (the SAH model in which DP dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide [DMSO] was injected once daily for 5 days into the cisterna magna), and SAH + DMSO (the SAH model in which DMSO [vehicle] was injected daily for 5 days). There were significant differences in the basilar artery luminal area, wall thickness, neurological deficit score and vasospasm index between the SAH + DP and SAH groups. There was a significant negative correlation between arterial luminal area and arterial wall thickness, and also between the neurological deficit score and vasospasm index. Cells that were positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labelling (TUNEL) and p53 expression were significantly increased in the SAH + DMSO and SAH groups, but not in the SAH + DP group, versus controls. Thus, DP may attenuate cerebral vasospasm after SAH by suppressing p53-induced apoptosis in the cerebral vessels.
