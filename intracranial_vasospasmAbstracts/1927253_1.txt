A new experimental model is described which can be used as an alternative to study the effects of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in rats. Vasospasm of the basilar artery is induced photochemically after transpalatal illumination of intracisternally injected rose bengal in two different rat strains. Singlet oxygen, generated in the subarachnoid space, elicits vasospasm which has been demonstrated angiographically at 90 min and 24 h after photosensitisation. Sprague Dawley rats responded better than Wistar rats. Dilution of rose bengal in water was more vasospastic than dilution of rose bengal in artificial CSF. Since the action of singlet oxygen is similar to that of free radicals, this experiment gives an argument for the hypothesis that free radicals play a leading role in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
