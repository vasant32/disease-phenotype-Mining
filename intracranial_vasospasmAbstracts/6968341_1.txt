Central nervous system disorders are not uncommon in patients with hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia. Usually these consist of neuropsychiatric disturbances but acute encephalopathies and seizures may occur. A rare manifestation is cerebral infarction. A patient is presented with neuroradiological evidence of infarction caused by cerebral arterial spasm which appears related to hypercalcaemia due to hypervitaminosis D. Arterial spasm is suggested as a possible aetiological factor in focal neurological lesions associated with hypercalcaemia.
