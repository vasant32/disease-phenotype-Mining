OBJECTIVE: Delayed cerebral vasospasm is an under-recognized complication of meningitis. This case report is important because it is the first to definitively associate vasospasm with meningitis using catheter angiography. Furthermore, it is the first to correlate the time course of delayed cerebral vasospasm with meningitis. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a patient who developed a partial expressive aphasia 9 days after developing meningitis, consistent with cerebral vasospasm, after lumbosacral spinal surgery. INTERVENTION: Vasospasm was confirmed by angiography and transcranial Doppler sonography, and symptoms responded to hypervolemia, hypertension, and hemodilution therapy. CONCLUSION: If a patient develops neurological symptoms consistent with a timeline of delayed cerebral vasospasm in the setting of meningitis, angiographic evaluation and appropriate therapy should be pursued.
