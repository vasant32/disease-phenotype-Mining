Von Willebrand factor (vWF) plays an important role in the coagulation system. It affects platelet aggregation in the place of vessel endothelium damage. The importance of vWF in cerebrovascular disease is not clear. The aim of this presentation was to evaluate the vWF level in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage including cases with cerebral vasospasm and cerebral infarct. We investigated 66 patients (38 persons graded I-III H&H and 28 persons graded IV H&H). The control group consists of 8 subjects. VWF was measured by ELISA method using standard kit Asserachrom (Boehringer). The vWF level in the plasma reached 288.81 +/- 99.66% (in the control group, 98.84 +/- 14.53%) without significant differences regarding clinical condition of patients. In the cerebrospinal fluid the vWF level was significantly different in I-III H&H patients and in IV H&H patients (1.21 +/- 0.52% and 9.18 +/- 7.58%, respectively, p < 0.001) and in the control group (0.13 +/- 0.33%). Our data indicate that there is correlation (Pearson, p < 0.01) between the level of vWF and neurological condition (GCS) of patients. There is also correlation (p < 0.01) between the level of VWF and the presence of clinical disorders (cerebral vasospasm, delayed neurological deficit (DIND) and cerebral infarct). Based on multivariate analysis, we confirmed that vWF is an independent prognostic factor of cerebral vasospasm (p < 0.01) and ischemic complications (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: vWF is elevated in the plasma of patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage in early stage of the disease. VWF is present in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with SAH and its level is higher in patients with poor neurological condition. The VWF elevation in csf is correlated with clinical condition of patients and also the presence of cerebral vasospasm and cerebral infarct. VWF can be used as an independent prognostic factor of cerebral vasospasm and ischemic complications.
