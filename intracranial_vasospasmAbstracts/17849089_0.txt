INTRODUCTION: Intracerebral hemorrhages are relatively rare events in children and cerebral vasospasm after such hemorrhages is even more unusual. Children with structural congenital heart disease are particularly at risk for both thrombotic and embolic events but not to isolated hemorrhages. DISCUSSION: We report a case of cerebral vasospasm in a child with structural congenital heart disease after a cerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates that this rare occurrence must be swiftly recognized and treated in order to maximize clinical outcome.
