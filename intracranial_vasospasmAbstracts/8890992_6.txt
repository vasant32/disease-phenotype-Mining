To prevent symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, we have used hypervolaemia (HV) or volume expansion in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) in recent years. In these patients we could not perform effective fluid and sodium (Na) replacement because of rapid and overwhelming water and Na loss. Although this phenomenon is characteristic under hypervolaemic states, we regard it important to elucidate the mechanism underlying initiation of vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH. Patients with aneurysmal SAH, operated on within 24 hours of onset, were analysed prospectively. We selected 17 patients in good pre-operative condition. Intravascular volume expansion was accomplished with plasma fractionate or albumin and crystalloid solutions in all patients. We divided the 17 patients into two groups; symptomatic spasm group (S-group) consisting of 4 cases developing transient ischaemic symptoms and non-symptomatic spasm group (NS-group) consisting of 13 cases. In S-group, rapid and marked natriuresis developed characteristically before the onset of ischaemic symptoms. The differences in daily Na balance between the two groups were significant on the 3rd and 5th days (p < 0.05). The mean cumulative Na balance in S-group during the 10 days of the study (-375 +/- 159 mEg) was higher than that of NS-group (-24.4 +/- 225 mEq) (p < 0.05). Rapid natriuresis preceded the development of ischaemic symptoms, and was important as a trigger for symptomatic vasospasm after SAH. We considered that hormonal disorders were implicated in this phenomenon, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin, and aldosterone were each measured three times during the period, with no significant differences, found between the two groups. It was speculated that another potent natriuretic factor, similar to ANP, induced a rapid selective natriuresis resulting in symptomatic vasospasm.
