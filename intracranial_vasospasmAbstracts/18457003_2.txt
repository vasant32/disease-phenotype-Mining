3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely used clinically for their lipid lowering properties. Recent evidence shows that statins are also effective in ameliorating cerebral vasospasm, which occurs as sequelae of subarachnoid haemorrhage. This review focuses on the pleiotropic effects of statins, and the putative mechanisms involved in statin mediated attenuation of cerebral vasospasm.
