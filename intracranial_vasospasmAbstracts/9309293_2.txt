Lipid peroxidation and enhanced arachidonic acid metabolism is activated after blood-brain cell contact. Previous studies have indicated that cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LT) have the capacity to constrict arterial vessels in vivo and in vitro suggesting their involvement in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm. The purpose of this study was to measure the amount of cyst-LT in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) in correlation with transcranial Doppler findings (TCD) in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). In all patients early surgery was performed. In the first cisternal CSF-sample which was already collected intra-operatively an initial peak of cys-LT was detected, followed by decreasing amounts of cys-LT during the next 5 days. The CSF-levels of immunoreactive cys-LT were significantly higher in those patients who showed signs of vasospasm on transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) (p < 0.001). Normalization of TCD values was accompanied by decreasing levels of CSF-cys-LT. We found a significant correlation between the amounts of immunoreactive cys-LT in cerebrospinal fluid and cerebral vasospasm measured by TCD.
