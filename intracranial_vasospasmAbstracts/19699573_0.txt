A patient with Prinzmetal's variant angina (PVA) developed a cardiac arrest due to coronary vasospasm and subsequent myocardial infarction. After resuscitation postanoxic brain injury was diagnosed. After an initial improvement of consciousness he deteriorated rapidly on the seventh day after admission due to severe brain ischaemia apparently caused by cerebral vasospasm, until ultimately brain death was diagnosed. To our knowledge, the association between PVA and cerebral vasospasm has never been described. The combination suggests that this patient had a generalized vasospastic disorder.
