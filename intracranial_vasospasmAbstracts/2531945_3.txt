We investigated the possible relation between neuropeptides and cerebral vasoconstriction in samples of ventricular or cisternal cerebrospinal fluid from 14 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Neuropeptide Y, calcitonin gene-related peptide, atrial natriuretic peptide, and pituitary polypeptide 7B2 were present in the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients. Concentrations of calcitonin gene-related peptide and 7B2 were not significantly different from those in control subjects, but that of atrial natriuretic peptide was significantly lower. Although the mean concentration of neuropeptide Y was not significantly higher than control, consecutive determinations showed an increase 6-11 days after the onset of subarachnoid hemorrhage. An initially high 7B2 concentration decreased gradually, although half the patients showed a second increase greater than 10 days after the onset. Considering the well-recognized vasoconstrictive effect of neuropeptide Y, it is possible that this increase in its concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid plays a role in the pathogenesis of the cerebral vasospasm that is often seen after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
